            The effect of optimized maternal therapy by bactericidal agents was evaluated in a reproducible rabbit model of
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            maternofetal infection simulating human pharmacokinetics. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was begun in the pregnant rabbit 12 h after bacterial intrauterine inoculation, using a computer-controlled pump to simulate human pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone (1 g/day) associated or not with gentamicin (3 mg/kg of body weight/day). Data were compared for fetal survival, quantitative blood cultures, fetal histology in treated versus untreated groups, and maternal and fetal antibiotic concentrations in plasma in treated animals. Antibiotic therapy led to dramatic improvement in maternal outcome (100% survival versus 100% death in the untreated group in association with maternal septicemia). Fetal survival also improved, with the two-drug combination providing a more potent effect. After 3 days of treatment, 32% of fetuses survived with one-drug therapy and 62% with two-drug therapy (Yates corrected χ

In untreated animals, bacterial counts in blood cultures increased rapidly during the first 24 h up to 8.1 ± 0.5 log CFU/ml, but remained relatively constant at all times with antibiotic treatment: 4.5 ± 0.7 log CFU/ml at the start of treatment and 6.2 ± 0.4 and 5.2 ± 0.9 log CFU/ml after 72 h for one- and two-drug therapy, respectively (data are means ± standard deviations). The failure of animals to be cured after 3 days of treatment was not due to an inadequate concentration of ceftriaxone, as the residual level in fetal serum at sacrifice was more than 1,000 times the MIC of the microbe. Unexpectedly, inflammation in fetal lung decreased in the treated group after as little as 24 h of antibiotic therapy, despite persistent bacteremia. Although maternal outcome improved and drug concentrations were above the MIC, the treatment did not achieve sterilization of fetuses in utero for this rabbit

In 2002, one isolate resistant to metronidazole (MIC = 64 μg/ml) was noted. These data indicate changes in susceptibility over time; surprisingly, some antimicrobial agents are more active now than they were 5 years ago.

A total of 628 patients were enrolled and assessed by evaluation of their clinical and bacteriological responses 5 to 7 days and 21 to 28 days after administration of the last dose of study medication. Although the trial was designed, on the basis of predefined outcomes, to demonstrate the equivalence of the two regimens, the results showed statistically significant higher clinical success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.4%, and for comparator regimen, 85.4%; difference [Δ], 8.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91 to 13.19%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

This superiority was seen irrespective of the severity of the pneumonia and whether or not the combination therapy included a macrolide. The time to resolution of fever was also statistically significantly faster for patients who received moxifloxacin (median time, 2 versus 3 days), and the duration of hospital admission was approximately 1 day less for patients who received moxifloxacin. The treatment was converted to oral therapy immediately after the initial mandatory 3-day period of i.v. administration for a larger proportion of patients in the moxifloxacin group than patients in the comparator group (151 [50.2%] versus 57 [17.8%] patients). There were fewer deaths (9 [3.0%] versus 17 [5.3%]) and fewer serious adverse events (38 [12.6%] versus 53 [16.5%]) in the moxifloxacin group than in the comparator group. The rates of drug-related adverse events were comparable in both groups (38.9% in each treatment group). The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. Thus, it is concluded that monotherapy with moxifloxacin is superior to that with a standard combination regimen of a β-lactam and a β-lactamase inhibitor, co-amoxiclav, with or without a macrolide, clarithromycin, in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to a hospital.

            E1210 is a first-in-class, broad-spectrum antifungal with a novel mechanism of action—inhibition of fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis. In this study, the efficacies of E1210 and reference antifungals were evaluated in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. Oral E1210 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in infections caused by

            . In conclusion, E1210 demonstrated consistent efficacy in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. These data suggest that further studies to determine E1210's potential for the treatment of disseminated fungal infections are indicated.

          <jats:p>The elimination of viral covalently closed circular DNA (CCC DNA) from the nucleus of infected hepatocytes is an obstacle to achieving sustained viral clearance during antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment with adefovir, a new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, the prodrug of which, adefovir dipivoxil, is in clinical evaluation, is able to suppress viral CCC DNA both in vitro and in vivo using the duck HBV (DHBV) model. First, the effect of adefovir on viral CCC DNA synthesis was examined with primary cultures of DHBV-infected fetal hepatocytes. Adefovir was administered for six consecutive days starting one day before or four days after DHBV inoculation. Dose-dependent inhibition of both virion release in culture supernatants and synthesis of intracellular viral DNA was observed. Although CCC DNA amplification was inhibited by adefovir, CCC DNA was not eliminated by antiviral treatment and the de novo formation of CCC DNA was not prevented by pretreatment of the cells. Next, preventive treatment of experimentally infected ducklings with lamivudine or adefovir revealed that both efficiently suppressed viremia and intrahepatic DNA. However, persistence of viral DNA even when detectable only by PCR was associated with a recurrence of viral replication following drug withdrawal. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adefovir is a potent inhibitor of DHBV replication that inhibits CCC DNA amplification but does not effectively prevent the formation of CCC DNA from incoming viral genomes.</jats:p>",en,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,NA,2002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils in the genomes of eubacteria. Fluoroquinolones (FQs), successful as drugs clinically, target the enzyme to trap the gyrase-DNA complex, leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in the genome. Mycobacteria are less susceptible to commonly used FQs. However, an 8-methoxy-substituted FQ, moxifloxacin (MFX), is a potent antimycobacterial, and a higher susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to MFX has been demonstrated. Although several models explain the mechanism of FQ action and gyrase-DNA-FQ interaction, the basis for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to various FQs is not understood. We have addressed the basis of the differential susceptibility of the gyrase and revisited the mode of action of FQs. We demonstrate that FQs bind both

            Influenza virus infections are known to persist longer in patients with underlying diseases, including respiratory tract diseases, and tend to become complicated by secondary influenza-associated infections, such as pneumonia. To assess the efficacy and safety of the novel anti-influenza virus drug peramivir in high-risk patients, we conducted a clinical trial of patients with diabetes or chronic respiratory tract diseases and patients being treated with drugs that suppress immune function. In this multicenter, uncontrolled, randomized, double-blind study, peramivir was intravenously administered at 300 or 600 mg/day for 1 to 5 days, as needed. Efficacy was investigated in 37 patients (300 mg,

            = 19 patients). The median durations of influenza illness were 68.6 h (90% confidence interval, 41.5 to 113.4 h) overall, 114.4 h (90% confidence interval, 40.2 to 235.3 h) in the 300-mg group, and 42.3 h (90% confidence interval, 30.0 to 82.7 h) in the 600-mg group. The hazard ratio for the 600-mg group compared to the 300-mg group was 0.497 (90% confidence interval, 0.251 to 0.984), and the duration of influenza illness was significantly shorter in the 600-mg group than in the 300-mg group. Among the 42 patients in the safety analysis set, adverse events occurred in 73.8% and adverse drug reactions in 33.3%. No adverse events were particularly problematic clinically, and all patients recovered quickly from all events. The measured blood drug concentrations showed no tendency toward accumulation. Drug accumulation with repeated doses was thus considered to be of little concern. Intravenous peramivir appears to offer a potentially useful treatment for high-risk patients in the future.

            . Mechanistically, treatment of human macrophages with HDACi at the time of bacterial infection enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation by these cells. The capacity of HDACi to promote the clearance of intracellular bacteria from human macrophages was abrogated when cells were pretreated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos, which perturbs mitochondrial function. The HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin A promoted bacterial clearance from human macrophages, whereas the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275, which inhibits HDAC1 to -3, had no effect on intracellular bacterial loads. These data are consistent with HDAC6 and/or related HDACs constraining mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production from human macrophages during bacterial challenge. Our findings suggest that, whereas long-term HDACi treatment regimes may potentially compromise host defense, selective HDAC inhibitors may have applications in treating acute bacterial infections.

            Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 remain major human pathogens despite the development of anti-HSV therapeutics as some of the first antiviral drugs. Current therapies are incompletely effective and frequently drive the evolution of drug-resistant mutants. We recently determined that certain natural troponoid compounds such as β-thujaplicinol readily suppress HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication. Here, we screened 26 synthetic α-hydroxytropolones with the goals of determining a preliminary structure-activity relationship for the α-hydroxytropolone pharmacophore and providing a starting point for future optimization studies. Twenty-five compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at 50 μM, and 10 compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 5 μM, with similar inhibition patterns and potencies against both viruses being observed. The two most powerful inhibitors shared a common biphenyl side chain, were capable of inhibiting HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) of 81 to 210 nM, and also strongly inhibited acyclovir-resistant mutants. Moderate to low cytotoxicity was observed for all compounds (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ] of 50 to &gt;100 μM). Therapeutic indexes ranged from &gt;170 to &gt;1,200. These data indicate that troponoids and specifically α-hydroxytropolones are a promising lead scaffold for development as anti-HSV drugs provided that toxicity can be further minimized. Troponoid drugs are envisioned to be employed alone or in combination with existing nucleos(t)ide analogs to suppress HSV replication far enough to prevent viral shedding and to limit the development of or treat nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant mutants.

            BSI were identified. Of these, 34 had received fluconazole and 35 had received an echinocandin/L-AmB-based regimen. Patients in the echinocandin/L-AmB group had poorer baseline clinical status than did those in the fluconazole group. Patients in the fluconazole group were more frequently (55.9% versus 28.6%) and much earlier (median time, 3 versus 7 days) switched to another antifungal regimen. Overall, 14-day mortality was 13% (9/69) and treatment failure 34.8% (24/69), with no significant differences between the groups. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for baseline characteristics by propensity score, fluconazole use was not associated with an unfavorable evolution (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for 14-day mortality, 1.16, with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.22 to 6.17; adjusted OR for treatment failure, 0.83, with 95% CI of 0.27 to 2.61). In conclusion, initial fluconazole treatment was not associated with a poorer outcome than that obtained with echinocandins/L-AmB regimens in patients with

            The purpose of the present study was to determine if a relationship exists between the plasma cholesterol concentration, the severity of amphotericin B (AmpB)-induced renal toxicity, and the pharmacokinetics of AmpB in plasma in hypercholesterolemic rabbits administered multiple doses of amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate (Doc-AmB) and AmB lipid complex (ABLC). After 7 days of administration of a cholesterol-enriched diet (0.50% [wt/vol]) or a regular rabbit diet, each rabbit was administered a single intravenous bolus of Doc-AmB (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 10) (1.0 mg/kg of body weight) daily for 7 consecutive days (a total of eight doses). Blood samples were obtained daily before and 24 h after the administration of each dose and serially thereafter following the administration of the last dose for the assessment of pharmacokinetics in plasma, kidney toxicity, plasma lipoprotein levels, and drug distribution in tissue. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood following the administration of ABLC were also determined in rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched and regular diets (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 3 each group). Before drug treatment, cholesterol-fed rabbits demonstrated marked increases in total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol levels in plasma compared with the levels in rabbits on a regular diet. No significant differences in total plasma triglyceride levels were observed. Significant increases in plasma creatinine levels were observed in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) and rabbits fed a regular diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) when administered AmB. However, the magnitude of this increase was twofold greater in rabbits fed a regular diet than in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. An increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed only in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered ABLC. The pharmacokinetics of AmB were significantly altered in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered Doc-AmB or ABLC compared to those in rabbits on a regular diet administered each of these compounds. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood were significantly different following ABLC administration but not following Doc-AmB administration in both rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched diets and rabbits fed regular diets compared to their corresponding pharmacokinetics in plasma. An increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the TRL fraction when Doc-AmB was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet than when it was administered to rabbits fed a regular diet. Furthermore, an increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the LDL and TRL fractions when ABLC was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet rabbits fed a regular diet. These findings suggest that an increase in plasma cholesterol levels modifies the pharmacokinetics of AmB and renal toxicity following the administration of multiple intravenous doses of Doc-AmB and ABLC.

            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            168 but also under conditions of LipA overproduction. Notably, SkfA has bactericidal activity and, probably, requires the SkfB to SkfD proteins for its production. The present results show that LipA is more prone to proteolytic degradation in the absence of SkfA and that high-level LipA production can be improved significantly by employing multiple protease-deficient
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            strains. In conclusion, our findings imply that SkfA protects LipA, directly or indirectly, against proteolytic degradation. Conceivably, SkfA could act as a modulator in LipA folding or as a protease inhibitor.

            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoters exhibited very low levels of basal expression, while extremely high levels of expression were observed upon induction with subtilin. Moreover, the level of expression depended directly on the amount of inducer (subtilin) used. The wild-type
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoter appeared to be more strictly controlled by the addition of subtilin, while the highest levels of expression were obtained when the mutated

Since the SURE system has attractive functional characteristics, including promoter silence under noninducing conditions and a controlled and high level of expression upon induction, and since it is not subject to catabolite control, we anticipate that it can provide a suitable expression system for various scientific and industrial applications.

          <jats:p>
            Target site inaccessibility represents a significant problem for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 16S rRNA with oligonucleotide probes. Here, unlabeled oligonucleotides (helpers) that bind adjacent to the probe target site were evaluated for their potential to increase weak probe hybridization signals in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            DSM 30083
            <jats:sup>T</jats:sup>
            . The use of helpers enhanced the fluorescence signal of all six probes examined at least fourfold. In one case, the signal of probe Eco474 was increased 25-fold with the use of a single helper probe, H440-2. In another case, four unlabeled helpers raised the FISH signal of a formerly weak probe, Eco585, to the level of the brightest monolabeled oligonucleotide probes available for
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            . The temperature of dissociation and the mismatch discrimination of probes were not significantly influenced by the addition of helpers. Therefore, using helpers should not cause labeling of additional nontarget organisms at a defined stringency of hybridization. However, the helper action is based on sequence-specific binding, and there is thus a potential for narrowing the target group which must be considered when designing helpers. We conclude that helpers can open inaccessible rRNA regions for FISH with oligonucleotide probes and will thereby further improve the applicability of this technique for in situ identification of microorganisms.

            , respectively), in 0.02 and 0.2 M buffer solutions. At the highest ionic strength, we did not observe a significant difference in the attachment rate of wild-type and paralyzed cells at either fluid velocity. However, when the ionic strength was reduced, paralyzed bacteria attached at rates 4 and 10 times lower than that of the wild type under fluid velocities of 0.0044 and 0.044 cms
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>

We then compared the attachment rates of smooth-swimming (counterclockwise rotation only) and tumbly (clockwise rotation only) cells to the wild type to determine whether the direction of rotation was important to cell attachment. At 0.0044 cms
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
            , the smooth-swimming cells attached at rates similar to that of the wild type in both buffer solutions but significantly less at the higher fluid velocity. Tumbly cells attached at much lower rates under all conditions. Thus, the combination of clockwise and counterclockwise flagellar rotation and their coupling appeared to be important in cell attachment. We considered a number of hypotheses to interpret these observations, including a residence time analysis and a comparison of traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to soft-particle theory.

            Five different methods were used to identify yeast isolates from a variety of citrus juice sources. A total of 99 strains, including reference strains, were identified using a partial sequence of the 26S rRNA gene, restriction pattern analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (5.8S-ITS), classical methodology, the RapID Yeast Plus system, and API 20C AUX. Twenty-three different species were identified representing 11 different genera. Distribution of the species was considerably different depending on the type of sample. Fourteen different species were identified from pasteurized single-strength orange juice that had been contaminated after pasteurization (PSOJ), while only six species were isolated from fresh-squeezed, unpasteurized orange juice (FSOJ). Among PSOJ isolates,
            <jats:italic>Candida intermedia</jats:italic>

            is a gram-positive thermophile that produces considerable amounts of ethanol from soluble sugars and polymeric substrates, including starch. Growth on maltose, a product of starch hydrolysis, was associated with the production of a prominent membrane-associated protein that had an apparent molecular weight of 43,800 and was not detected in cells grown on xylose or glucose. Filter-binding assays revealed that cell membranes bound maltose with high affinity. Metabolic labeling of

            C]palmitic acid showed that this protein was posttranslationally acylated. A maltose-binding protein was purified by using an amylose resin affinity column, and the binding constant was 270 nM. Since maltase activity was found only in the cytosol of fractionated cells and unlabeled glucose did not compete with radiolabeled maltose for uptake in whole cells, it appeared that maltose was transported intact. In whole-cell transport assays, the affinity for maltose was approximately 40 nM. Maltotriose and α-trehalose competitively inhibited maltose uptake in transport assays, whereas glucose, cellobiose, and a range of disaccharides had little effect. Based on these results, it appears that

            oxidized formate and lactate with electrodes and Fe(III) as terminal electron acceptors, though with reduced efficiency compared to acetate. The structure of the formate and lactate biofilms increased in roughness, and the substratum coverage decreased, to alleviate the metabolic constraints derived from the assimilation of carbon from the substrates. Low levels of acetate promoted formate carbon assimilation and biofilm growth and increased the system's performance to levels comparable to those with acetate only. Lactate carbon assimilation also limited biofilm growth and led to the partial oxidization of lactate to acetate. However, lactate was fully oxidized in the presence of fumarate, which redirected carbon fluxes into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and by acetate-grown biofilms.

The 33 mutants spanned an activity range between ∼0.6% and 19.6-fold of the wild-type promoter activity with an almost linear fluorescence intensity distribution. After an extensive characterization of the library, the broader applicability of the results obtained with the yEGFP reporter was confirmed using two additional reporters (β-galactosidase and methionine adenosyltransferase [MAT]) at the transcription and enzyme activity levels. Furthermore, the utility of the promoter library was tested by investigating the influence of heterologous MAT gene expression levels on cell growth and

            belonging to serogroups O:3, O:5,27 and O:9. Enterocoliticin was purified, and electron micrographs of enterocoliticin preparations revealed the presence of phage tail-like particles. The particles did not contain nucleic acids and showed contraction upon contact with susceptible bacteria. Enterocoliticin addition to logarithmic-phase cultures of susceptible bacterial strains led to a rapid dose-dependent reduction in CFU. Calorimetric measurements of the heat output of cultures of sensitive bacteria showed a complete loss of cellular metabolic activity immediately upon addition of enterocoliticin. Furthermore, a dose-dependent efflux of K

Using logistic regression techniques, pH, temperature, time, and concentration were modeled in separate segments of the data set, resulting in prediction equations for: (i) no preservatives, before F-T; (ii) no preservatives, after F-T; (iii) sorbate, before F-T; (iv) sorbate, after F-T; (v) benzoate, before F-T; and (vi) benzoate, after F-T. Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant (

To ensure safety, use of the models is most appropriate at a 0.9 probability level, where the percentage of false positives, i.e., falsely predicting a 5-log

          <jats:p>Bacterial communities reside in basal ice, sediment, and meltwater in the supra-, sub-, and proglacial environments of John Evans Glacier, Nunavut, Canada. We examined whether the subglacial bacterial community shares common members with the pro- and supraglacial communities, and by inference, whether it could be derived from communities in either of these environments (e.g., by ice overriding proglacial sediments or by in-wash of surface meltwaters). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes amplified from these environments revealed that the subglacial water, basal ice, and sediment communities were distinct from those detected in supraglacial meltwater and proglacial sediments, with 60 of 142 unique terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) detected exclusively in subglacial samples and only 8 T-RFs detected in all three environments. Supraglacial waters shared some T-RFs with subglacial water and ice, likely reflecting the seasonal flow of surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system, whereas supraglacial and proglacial communities shared the fewest T-RFs. Thus, the subglacial community at John Evans Glacier appears to be predominantly autochthonous rather than allochthonous, and it may be adapted to subglacial conditions. Chemical analysis of water and melted ice also revealed differences between the supraglacial and proglacial environments, particularly regarding electrical conductivity and nitrate, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Whereas the potential exists for common bacterial types to be broadly distributed throughout the glacial system, we have observed distinct bacterial communities in physically and chemically different glacial environments.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA,2006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>
            -alanine addition. The concentrations of germinable endospores were determined by comparison to a standard curve. Parallel EVA and phase-contrast microscopy experiments to determine the percentage of germinable spores yielded comparable results (54.3% ± 3.8% and 48.9% ± 4.5%, respectively), while only 27.8% ± 7.6% of spores produced CFU. EVA was applied to monitor the inactivation of spore suspensions as a function of UV dose, yielding reproducible correlations between EVA and CFU inactivation data. The 90% inactivation doses were 2,773 J/m

The first ice core contained 295 ± 19 germinable spores/ml and 369 ± 36 total spores/ml (i.e., the percentage of germinable endospores was 79.9% ± 9.3%), and the second core contained 131 ± 4 germinable spores/ml and 162 ± 17 total spores/ml (i.e., the percentage of germinable endospores was 80.9% ± 8.8%), whereas only 2 CFU/ml were detected by culturing.

            The current study was designed to investigate the impact of genetic heterogeneity on host immune responses to pulmonary intracellular infection by using two mouse strains of distinct genetic background, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and a model intracellular pathogen,
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            BCG. Upon infection, compared to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice developed an earlier response of interleukin 12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage chemoattractive protein 1, and greater neutrophilic influx to the lung by days 7 and 14. However, the level of these cytokines at days 27, 43, and 71 was much lower in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. The magnitude of cellular responses was also much lower in the lung of BALB/c mice around day 27. Histologically, while C57BL/6 mice developed lymphocytic granulomas, BALB/c mice displayed atypical granulomas in the lung. Of importance, the level of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 remained low and similar in the lung of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice throughout. Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from systemic and local lymphoid tissues of infected BALB/c mice demonstrated a markedly lower antigen-specific IFN-γ recall response. While the number of mycobacterial bacilli recovered from both the lung and spleen of BALB/c mice was similar to that in C57BL/6 mice at day 14, it was higher than that in C57BL/6 mice at day 43. However, it was eventually leveled off to that in C57BL/6 counterparts later. These results suggest the following: (i) genetic heterogeneity can lead to differential innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses to primary pulmonary mycobacterial infection; (ii) it is the level of adaptive, but not innate, immune response that is critical to host resistance; and (iii) a lower type 1 immune response in BALB/c mice is not accompanied by a heightened type 2 response during pulmonary mycobacterial infection.

            . We identified a single-stranded circularized form of the RS1 element, in addition to the CTXΦ genome, in nucleic acids extracted from phage preparations of 32 out of 83 (38.5%) RS1-positive toxigenic

Auxotrophies for alanine, asparagine, or proline attenuated intracellular replication in HeLa cells, while aspartate, asparagine, or proline auxotrophies attenuated intracellular replication in RAW264.7 macrophages. The different patterns of intracellular attenuation of alanine- or aspartate-auxotrophic strains support distinct nutritional conditions in HeLa cells and RAW264.7 macrophages.

            infection. The most severe outcomes for patients include coma, permanent neurological deficits, and death. Recently, a large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in humans identified brain swelling as the most prominent predictor of fatal HCM. Therefore, in this study, we sought to define the mechanism controlling brain edema through the use of the murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model. Specifically, we investigated the ability of CD8 T cells to initiate brain edema during ECM. We determined that areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability colocalized with a reduction of the cerebral endothelial cell tight-junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. Furthermore, through small-animal MRI, we analyzed edema and vascular leakage. Using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, we determined that vascular permeability is not homogeneous but rather confined to specific regions of the brain. Our findings show that BBB permeability was localized within the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and lateral ventricle. Concurrently with the initiation of vascular permeability, T2-weighted MRI revealed edema and brain swelling. Importantly, ablation of the cytolytic effector molecule perforin fully protected against vascular permeability and edema. Furthermore, perforin production specifically by CD8 T cells was required to cause fatal edema during ECM. We propose that CD8 T cells initiate BBB breakdown through perforin-mediated disruption of tight junctions. In turn, leakage from the vasculature into the parenchyma causes brain swelling and edema. This results in a breakdown of homeostatic maintenance that likely contributes to ECM pathology.

            complex (Bcc) cause chronic opportunistic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in a gradual lung function decline and, ultimately, patient death. The Bcc is a complex of 20 species and is rarely eradicated once a patient is colonized; therefore, vaccination may represent a better therapeutic option. We developed a new proteomics approach to identify bacterial proteins that are involved in the attachment of Bcc bacteria to lung epithelial cells. Fourteen proteins were reproducibly identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from four Bcc strains representative of two Bcc species:
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Burkholderia cenocepacia</jats:named-content>
            , the most virulent, and
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">B. multivorans</jats:named-content>
            , the most frequently acquired. Seven proteins were identified in both species, but only two were common to all four strains, linocin and OmpW. Both proteins were selected based on previously reported data on these proteins in other species.
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</jats:named-content>
            strains expressing recombinant linocin and OmpW showed enhanced attachment (4.2- and 3.9-fold) to lung cells compared to the control, confirming that both proteins are involved in host cell attachment. Immunoproteomic analysis using serum from Bcc-colonized CF patients confirmed that both proteins elicit potent humoral responses
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Mice immunized with either recombinant linocin or OmpW were protected from

            challenge. Both antigens induced potent antigen-specific antibody responses and stimulated strong cytokine responses. In conclusion, our approach identified adhesins that induced excellent protection against two Bcc species and are promising vaccine candidates for a multisubunit vaccine. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of our proteomics approach to identify potent antigens against other difficult pathogens.

            phage 71 was used to prove the genetic linkage of transposon insertions and altered phenotypes. Mapping of the different transposon insertions by Southern hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that these were inserted in four unlinked genetic loci. According to their phenotypes, including quantitative differences in biofilm production in different growth media, in the amount of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) produced, in the hemagglutination titers, and in the altered colony morphology, the mutants could be separated into four phenotypic classes corresponding with the genetic classes. Synthesis of PIA was not detectable with class I and II mutants, whereas the amount of PIA produced reflected the residual degree of biofilm production of class III and IV mutants in different growth media. Chromosomal DNA flanking the transposon insertions of five class I mutants was cloned and sequenced, and the insertions were mapped to different locations of

            Previous studies have suggested that interleukin-4 (IL-4) has a protective effect in host defense to
            <jats:italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            infection, both in limiting the severity of arthritis and in controlling spirochete numbers in tissues, and a mapping study revealed suggestive linkage to a cluster of genes on mouse chromosome 11, including the genes for IL-4 and IL-13. In contrast, other studies have questioned the importance of IL-4. In this study the involvement of IL-4 in murine Lyme disease was examined in C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice with targeted disruptions in the IL-4 gene, the IL-4Rα chain gene, or both. A spectrum of arthritis severity was seen in BALB/cJ mice, and ablation of IL-4, IL-4Rα, or both had no effect on the overall severity of arthritis as determined by joint swelling and histopathology. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice exhibited mild to moderate arthritis, and ablation of IL-4 again had no effect on arthritis severity. IL-4- and IL-4Rα-deficient mice produced extremely low levels of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and showed increased production of IgG2b. This shift in immunoglobulin isotype had no effect on the host's ability to control spirochete growth in either strain of mouse, as determined by PCR detection of
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            DNA from heart and ankle tissues. In summary, the IL-4-IL-4Rα pathway, including IL-13 signaling, neither limits arthritis severity nor is required for control of spirochete growth during

          <jats:p>In renal bacterial infections granulocytes are of major importance in the primary immune defense against invading pathogens. However, the mechanisms of granulocytic activation in renal interstitial invasion have not been clarified. Renal tubular epithelial cell mechanisms inducing granulocytic activation and bacterial killing may include tubular cell expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), a urinary protein that is known to enhance cytokine expression in monocytes. We studied the role of THP in granulocytic activation. A strong binding of THP to human granulocytes was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Urinary THP and supernatants of THP-expressing cultured tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) enhanced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression by human granulocytes. Renal tubular cells growing polarized on polycarbonate membranes were used to study apical versus basal THP expression. By electron microscopy THP immunoreactivity was exclusively found on the apical surfaces of tubular cells and was absent on the basolateral cell membrane. In the apical cell culture compartment we found significantly more stimulatory activity for granulocytic IL-8 expression. CD62L, a selectin less expressed in activated granulocytes, was decreased in granulocytes incubated with urinary THP and in supernatants of THP-producing renal tubular cells but not in supernatants from THP-negative cells. Again, the effect on CD62L expression was found only in apical culture media and was absent in the basal compartment. In summary our data give evidence that renal tubular cell THP expression may be relevant in kidney diseases since THP is a potent activator of human granulocytes. The regulation of apical versus basal THP expression and release in vivo may be crucial in the induction of the inflammatory response, e.g., in bacterial renal diseases.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA,2002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The presence of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses suggested a mixed Th1- and Th2-type response; there was no correlation between subclass reactivity and the disease course. The recombinant papLe22 specifically activated interleukin-10 production by VL patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at diagnosis and after treatment-induced cure, indicating its contribution to VL pathogenesis and concomitant immunosuppression and its potential role in the reactivation of latent parasites. As a dominant immunogen, papLe22 might be used as a vaccine component, provided that the vaccination protocol directs the response toward the Th1 pattern.

A similar experimental protocol was used to determine if recombinant Cdt proteins were able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce cytokines. The individual Cdt proteins were able to induce the synthesis by PBMCs of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 but not of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-12, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, with CdtC being the most potent and CdtB being the least potent cytokine inducer. There was evidence of synergism between these Cdt proteins in the stimulation of cytokine production, most markedly with gamma interferon, which required the minimum interaction of CdtB and -C to stimulate production.

            The EUO gene of chlamydia is highly expressed early in the developmental cycle, relative to other genes, but continues to be expressed throughout the active growth phases. The precise function of EUO protein is not known, but it binds to DNA in vitro. In this study, we developed a selection and amplification scheme for identifying chlamydial genomic fragments to which EUO preferentially binds in vitro. The scheme involved mixing recombinant EUO with a
            <jats:italic>Chlamydia psittaci</jats:italic>
            genomic library in a pBluescript plasmid vector in vitro, trapping EUO-bound plasmid clones on filters, and amplifying the clones in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            . After nine rounds of enrichment, the EUO binding sites of the three most highly enriched clones were identified by DNase I footprint analysis. All three clones had multiple binding sites of various sizes with no clear distinguishing feature other than they were AT-rich and were usually not located in putative promoter regions. We used limited site-specific mutagenesis to characterize the strongest binding site of the most-highly-enriched clone, which represented about 50% of the population after nine rounds. This mutagenesis identified a core binding site of 15 nucleotides (nt) whose sequence was used to find related sequences within each of the strong binding sites in the other two clones. Using the frequency of bases at specific positions within this group of sequences as a guide, we carried out trial-and-error searching with many related sequences, eliminating those which identified nonfootprinted sites. This process led us to the consensus 15-nt sequence AHGAAAWVTYTWDAY, which, when allowing two mismatches, picked out all of the strong binding sites and no nonfootprinting sites within the three enriched clones. This sequence may be useful for predicting additional possible EUO binding sites in the chlamydial genome.

            Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) and membrane CD14 function to enhance the responses of monocytes to low concentrations of endotoxin. Surprisingly, recent reports have suggested that LBP or CD14 may be dispensable for macrophage responses to low concentrations of LPS or may even exert an inhibitory effect in the case of LBP. We therefore investigated whether LBP and CD14 participated in the response of mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) to LPS stimulation. In the presence of a low amount of plasma (&lt;1%) or of recombinant mouse or human LBP, PEM were found to respond to low concentrations of LPS (&lt;5 to 10 ng/ml) in an LBP- and CD14-dependent manner. However, tumor necrosis factor production (not interleukin-6 production) by LPS-stimulated PEM was reduced when cells were stimulated in the presence of higher concentrations of plasma or serum (5 or 10%). Yet, the inhibitory effect of plasma or serum was not mediated by LBP. Taken together with previous results obtained with

            An effective new vaccine for the control of tuberculosis is badly needed. While current research attempts to improve vaccination are concentrating on new prophylactic or immunotherapeutic vaccines, virtually no emphasis has been placed on boosting individuals already inoculated with
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            BCG. It is shown here that mice vaccinated with BCG gradually lose their capacity to resist an aerosol challenge infection as they age. However, if these mice are inoculated with the 30-kDa mycolyl transferase A protein in midlife, after challenge when aged they express levels of protection in the lungs comparable to those of young mice, associated with minimal pathological damage.

            sensu stricto. The antigens responsible for the induction of arthritis are unknown. Here we provide direct evidence that a major surface protein, outer surface protein A (OspA), can induce arthritis. Hamsters were vaccinated with 30, 60, or 120 μg of recombinant OspA (rOspA) in aluminum hydroxide and challenged with
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            sensu stricto isolate 297 or C-1-11. Swelling of the hind paws was detected in 100, 100, and 50% of hamsters vaccinated with 30, 60, or 120 μg of rOspA, respectively. In addition, arthritis developed in 57% of hamsters vaccinated with a canine rOspA vaccine after infection with
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            sensu stricto. When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with

Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.

            We investigated the role of the functional domains of anthrax toxins during infection. Three proteins produced by
            <jats:italic>Bacillus anthracis</jats:italic>
            , the protective antigen (PA), the lethal factor (LF), and the edema factor (EF), combine in pairs to produce the lethal (PA+LF) and edema (PA+EF) toxins. A genetic strategy was developed to introduce by allelic exchange specific point mutations or in-frame deletions into
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            toxin genes, thereby impairing either LF metalloprotease or EF adenylate cyclase activity or PA functional domains. In vivo effects of toxin mutations were analyzed in an experimental infection of mice. A tight correlation was observed between the properties of anthrax toxins delivered in vivo and their in vitro activities. The synergic effects of the lethal and edema toxins resulted purely from their enzymatic activities, suggesting that in vivo these toxins may act together. The PA-dependent antibody response to LF induced by immunization with live
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            was used to follow the in vivo interaction of LF and PA. We found that the binding of LF to PA in vivo was necessary and sufficient for a strong antibody response against LF, whereas neither LF activity nor binding of lethal toxin complex to the cell surface was required. Mutant PA proteins were cleaved in mice sera. Thus, our data provide evidence that, during anthrax infection, PA may interact with LF before binding to the cell receptor. Immunoprotection studies indicated that the strain producing detoxified LF and EF, isogenic to the current live vaccine Sterne strain, is a safe candidate for use as a vaccine against anthrax.

The results obtained indicate that the composition of the fecal flora is genetically regulated.

            <jats:italic>Streptococcus</jats:italic>
            (GBS) is an important pathogen of neonates, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. GBS isolates associated with human infection produce one of nine antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharides which are thought to play a key role in virulence. A comparison of GBS polysaccharide structures of all nine known GBS serotypes together with the predicted amino acid sequences of the proteins that direct their synthesis suggests that the evolution of serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides has proceeded through en bloc replacement of individual glycosyltransferase genes with DNA sequences that encode enzymes with new linkage specificities. We found striking heterogeneity in amino acid sequences of synthetic enzymes with very similar functions, an observation that supports horizontal gene transfer rather than stepwise mutagenesis as a mechanism for capsule variation. Eight of the nine serotypes appear to be closely related both structurally and genetically, whereas serotype VIII is more distantly related. This similarity in polysaccharide structure strongly suggests that the evolutionary pressure toward antigenic variation exerted by acquired immunity is counterbalanced by a survival advantage conferred by conserved structural motifs of the GBS polysaccharides.

            O139 emerged in 1992 as a major cause of epidemic cholera. However, the incidence of disease due to this new serogroup subsequently decreased for almost a decade. In April 2002, there was a dramatic resurgence of
            <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic>

            O139 during the 2002 epidemic with those dating to the emergence of this disease in 1993 to 1995. Strains isolated from patients in the two time periods were compared with respect to capsular polysaccharide, their resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum, and their capacity to be used as target strains in complement-mediated vibriocidal assays. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that strains isolated in 2002 had less capsular material than those isolated from 1993 to 1995 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = &lt;0.001), a finding confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Strains isolated in 2002 were more susceptible to the bactericidal activity of serum compared to strains from 1993 to 1995 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.013). Compared to results using a standard O139 strain, a modified vibriocidal assay utilizing a 2002 strain, CIRS 134, as the target organism detected higher vibriocidal responses in both O139-infected cholera patients as well as O139 vaccine recipients. The vibriocidal assay utilizing the less encapsulated 2002 strain, CIRS 134, is a more sensitive indicator of adaptive immune responses to recent infection with
            <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic>

            operon promoter can be fully activated by binding of the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) to a site centered at position −41.5 upstream of the transcript start, and this activation is modulated by upstream binding of the integration host factor (IHF) and Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) proteins. Thus, transcription initiation is repressed by the binding of IHF and Fis to sites centered at position −88 (IHF I) and position −142 (Fis I) and activated by IHF binding to a site at position −115 (IHF II). Here, we have exploited mutational analysis and biochemistry to investigate the actions of IHF and Fis at these sites. We show that the effects of IHF and Fis are position dependent and that IHF II functions independently of IHF I and Fis I. Using in vitro assays, we report that IHF and Fis repress transcription initiation by interfering with RNA polymerase binding. Differences in the upstream IHF and Fis binding sites at the

            exists either in a free-living state in the soil or in
symbiosis within legume nodules, where the bacteria differentiate into
nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Expression of genes involved in nitrogen
fixation and associated respiration is governed by two intermediate
regulators, NifA and FixK, respectively, which are controlled by a
two-component regulatory system FixLJ in response to low-oxygen
conditions. In order to identify the FixLJ regulon, gene expression
profiles were determined in microaerobic free-living cells as well as
during the symbiotic life of the bacterium for the wild type and a
            <jats:italic>fixJ</jats:italic>
            null-mutant strain. We identified 122 genes activated by
FixJ in either state, including 87 novel targets. FixJ controls 74% of

genes expressed in mature bacteroids. Ninety-seven percent of

showed that NifA activates a limited number of genes, all specific to
the symbiotic state, whereas FixK controls more than 90 genes, involved

FixJ has no other direct targets besides those already known. FixJ is
involved in the regulation of functions such as denitrification or

            continues to pose a health threat in many developing nations and regions of the world struck by natural disasters. It is a pathogen that rapidly adapts to aquatic environments and the human small intestine. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) may contribute to this adaptability. Specifically, the mannitol operon sRNA (MtlS sRNA; previously designated the IGR7 sRNA) is transcribed antisense to the 5′ untranslated region of the
            <jats:italic>mtl</jats:italic>

            expression in the presence of various carbon sources and the role of the MtlS sRNA. We observed that MtlA protein is present only in cells grown on mannitol sugar, whereas MtlS sRNA is expressed during growth on all sugars other than mannitol. In contrast,
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>
            mRNA is expressed in similar amounts regardless of the carbon source used for bacterial growth. These observations suggest that the regulation of MtlA protein expression is a posttranscriptional event. We further demonstrate that MtlS sRNA overexpression repressed MtlA synthesis without affecting the stability of the messenger and that this process is largely independent of Hfq. We propose a model in which, when carbon sources other than mannitol are present, MtlS sRNA is transcribed, base pairs with the 5′ untranslated region of the

            bacteria, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been recognized as important resistance determinants against antimicrobial peptides. Together with neighboring two-component systems (TCSs), which regulate their expression, they form specific detoxification modules. Both the transport permease and sensor kinase components show unusual domain architecture: the permeases contain a large extracellular domain, while the sensor kinases lack an obvious input domain. One of the best-characterized examples is the bacitracin resistance module BceRS-BceAB of
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            . Strikingly, in this system, the ABC transporter and TCS have an absolute mutual requirement for each other in both sensing of and resistance to bacitracin, suggesting a novel mode of signal transduction in which the transporter constitutes the actual sensor. We identified over 250 such BceAB-like ABC transporters in the current databases. They occurred almost exclusively in

            bacteria, and 80% of the transporters were associated with a BceRS-like TCS. Phylogenetic analyses of the permease and sensor kinase components revealed a tight evolutionary correlation. Our findings suggest a direct regulatory interaction between the ABC transporters and TCSs, mediating communication between both components. Based on their observed coclustering and conservation of response regulator binding sites, we could identify putative corresponding two-component systems for transporters lacking a regulatory system in their immediate neighborhood. Taken together, our results show that these types of ABC transporters and TCSs have coevolved to form self-sufficient detoxification modules against antimicrobial peptides, widely distributed among

            Attenuated total reflection/Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry (ATR/FT-IR) and scanning confocal laser microscopy (SCLM) were used to study the role of alginate and alginate structure in the attachment and growth of
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            on surfaces. Developing biofilms of the mucoid (alginate-producing) cystic fibrosis pulmonary isolate FRD1, as well as mucoid and nonmucoid mutant strains, were monitored by ATR/FT-IR for 44 and 88 h as IR absorbance bands in the region of 2,000 to 1,000 cm

            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>

            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>
            -acetyl group in alginate), as compared to biofilms of nonmucoid mutant strains. Dehydration of an 88-h FRD1 biofilm revealed other IR bands that were also found in the spectrum of purified FRD1 alginate. These results provide evidence that alginate was present within the FRD1 biofilms and at greater relative concentrations at depths exceeding 1 μm, the analysis range for the ATR/FT-IR technique. After 88 h, biofilms of the nonmucoid strains produced amide II absorbances that were six to eight times as intense as those of the mucoid FRD1 parent strain. However, the cell densities in biofilms were similar, suggesting that FRD1 formed biofilms with most cells at depths that exceeded the analysis range of the ATR/FT-IR technique. SCLM analysis confirmed this result, demonstrating that nonmucoid strains formed densely packed biofilms that were generally less than 6 μm in depth. In contrast, FRD1 produced microcolonies that were approximately 40 μm in depth. An
            <jats:italic>algJ</jats:italic>
            mutant strain that produced alginate lacking
            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>
            -acetyl groups gave an amide II signal approximately fivefold weaker than that of FRD1 and produced small microcolonies. After 44 h, the
            <jats:italic>algJ</jats:italic>
            mutant switched to the nonmucoid phenotype and formed uniform biofilms, similar to biofilms produced by the nonmucoid strains. These results demonstrate that alginate, although not required for
            <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            biofilm development, plays a role in the biofilm structure and may act as intercellular material, required for formation of thicker three-dimensional biofilms. The results also demonstrate the importance of alginate O acetylation in
            <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            biofilm architecture.

            family of heat-labile enterotoxins having an AB5 structure. By substituting amino acids in the enzymatic A subunit that are highly conserved in all members of this family, we constructed 23 variants of CT that exhibited decreased or undetectable toxicity and we characterized their biological and biochemical properties. Many variants exhibited previously undescribed temperature-sensitive assembly of holotoxin and/or increased sensitivity to proteolysis, which in all cases correlated with exposure of epitopes of CT-A that are normally hidden in native CT holotoxin. Substitutions within and deletion of the entire active-site-occluding loop demonstrated a prominent role for His-44 and this loop in the structure and activity of CT. Several novel variants with wild-type assembly and stability showed significantly decreased toxicity and enzymatic activity (e.g., variants at positions R11, I16, R25, E29, and S68+V72). In most variants the reduction in toxicity was proportional to the decrease in enzymatic activity. For substitutions or insertions at E29 and Y30 the decrease in toxicity was 10- and 5-fold more than the reduction in enzymatic activity, but for variants with R25G, E110D, or E112D substitutions the decrease in enzymatic activity was 12- to 50-fold more than the reduction in toxicity. These variants may be useful as tools for additional studies on the cell biology of toxin action and/or as attenuated toxins for adjuvant or vaccine use.

The activity of these phosphatases was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, but not by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases. Mutations at the catalytic site motif, cysteine 11 of MPtpA and cysteine 160 of MPtpB, abolished enzyme activity. Southern blot analysis revealed that, while

            The unusual and complex cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria plays a major role in pathogenesis, with specific complex lipids acting as defensive, offensive, or adaptive effectors of virulence. The phthiocerol and phthiodiolone dimycocerosate esters (PDIMs) comprise one such category of virulence-enhancing lipids. Recent work in several laboratories has established that the
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis fadD26-mmpL7</jats:italic>
            (Rv2930-Rv2942) locus plays a major role in PDIM biosynthesis and secretion and that PDIM is required for virulence. Here we describe two independent transposon mutants (WAg533 and WAg537) of
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            , both of which carry an insertion in Mb0100 (=
            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            Rv0097) to reveal a new locus involved in PDIM biosynthesis. The mutations have a polar effect on expression of the downstream genes Mb0101, Mb0102 (

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis shows elevated transcription of genes in the operon upstream from the transposon insertion sites in both mutants. Both mutants have altered colony morphology and do not synthesize PDIMs or glycosylphenol-PDIM. Both mutants are avirulent in a guinea pig model of tuberculosis, and when tested as a vaccine, WAg533 conferred protective immunity against

            ) grow poorly in the presence of the weak organic acids acetate, propionate, and benzoate. This sensitivity is corrected by methionine and seems to result from destabilization of MetA (homoserine transsuccinylase), the first enzyme in methionine biosynthesis. The MetA protein is known to be sensitive to thermal inactivation, and
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants are more sensitive to heat-induced methionine auxotrophy. Peroxide increases the sensitivity of
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants to both heat and acid and may oxidatively damage (carbonylate) destabilized MetA. While acid appears to impair methionine biosynthesis, it leads to derepression of MetA and may inhibit growth by causing toxic accumulation of denatured protein. This is supported by the observation that the overexpression of MetA in
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants causes acid sensitivity that is not corrected by methionine. We propose that polyphosphate acts as a chemical chaperone that helps refold MetA and/or may stimulate proteolysis of toxic denatured protein. The instability of MetA protein may provide a metabolic fuse that blocks growth under conditions that denature proteins; the sensitivity of this fuse is modulated by polyphosphate.

            . Here we explored the base excision repair pathway for the highly mutagenic 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a ubiquitous form of oxidized guanine. In most organisms, 8-oxoG is removed by a specific DNA glycosylase (Fpg in bacteria or OGG1 in eukaryotes). In the case where replication of the lesion yields an A/8-oxoG base pair, a second DNA glycosylase (MutY) can excise the adenine and thus avoid the fixation of the mutation in the next round of replication. In a genetic screen for
            <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Bartonella henselae</jats:italic>
            is the major etiological agent of cat scratch disease in humans. Cats act as the natural reservoir of
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            and can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. The prevalence of
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            in cat populations was evaluated by serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18%) resulted in detection of bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serology; 207 (38%) were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results for 65 (12.2%) showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The molecular typing of the isolates showed that 20.6% of bacteremic cats were infected with
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            type I strain, 61.1% were infected with
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            type II, and 18.3% were coinfected with both. A statistically significant difference in antibody and bacteremia prevalences among geographical areas was detected. Statistical analysis showed no association between characteristics such as seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological test was 84.7%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8%. Receiving operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            infection in a human population, therefore, we suggest the use of blood culture as the reference test. Nevertheless, both blood culture assays and serological tests for
            <jats:italic>Bartonella</jats:italic>
            infection should be performed for a complete evaluation of the health status of cats.

          <jats:p>Supplemental assays, such as recombinant immunoblot assays (RIBA), are used to confirm detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, due to their expense, they are not widely used in developing countries. The purpose of our study was to compare the results of second- and third-generation (G2 and G3, respectively) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and to resolve discordant results by using a supplemental assay to assess the reliability of G2 and G3 EIAs to confirm anti-HCV antibody-positive results. We performed both G2 and G3 EIAs for anti-HCV antibodies on 1,134 serum samples collected during the 2nd year of a longitudinal community-based study in Egypt; 35 samples with discordant results were tested by Abbott Laboratories Micro-Particle Immunoassay (M-EIA) and RIBA. Viremia was determined with an in-house nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect HCV RNA. Concordance between the two assays (G2/G3) was 96.9%; 87 (7.7%) samples were positive and 1,012 (89.2%) were negative by both assays. For 17 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay negative and G3 assay positive, and for 18 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay positive and G3 assay negative. Among the 17 G2 assay-negative and G3 assay-positive samples, 15 were M-EIA positive and 7 were PCR positive. Among the 18 G2 assay-positive and G3 assay-negative samples, 2 were M-EIA positive and none were PCR positive. RIBA results from 24 discordant samples showed 87.5% agreement with the G3 EIA, 12.5% agreement with the G2 EIA, and 95.8% agreement with M-EIA. Eleven samples were indeterminate by RIBA and excluded from this analysis. Based on RIBA results, the sensitivity of the G3 EIA was 99%, compared to 89.8% for the G2 EIA, while the specificity of the G3 EIA was 99.8%, compared to 98.9% for the G2 EIA. These results show that the reliability of the G3 EIA in screening these sera is excellent, and the G3 assay can be used in the absence of supplemental tests where resources are limited. RIBA appears not to have advantages over the less expensive M-EIA screening assay. The main disadvantage of RIBA is the occurrence of indeterminate results, especially among problematic samples. Samples giving discordant results in multiple assays are often indeterminate with the RIBA.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA,2002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            ribotype 027 isolates as the basis for comparison of two capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based ribotyping methods. There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three different primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method. Similar differences between SCGE and QCGE were found on testing of 14 isolates of four other

            into one of the 12 major sublineages or subgroups. All strains could be correctly positioned on the canonical SNP (canSNP) phylogenetic tree, except the divergent Pasteur vaccine strain ATCC 4229. We detected the cooccurrence of three canSNP subgroups in France. The dominant B.Br.CNEVA sublineage was found to be prevalent in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Auvergne region, and the Saône-et-Loire department. Strains affiliated with the A.Br.008/009 subgroup were observed throughout most of the country. The minor A.Br.001/002 subgroup was restricted to northeastern France. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis using 24 markers further resolved French strains into 60 unique profiles and identified some regional patterns. Diversity found within the A.Br.008/009 and B.Br.CNEVA subgroups suggests that these represent old, ecologically established clades in France. Phylogenetic relationships with strains from other parts of the world are discussed.

          <jats:p>Gastrointestinal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among young children and immunocompromised patients. Diarrhea may result from infection with a variety of microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Historically, the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea has been made using microscopy, antigen tests, culture, and real-time PCR. A combination of these traditional tests is often required due to the inability to distinguish between infectious etiologies based on the clinical presentation alone. Recently, several multiplex molecular assays have been developed for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens directly from clinical stool samples. These panels allow for the detection and identification of up to 20 pathogens in as little as 1 h. This review will focus on the multiplex molecular panels that have received clearance from the FDA for the diagnosis of diarrheal disease and will highlight issues related to test performance, result interpretation, and cost-effectiveness of these new molecular diagnostic tools.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Sixty-three clinical isolates of charcoal-black-pigmented, gram-positive coryneform rods were received for identification by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and were provisionally designated CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 (FCG4). Forty-five of these were characterized by morphological, physiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, cellular fatty acids, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses. Nitrate reduction, cellular fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies segregated these strains into two groups: FCG4a (8 strains) and FCG4b (37 strains). The FCG4a strains, only one of which was from a female genitourinary source, produced cellular fatty acid and biochemical profiles similar to those observed with reference strains of
            <jats:italic>Rothia dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Rothia mucilaginosa</jats:italic>
            , while the FCG4b strains were similar to
            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium</jats:italic>
            species. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated species-level relatedness among six FCG4a tested strains and showed that they were a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of
            <jats:italic>R. dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            . Sixteen isolates of the FCG4b group, mainly from female genitourinary tract specimens, as well as the type strains of two recently named species,
            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium aurimucosum</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium nigricans</jats:italic>
            , were shown by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to be related at the species level and unrelated to the type strain of
            <jats:italic>R. dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            ; therefore, the
            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>C. aurimucosum</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>C. nigricans</jats:italic>
            . These findings indicate that FCG4 represents a heterogeneous group that contains pigmented variants of both
            <jats:italic>R. dentocariosa</jats:italic>

            was evaluated with 600 consecutive clinical samples. These samples, including 552 respiratory specimens and 48 nonrespiratory specimens, were collected from 333 patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from September to October 2003. The results of both assays were compared to the gold standard of combined culture results and clinical diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAPID BAP-MTB assay for respiratory specimens were 66.7% and 97.2%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 56.7% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the RAPID BAP-MTB were 74.1% and 96.0%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 59.6% and 94.7%, respectively. For smear-negative samples, the sensitivity of the RAPID BAP-MTB and DTB assays was 57.1% and 40.5%, respectively. The RAPID BAP-MTB assay produced 14 false-positive results in 14 samples, including one of the six samples yielding

Among the 48 nonrespiratory specimens, the RAPID BAP-MTB assay was positive in one biopsy sample from a patient with lumbar tuberculous spondylitis and one pus sample from a patient with tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy. Our results showed that the RAPID BAP-MTB assay is better than the DTB assay for both respiratory specimens and nonrespiratory specimens. The overall time for processing this assay is only 5 h. In addition, its diagnostic accuracy in smear-negative samples is as high as in smear-positive samples.

            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            strains exhibit high genomic diversity. In order to investigate this diversity, the unique genomic DNA sequences from a nonsequenced
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic>
            strain,
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176, were identified by comparison with
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            NCTC 11168 by using a shotgun DNA microarray approach. Up to 63 kb of new chromosomal DNA sequences unique to this pathogen were obtained. Eighty-six open reading frames were identified by the presence of uninterrupted coding regions encoding a minimum of 40 amino acids. In addition, this study shows that the whole-plasmid shotgun microarray approach is effective and provides a comprehensive coverage of DNA regions that differ between two closely related genomes. The two plasmids harbored by this
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic>
            strain, pTet and pVir, were also sequenced, with coverages of 2.5- and 2.9-fold, respectively, representing 72 and 92% of their complete nucleotide sequences. The unique chromosomal genes encode proteins involved in capsule and lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, restriction and modification systems, and respiratory metabolism. Several of these unique genes are likely associated with
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176 fitness and virulence. Interestingly, the comparison of

            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>

            The sixth case of infant botulism in the United Kingdom was reported in 2001. The case was caused by a type B strain of
            <jats:italic>Clostridium botulinum</jats:italic>
            . Strains of
            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            were isolated from the baby's feces and from foodstuffs in the household in an attempt to document transmission. The aims of this study were to characterize the strains of
            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            associated with the botulism case. This was performed using a variety of techniques, including
            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            culture phenotypic properties, neurotoxin characterization, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) banding patterns. Cultures associated with this case as well as isolates from stored and historical samples were analyzed and compared.
            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            type B PFGE patterns from the infant and from an opened container of infant formula were indistinguishable, while the PFGE profile of a strain presumably isolated from an unopened archival container was unique. The results suggest that the unopened brand of formula was not the source for transmission of spores to the infant and that the strain was distinct from previous botulism cases in the United Kingdom. Since environmental testing was not performed, it is not possible to deduce other sources of transmission.

Desiccation can have bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects depending on the species, the material on which the organism has desiccated, and the length of time. The absence of water can damage many cellular components, including enzymes, nucleic acids, and cell membranes (1). However, many prokaryotes have some degree of resistance to desiccation, with Escherichia coli surviving around 24 hours and Bacillus species surviving upwards of 300 years, though these numbers can vary due to a number of confounding factors (5). Some of these factors include the method by which desiccation occurred, whether desiccation occurred in a natural or laboratory situation, and the species itself (5). To address the effects of desiccation on bacterial growth and survival, a short, simple exercise was developed. By inoculating various materials with bacterial cultures and allowing them to air-dry for 24 hours, students can visualize the effects of desiccation by analyzing the growth, or lack thereof, when organisms are transferred to nutrient agar plates. This exercise has been used in a health professions microbiology course as well as a microbiology course for biology and biochemistry majors. It is short enough to be conducted during a standard lecture period or during a longer laboratory period in conjunction with other experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of physical agents on microbial growth</jats:p>",en,J Microbiol Biol Educ.,NA,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            With the recent rise of alternative instructional methodologies such as flipped classrooms and active learning, many core concepts are being introduced outside of the classroom prior to scheduled class meeting times. One popular means for external concept introduction in many undergraduate biology courses is the use of stand-alone online learning modules. Using a group of four large introductory biology course sections, we investigate the use of a stand-alone online learning module developed using animations from Virtual Cell Animation Collection as a resource for the introduction of cellular respiration concepts outside of the classroom. Results from four sections of introductory biology (

These columns are self-sufficient ecosystems that allow researchers to study bacterial populations under specified environmental conditions. Non-science majors identified phototrophic bacteria enriched in the column by analyzing the signature chlorophyll absorption spectra whereas science majors used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the general bacterial diversity. Students then compiled their results and worked together to generate lab reports with their final conclusions identifying the microorganisms present in their column. Surveys and lab reports were utilized to evaluate the learning objectives of this activity. In pre-surveys, nonmajors’ and majors’ answers diverged considerably, with majors providing responses that were more accurate and more in line with the working definition of collaboration. In post-surveys, the answers between majors and nonmajors converged, with both groups providing accurate responses.

            BST2/tetherin inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from cells. Primate lentiviruses have evolved specific antagonists (Vpu, Nef, and Env). Here we characterized tetherin proteins of species representing both branches of the order Carnivora. Comparison of tiger and cat (Feliformia) to dog and ferret (Caniformia) genes demonstrated that the tiger and cat share a start codon mutation that truncated most of the tetherin cytoplasmic tail early in the Feliformia lineage (19 of 27 amino acids, including the dual tyrosine motif). Alpha interferon (IFN-α) induced tetherin and blocked feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) replication in lymphoid and nonlymphoid feline cells. Budding of bald FIV and HIV particles was blocked by carnivore tetherins. However, infectious FIV particles were resistant, and spreading FIV replication was uninhibited. Antagonism mapped to the envelope glycoprotein (Env), which rescued FIV from carnivore tetherin restriction when expressed in

            but, in contrast to known antagonists, did not rescue noncognate particles. Also unlike the primate lentiviral antagonists, but similar to the Ebola virus glycoprotein, FIV Env did not reduce intracellular or cell surface tetherin levels. Furthermore, FIV-enveloped FIV particles actually required tetherin for optimal release from cells. The results show that FIV Envs mediate a distinctive tetherin evasion. Well adapted to a phylogenetically ancient tetherin tail truncation in the Felidae, it requires functional virion incorporation of Env, and it shields the budding particle without downregulating plasma membrane tetherin. Moreover, FIV has evolved dependence on this protein: particles containing FIV Env need tetherin for optimal release from the cell, while Env

            HIV-1 antagonizes the restriction factor tetherin with the accessory protein Vpu, while HIV-2 and the filovirus Ebola use their envelope (Env) glycoproteins for this purpose. It turns out that the FIV tetherin antagonist is also its Env protein, but the mechanism is distinctive. Unlike other tetherin antagonists, FIV Env cannot act in

Also unlike other retroviral antagonists, but similar to Ebola virus Env, it does not act by downregulating or degrading tetherin. FIV Env might exclude tetherin locally or direct assembly to tetherin-negative membrane domains. Other distinctive features are apparent, including evidence that this virus evolved an equilibrium in which tetherin is both restriction factor and cofactor, as FIV requires tetherin for optimal particle release.

            To understand the interplay between host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses and the mechanisms by which HIV-1 evades them, we studied viral evolutionary patterns associated with host CTL responses in six linked transmission pairs. HIV-1 sequences corresponding to full-length p17 and p24
            <jats:italic>gag</jats:italic>
            were generated by 454 pyrosequencing for all pairs near the time of transmission, and seroconverting partners were followed for a median of 847 days postinfection. T-cell responses were screened by gamma interferon/interleukin-2 (IFN-γ/IL-2) FluoroSpot using autologous peptide sets reflecting any Gag variant present in at least 5% of sequence reads in the individual's viral population. While we found little evidence for the occurrence of CTL reversions, CTL escape processes were found to be highly dynamic, with multiple epitope variants emerging simultaneously. We found a correlation between epitope entropy and the number of epitope variants per response (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.43;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.05). In cases in which multiple escape mutations developed within a targeted epitope, a variant with no fitness cost became fixed in the viral population. When multiple mutations within an epitope achieved fitness-balanced escape, these escape mutants were each maintained in the viral population. Additional mutations found to confer escape but undetected in viral populations incurred high fitness costs, suggesting that functional constraints limit the available sites tolerable to escape mutations. These results further our understanding of the impact of CTL escape and reversion from the founder virus in HIV infection and contribute to the identification of immunogenic Gag regions most vulnerable to a targeted T-cell attack.

            Rapid diversification of the viral population is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection, and understanding the selective forces driving the emergence of viral variants can provide critical insight into the interplay between host immune responses and viral evolution. We used deep sequencing to comprehensively follow viral evolution over time in six linked HIV transmission pairs. We then mapped T-cell responses to explore if mutations arose due to adaption to the host and found that escape processes were often highly dynamic, with multiple mutations arising within targeted epitopes. When we explored the impact of these mutations on replicative capacity, we found that dynamic escape processes only resolve with the selection of mutations that conferred escape with no fitness cost to the virus. These results provide further understanding of the complicated viral-host interactions that occur during early HIV-1 infection and may help inform the design of future vaccine immunogens.

We assessed the impact of 10 published B*13-associated polymorphisms in Gag, Pol, and Nef, in 23 biologically relevant combinations, on HIV-1 replication capacity and Nef-mediated reduction of cell surface CD4 and HLA class I expression. Mutations were engineered into HIV-1

When tested individually, only Gag-I147L and Gag-I437L incurred replicative costs (5% and 17%, respectively), consistent with prior reports. The Gag-I437L-mediated replication defect was rescued to wild-type levels by the adjacent K436R mutation. A novel B*13 epitope, comprising 8 residues and terminating at Gag

            Protective effects of HLA-B*13 on HIV-1 disease progression are mediated in part by fitness costs of CTL escape mutations in conserved Gag epitopes, but other mechanisms remain incompletely known. We extend our knowledge of the impact of B*13-driven escape on HIV-1 replication by identifying Gag-K436R as a compensatory mutation for the fitness-costly Gag-I437L. We also identify Gag-I147L, the most rapidly and commonly selected B*13-driven substitution in HIV-1, as a putative C-terminal anchor residue mutation in a novel B*13 epitope. Most notably, we identify a novel escape-driven fitness defect: B*13-driven substitutions E24Q and Q107R in Nef, when present together, substantially impair this protein's ability to downregulate HLA class I. This, in turn, increases the visibility of infected cells to HIV-specific T cells. Our results suggest that B*13-associated escape mutations impair HIV-1 replication by two distinct mechanisms, that is, by reducing Gag fitness and dampening Nef immune evasion function.

          <jats:p>Rhinoviral infection is an important trigger of acute inflammatory exacerbations in patients with underlying airway disease. We have previously established that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is central in the communication between epithelial cells and monocytes during the initiation of inflammation. In this study we explored the roles of IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the responses of airway cells to rhinovirus-1B (RV-1B) and further determined how responses to RV-1B were modified in a model of bacterial coinfection. Our results revealed that IL-1β dramatically potentiated RV-1B-induced proinflammatory responses, and while monocytes did not directly amplify responses to RV-1B alone, they played an important role in the responses observed with our coinfection model. MyD88 is the essential signaling adapter for IL-1β and most Toll-like receptors. To examine the role of MyD88 in more detail, we created stable MyD88 knockdown epithelial cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to MyD88. We determined that IL-1β/MyD88 plays a role in regulating RV-1B replication and the inflammatory response to viral infection of airway cells. These results identify central roles for IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the production of CXCL8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, in viral infection. Thus, IL-1β is a viable target for controlling the neutrophilia that is often found in inflammatory airway disease and is exacerbated by viral infection of the airways.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 × 10

          <jats:p>Previously, we characterized two host protein binding elements located within the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome and assessed their functions in defective-interfering (DI) RNA replication. To determine the role of RNA secondary structures within these two host protein binding elements in viral replication, we explored the secondary structure of the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the MHV strain JHM genome using limited RNase digestion assays. Our data indicate that multiple stem-loop and hairpin-loop structures exist within this region. Mutant and wild-type DIssEs were employed to test the function of secondary structure elements in DI RNA replication. Three stem structures were chosen as targets for the introduction of transversion mutations designed to destroy base pairing structures. Mutations predicted to destroy the base pairing of nucleotides 142 to 136 with nucleotides 68 to 74 exhibited a deleterious effect on DIssE replication. Destruction of base pairing between positions 96 to 99 and 116 to 113 also decreased DI RNA replication. Mutations interfering with the pairing of nucleotides 67 to 63 with nucleotides 52 to 56 had only minor effects on DIssE replication. The introduction of second complementary mutations which restored the predicted base pairing of positions 142 to 136 with 68 to 74 and nucleotides 96 to 99 with 116 to 113 largely ameliorated defects in replication ability, restoring DI RNA replication to levels comparable to that of wild-type DIssE RNA, suggesting that these secondary structures are important for efficient MHV replication. We also identified a conserved 23-nucleotide stem-loop structure involving nucleotides 142 to 132 and nucleotides 68 to 79. The upstream side of this conserved stem-loop is contained within a host protein binding element (nucleotides 166 to 129).</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            <jats:italic>Nodaviridae</jats:italic>
            that suppress cellular RNA interference. The B2 proteins of insect alphanodaviruses block RNA interference by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thus preventing Dicer-mediated cleavage and the subsequent generation of short interfering RNAs. We show here that the fish betanodavirus B2 protein also binds dsRNA. Binding is sequence independent, and maximal binding occurs with dsRNA substrates greater than 20 bp in length. The binding of B2 to long dsRNA is sufficient to completely block Dicer cleavage of dsRNA in vitro. Protein-protein interaction studies indicated that B2 interacts with itself and with other dsRNA binding proteins, the interaction occurring through binding to shared dsRNA substrates. Induction of the dsRNA-dependent interferon response was not antagonized by B2, as the interferon-responsive

            instead relied solely on viral RNA1 accumulation, which is impaired in the B2 mutant. Hyperediting of virus dsRNA and site-specific editing of 5-HT2C mRNA were both antagonized by B2. RNA editing was not, however, observed in transfected wild-type or B2 mutant RNA1, suggesting that this pathway does not contribute to the RNA1 accumulation defect of the B2 mutant. We thus conclude that betanodavirus B2 is a dsRNA binding protein that sequesters and protects both long and short dsRNAs to protect betanodavirus from cellular RNA interference.

          <jats:p>Localization of VP40 in Marburg virus (MBGV)-infected cells was studied by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analysis. VP40 was detected in association with nucleocapsid structures, present in viral inclusions and at sites of virus budding. Additionally, VP40 was identified in the foci of virus-induced membrane proliferation and in intracellular membrane clusters which had the appearance of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). VP40-containing MVBs were free of nucleocapsids. When analyzed by immunogold labeling, the concentration of VP40 in MVBs was six times higher than in nucleocapsid structures. Biochemical studies showed that recombinant VP40 represented a peripheral membrane protein that was stably associated with membranes by hydrophobic interaction. Recombinant VP40 was also found in association with membranes of MVBs and in filopodia- or lamellipodia-like protrusions at the cell surface. Antibodies against marker proteins of various cellular compartments showed that VP40-positive membranes contained Lamp-1 and the transferrin receptor, confirming that they belong to the late endosomal compartment. VP40-positive membranes were also associated with actin. Western blot analysis of purified MBGV structural proteins demonstrated trace amounts of actin, Lamp-1, and Rab11 (markers of recycling endosomes), while markers for other cellular compartments were absent. Our data indicate that MBGV VP40 was able to interact with membranes of late endosomes in the course of viral infection.

Additionally, RAF-2p48 was independently identified as an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-interacting protein, NPI-5, in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mammalian cDNA library. In vitro, RAF-2p48 interacted with free NP but not with NP bound to RNA, and the RAF-2p48–NP complex was dissociated following addition of free RNA. Furthermore, RAF-2p48 facilitated formation of the NP-RNA complexes that likely serve as templates for the viral RNA polymerase. RAF-2p48 was shown, in both in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, to bind to the amino-terminal region of NP, a domain essential for RNA binding. Together, these observations suggest that RAF-2p48 facilitates NP-RNA interaction, thus leading to enhanced influenza virus RNA synthesis.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been further reported that the E4orf4 apoptotic pathway is caspase-independent in CHO cells. Here, we show that E4orf4 induces caspase activation in the human cell lines H1299 and 293T. Caspase activation is required for apoptosis in 293T cells, but not in H1299 cells. Dominant negative mutants of caspase-8 and the death receptor adapter protein FADD/MORT1 inhibit E4orf4-induced apoptosis in 293T cells, suggesting that E4orf4 activates the death receptor pathway.

            is released into the cytosol in E4orf4-expressing cells, but caspase-9 is not required for induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, E4orf4 induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a caspase-8- and FADD/MORT1-dependent manner, and inhibition of ROS generation by 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron) inhibits E4orf4-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results demonstrate that E4orf4 engages the death receptor pathway to generate at least part of the molecular events required for E4orf4-induced apoptosis.

We previously found a binding site of transcription factor Yin and Yang 1 (YY1) in one terminal region of the double-stranded linear replicative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (M. Nakanishi-Matsui, Y.

In this study, we established an HBV-producing system in which the cccDNA appeared to be generated from the transfected linear DNA or the linear replicative DNA by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by both NHEJ and homologous recombination between terminally repeated sequences, respectively. When the YY1-binding site in the terminal region of transfected linear viral DNA was mutated, the cccDNA was generated merely by NHEJ.

            Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) is an important equine and human pathogen of the Americas. In the adult mouse model, cDNA-derived, virulent V3000 inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) causes high-titer peripheral replication followed by neuroinvasion and lethal encephalitis. A single change (G to A) at nucleotide 3 (nt 3) of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the V3000 genome resulted in a virus (V3043) that was avirulent in mice. The mechanism of attenuation by the V3043 mutation was studied in vivo and in vitro. Kinetic studies of virus spread in adult mice following s.c. inoculation showed that V3043 replication was reduced in peripheral organs compared to that of V3000, titers in serum also were lower, and V3043 was cleared more rapidly from the periphery than V3000. Because clearance of V3043 from serum began 1 to 2 days prior to clearance of V3000, we examined the involvement of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) activity in VEE pathogenesis. In IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the course of the wild-type disease was extremely rapid, with all animals dying within 48 h (average survival time of 30 h compared to 7.7 days in the wild-type mice). The mutant V3043 was as virulent as the wild type (100% mortality, average survival time of 30 h). Virus titers in serum, peripheral organs, and the brain were similar in V3000- and V3043-infected IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice at all time points up until the death of the animals. Consistent with the in vivo data, the mutant virus exhibited reduced growth in vitro in several cell types except in cells that lacked a functional IFN-α/β pathway. In cells derived from IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the mutant virus showed no growth disadvantage compared to the wild-type virus, suggesting that IFN-α/β plays a major role in the attenuation of V3043 compared to V3000. There were no differences in the induction of IFN-α/β between V3000 and V3043, but the mutant virus was more sensitive than V3000 to the antiviral actions of IFN-α/β in two separate in vitro assays, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to IFN-α/β plays a major role in the in vivo attenuation of V3043.

In contrast to the rest of the parvoviruses, the VP1u of B19 is thought to occupy an external position in the virion, making this region a promising candidate for vaccine development. By using a monoclonal antibody against the most-N-terminal portion of VP1u, we revealed that this region rich in neutralizing epitopes is not accessible in native capsids. However, exposure of capsids to increasing temperatures or low pH led to its progressive accessibility without particle disassembly. Although unable to bind free virus or to block virus attachment to the cell, the anti-VP1u antibody was neutralizing, suggesting that the exposure of the epitope and the subsequent virus neutralization occur only after receptor attachment.

            The processivity subunit of the herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase, UL42, is essential for viral replication and possesses both Pol- and DNA-binding activities. Previous studies demonstrated that the substitution of alanine for each of four arginine residues, which reside on the positively charged surface of UL42, resulted in decreased DNA binding affinity and a decreased ability to synthesize long-chain DNA by the polymerase. In this study, the effects of each substitution on the production of viral progeny, viral DNA replication, and DNA replication fidelity were examined. Each substitution mutant was able to complement the replication of a

          <jats:p>Studies of the complete hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle have become possible with the development of an infectious cell culture system using the genotype 2a isolate JFH-1. Taking advantage of this system in the present study, we investigated whether HCV infection leads to superinfection exclusion, a state in which HCV-infected cells are resistant to secondary HCV infection. To discriminate between viral genomes, we inserted genes encoding fluorescent proteins in frame into the 3′-terminal NS5A coding region. These genomes replicated to wild-type levels and supported the production of infectious virus particles. Upon simultaneous infection of Huh-7 cells, coreplication of both viral genomes in the same cell was detected. However, when infections were performed sequentially, secondary infection was severely impaired. This superinfection exclusion was neither due to a reduction of cell surface expression of CD81 and scavenger receptor BI, two molecules implicated in HCV entry, nor due to a functional block at the level of virus entry. Instead, superinfection exclusion was mediated primarily by interference at the level of HCV RNA translation and, presumably, also replication. In summary, our results describe the construction and characterization of viable monocistronic HCV reporter genomes allowing detection of viral replication in infected living cells. By using these genomes, we found that HCV induces superinfection exclusion, which is primarily due to interference at a postentry step.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>The replication and pathogenicity of influenza A virus (FLUAV) are controlled in part by the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) system. This virus-host interplay is dependent on the production of IFN-α/β and on the capacity of the viral nonstructural protein NS1 to counteract the IFN system. Two different mechanisms have been described for NS1, namely, blocking the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and blocking posttranscriptional processing of cellular mRNAs. Here we directly compare the abilities of NS1 gene products from three different human FLUAV (H1N1) strains to counteract the antiviral host response. We found that A/PR/8/34 NS1 has a strong capacity to inhibit IRF3 and activation of the IFN-β promoter but is unable to suppress expression of other cellular genes. In contrast, the NS1 proteins of A/Tx/36/91 and of A/BM/1/18, the virus that caused the Spanish influenza pandemic, caused suppression of additional cellular gene expression. Thus, these NS1 proteins prevented the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral state, allowing virus replication even in the presence of IFN. Interestingly, the block in gene expression was dependent on a newly described NS1 domain that is important for interaction with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) component of the cellular pre-mRNA processing machinery but is not functional in A/PR/8/34 NS1. We identified the Phe-103 and Met-106 residues in NS1 as being critical for CPSF binding, together with the previously described C-terminal binding domain. Our results demonstrate the capacity of FLUAV NS1 to suppress the antiviral host defense at multiple levels and the existence of strain-specific differences that may modulate virus pathogenicity.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Originally identified in a variety of organisms ranging from plants to mammals, miRNAs have recently been identified in several viruses. Viral miRNAs may play a role in modulating both viral and host gene expression. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of 18 viral miRNAs from mouse fibroblasts lytically infected with the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The MCMV miRNAs are expressed at early times of infection and are scattered in small clusters throughout the genome with up to four distinct miRNAs processed from a single transcript. No significant homologies to human CMV-encoded miRNAs were found. Remarkably, as soon as 24 h after infection, MCMV miRNAs constituted about 35% of the total miRNA pool, and at 72 h postinfection, this proportion was increased to more than 60%. However, despite the abundance of viral miRNAs during the early phase of infection, the expression of some MCMV miRNAs appeared to be regulated. Hence, for three miRNAs we observed polyuridylation of their 3′ end, coupled to subsequent degradation. Individual knockout mutants of two of the most abundant MCMV miRNAs, miR-m01-4 and miR-M44-1, or a double knockout mutant of miR-m21-1 and miR-M23-2, incurred no or only a very mild growth deficit in murine embryonic fibroblasts in vitro.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>Nearly a third of the human population is at risk of infection with the four serotypes of dengue viruses, and it is estimated that more than 100 million infections occur each year. A licensed vaccine for dengue viruses has become a global health priority. A major challenge to developing a dengue vaccine is the necessity to produce fairly uniform protective immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes. We have developed two bivalent dengue virus vaccines, using a complex adenovirus vector, by incorporating the genes expressing premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of dengue virus types 1 and 2 (dengue-1 and -2, respectively) (CAdVax-Den12) or dengue-3 and -4 (CAdVax-Den34). Rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular inoculation of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulated by combining the two bivalent vaccine constructs. Vaccinated animals produced high-titer antibodies that neutralized all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. The ability of the vaccine to induce rapid, as well as sustained, protective immune responses was examined with two separate live-virus challenges administered at 4 and 24 weeks after the final vaccination. For both of these virus challenge studies, significant protection from viremia was demonstrated for all four dengue virus serotypes in vaccinated animals. Viremia from dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges was completely blocked, whereas viremia from dengue-2 and dengue-4 was significantly reduced, as well as delayed, compared to that of control-vaccinated animals. These results demonstrate that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four dengue virus serotypes.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            XXC, in the C-terminal domain SU. Here we have tested whether this motif is used for isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide of Env and whether this rearrangement is required for membrane fusion. We introduced the C225A and C228A mutations into Env and found that the former but not the latter mutant matured into covalently linked SU-TM complexes in transfected cells. Next, we constructed a secreted Env ectodomain and showed that it underwent incubation-dependent intersubunit disulfide isomerization on target cells. However, the rearrangement was blocked by the C225A mutation, suggesting that C
            <jats:sub>225</jats:sub>
            carried the isomerization-active thiol. Still, it was possible to reduce the intersubunit disulfide of the native C225A ectodomain mutant with dithiothreitol (DTT). The importance of the CXXC-mediated disulfide isomerization for infection was studied using murine leukemia virus vectors pseudotyped with wild-type or C225A HTLV-1 Env. We found that the mutant Env blocked infection, but this could be rescued with DTT. The fusion activity was tested in a fusion-from-within assay using a coculture of rat XC target and transfected BHK-21 effector cells. We found that the mutation blocked polykaryon formation, but this could be reversed with DTT. Similar DTT-reversible inhibition of infection and fusion was observed when a membrane-impermeable alkylator was present during the infection/fusion incubation. We conclude that the fusion activity of HTLV-1 Env is controlled by an SU CXXC-mediated isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide. Thus, this extends the applicability of the isomerization model from gammaretroviruses to deltaretroviruses.

            The measles virus (MV) accessory proteins V and C play important roles in MV replication and pathogenesis. Infection with recombinant MV lacking either V or C causes more cell death than infection with the parental vaccine-equivalent virus (MVvac), and C-deficient virus grows poorly relative to the parental virus. Here, we show that a major effector of the C phenotype is the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Using human HeLa cells stably deficient in PKR as a result of RNA interference-mediated knockdown (PKR

Furthermore, the results establish that a principal function of the MV C protein is to antagonize the proapoptotic and antiviral activities of PKR.

            -Golgi network membranes. This process is facilitated by interactions among the carboxyl termini of viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins. To directly investigate the relative importance of the carboxyl terminus of glycoprotein D (gD) in the presence or absence of gE, a recombinant virus (gDΔct) was constructed to specify a truncated gD lacking the carboxy-terminal 29 amino acids. Furthermore, two additional recombinant viruses were constructed by mutating from ATG to CTG the initiation codons of gE (gEctg) or both gE and gM (gEctg+gMctg), causing lack of expression of gE or both gE and gM, respectively. A fourth mutant virus was constructed to specify the gEctg+gDΔct mutations. The replication properties of these viruses were compared to those of a newly constructed recombinant virus unable to express UL20 due to alteration of the two initiation codons of UL20 (UL20ctgctg). All recombinant viruses were constructed by using the double-Red, site-directed mutagenesis system implemented on the HSV-1(F) genome cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. The gEctg, gEctg+gMctg, gDΔct, and gEctg+gDΔct viruses produced viral plaques on African monkey kidney cells (Vero), as well as other cells, that were on average approximately 30 to 50% smaller than those produced by the wild-type virus HSV-1(F). In contrast, the UL20ctgctg virus produced very small plaques containing three to five cells, as reported previously for the ΔUL20 virus lacking the entire UL20 gene. Viral replication kinetics of intracellular and extracellular viruses revealed that all recombinant viruses produced viral titers similar to those produced by the wild-type HSV-1(F) virus intracellularly and extracellularly at late times postinfection, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which replicated more than two-and-a-half logs less efficiently than HSV-1(F). Electron microscopy confirmed that all viruses, regardless of their different gene mutations, efficiently produced enveloped virions within infected cells, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which accumulated high levels of unenveloped virions in the cytoplasm. These results show that the carboxyl terminus of gD and the full-length gE, either alone or in a redundant manner, are not essential in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and egress from infected cells. Similarly, gM and gE do not function alone or in a redundant manner in cytoplasmic envelopment and virion egress, confirming previous findings.

Transduction profiles for each of these cell lines were generated, and a significant positive correlation was observed between RhoC expression and permissivity for EBOV vector transduction. This correlation was not specific for EBOV vector alone as RhoC also correlated highly with transduction of vesicular stomatitis virus GP (VSVG) pseudotyped vector. Levels of RhoC protein in EBOV and VSV permissive and nonpermissive cells were consistent with the cDNA gene array findings. Additionally, vector transduction was elevated in cells that expressed high levels of endogenous RhoC but not RhoA. RhoB and RhoC overexpression significantly increased EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped vector transduction but had minimal effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) GP pseudotyped HIV or adeno-associated virus 2 vector entry, indicating that not all virus uptake was enhanced by expression of these molecules. RhoB and RhoC overexpression also significantly enhanced VSV infection. Similarly, overexpression of RhoC led to a significant increase in fusion of EBOV virus-like particles. Finally, ectopic expression of RhoC resulted in increased nonspecific endocytosis of fluorescent dextran and in formation of increased actin stress fibers compared to RhoA-transfected cells, suggesting that RhoC is enhancing macropinocytosis. In total, our studies implicate RhoB and RhoC in enhanced productive entry of some pseudovirions and suggest the involvement of actin-mediated macropinocytosis as a mechanism of uptake of EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped viral particles.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>
            Insulin degradation enzyme (IDE) is a 110-kDa zinc metalloprotease found in the cytosol of all cells. IDE degrades insulin and a variety of small proteins including amyloid-β. Recently, IDE has been proposed as the receptor for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) attachment. During our reassessment, some of the original studies were repeated and expanded in scope. We first confirmed that IDE antibody reduced VZV spread. For additional controls, we repeated the same experiments with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells as well as uninfected cells. There was a visible reduction in HSV spread but less than seen in the VZV system. Of greater importance, IDE antibody also inhibited the growth of uninfected cells. Second, we repeated the coprecipitation assays. We confirmed that antibodies to VZV gE (open reading frame 68) coprecipitated IDE and that anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated gE. However, the detected gE protein was not the mature 98-kDa form; rather, it was a precursor 73-kDa gE form found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional control experiments included VZV-infected cell cultures treated with tunicamycin to block gE glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum; again, the anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated a 73-kDa gE product. Finally, Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis of a chromatographically purified gE sample revealed four cellular proteins associated with the unfolded protein response: BiP (HSPA5), HSPA8, HSPD1, and PPIA (peptidyl-propyl

            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            isomerase). We conclude that IDE protease binds to the 73-kDa gE precursor and that this event occurs in the cytosol but not as a receptor/ligand interaction.

          <jats:p>Central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) takes three clinical forms: meningitis (TBM), intracranial tuberculoma, and spinal arachnoiditis. TBM predominates in the western world and presents as a subacute to chronic meningitis syndrome with a prodrome of malaise, fever, and headache progressing to altered mentation and focal neurologic signs, followed by stupor, coma, and death within five to eight weeks of onset. The CSF formula typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and low glucose and high protein concentrations. Diagnosis rests on serial samples of CSF for smear and culture, combined with CSF PCR. Brain CT and MRI aid in diagnosis, assessment for complications, and monitoring of the clinical course. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of TBM. Vasculitis leading to infarcts in the basal ganglia occurs commonly and is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Treatment is most effective when started in the early stages of disease, and should be initiated promptly on the basis of strong clinical suspicion without waiting for laboratory confirmation. The initial 4 drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) covers the possibility of infection with a resistant strain, maximizes antimicrobial impact, and reduces the likelihood of emerging resistance on therapy.

          <jats:p>In HIV-infected individuals, paradoxical reactions after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with a variety of underlying infections and have been called the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In cases of IRIS associated with tuberculosis (TB), two distinct patterns of disease are recognized: (i) the progression of subclinical TB to clinical disease after the initiation of ART, referred to as unmasking, and (ii) the progression or appearance of new clinical and/or radiographic disease in patients with previously recognized TB after the initiation of ART, the classic or “paradoxical” TB-IRIS. IRIS can potentially occur in all granulomatous diseases, not just infectious ones. All granulomatous diseases are thought to result from interplay of inflammatory cells and mediators. One of the inflammatory cells thought to be integral to the development of the granuloma is the CD4 T lymphocyte. Therefore, HIV-infected patients with noninfectious granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis may also develop IRIS reactions. Here, we describe IRIS in HIV-infected patients with TB and sarcoidosis and review the basic clinical and immunological aspects of these phenomena.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            . RNAs of this class selectively bind a specific cognate tRNA, utilizing recognition of the tRNA anticodon and other tRNA features. The riboswitch monitors the aminoacylation status of the tRNA to induce expression of the regulated downstream gene(s) at the level of transcription antitermination or derepression of translation initiation in response to reduced tRNA charging via stabilization of an antiterminator or antisequestrator. Recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed new features of tRNA recognition that extend beyond the initially identified Watson-Crick base-pairing of a codon-like sequence in the riboswitch with the tRNA anticodon, and residues in the antiterminator or antisequestrator with the tRNA acceptor end. These studies have revealed new tRNA contacts and new modes of riboswitch function and ligand recognition that expand our understanding of RNA-RNA recognition and the biological roles of tRNA.

            Several pathogens have evolved to infect host cells from within, which requires subversion of many host intracellular processes. In the case of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, adaptation to an intracellular life cycle relies largely on the activity of type III secretion systems (T3SSs), an apparatus used to deliver effector proteins into the host cell, from where these effectors regulate important cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton reorganization, and the innate immune response. Each bacterium is equipped with a unique suite of these T3SS effectors, which aid in the development of an individual intracellular lifestyle for their respective pathogens. Some bacteria adapt to reside and propagate within a customized vacuole, while others establish a replicative niche in the host cytosol. In this article, we review the mechanisms by which T3SS effectors contribute to these different lifestyles. To illustrate the formation of a vacuolar and a cytosolic lifestyle, we discuss the intracellular habitats of the enteric pathogens

          <jats:p>In addition to SecA of the general Sec system, many Gram-positive bacteria, including mycobacteria, express SecA2, a second, transport-associated ATPase. SecA2s can be subdivided into two mechanistically distinct types: (i) SecA2s that are part of the accessory Sec (aSec) system, a specialized transporter mediating the export of a family of serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins that function as adhesins, and (ii) SecA2s that are part of multisubstrate systems, in which SecA2 interacts with components of the general Sec system, specifically the SecYEG channel, to export multiple types of substrates. Found mainly in streptococci and staphylococci, the aSec system also contains SecY2 and novel accessory Sec proteins (Asps) that are required for optimal export. Asp2 also acetylates glucosamine residues on the SRR domains of the substrate during transport. Targeting of the SRR substrate to SecA2 and the aSec translocon is mediated by a specialized signal peptide. Multisubstrate SecA2 systems are present in mycobacteria, corynebacteria, listeriae, clostridia, and some bacillus species. Although most substrates for this SecA2 have canonical signal peptides that are required for export, targeting to SecA2 appears to depend on structural features of the mature protein. The feature of the mature domains of these proteins that renders them dependent on SecA2 for export may be their potential to fold in the cytoplasm. The discovery of aSec and multisubstrate SecA2 systems expands our appreciation of the diversity of bacterial export pathways. Here we present our current understanding of the mechanisms of each of these SecA2 systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Malaria is a vector-borne disease that involves multiple parasite species in a variety of ecological settings. However, the parasite species causing the disease, the prevalence of subclinical infections, the emergence of drug resistance, the scale-up of interventions, and the ecological factors affecting malaria transmission, among others, are aspects that vary across areas where malaria is endemic. Such complexities have propelled the study of parasite genetic diversity patterns in the context of epidemiologic investigations. Importantly, molecular studies indicate that the time and spatial distribution of malaria cases reflect epidemiologic processes that cannot be fully understood without characterizing the evolutionary forces shaping parasite population genetic patterns. Although broad in scope, this review in the

            Discontinuity of both strands of the chromosome is a lethal event in all living organisms because it compromises chromosome replication. As such, a diversity of DNA repair systems has evolved to repair double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In part, this diversity of DSB repair systems has evolved to repair breaks that arise in diverse physiologic circumstances or sequence contexts, including cellular states of nonreplication or breaks that arise between repeats. Mycobacteria elaborate a set of three genetically distinct DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining, and single-strand annealing. As such, mycobacterial DSB repair diverges substantially from the standard model of prokaryotic DSB repair and represents an attractive new model system. In addition, the presence in mycobacteria of a DSB repair system that can repair DSBs in nonreplicating cells (nonhomologous end joining) or when DSBs arise between repeats (single-strand annealing) has clear potential relevance to

          <jats:p>Although most of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are incorporated in the host genome almost randomly, some non-LTR retrotransposons are incorporated into specific sequences within a target site. On the basis of structural and phylogenetic features, non-LTR retrotransposons are classified into two large groups, restriction enzyme-like endonuclease (RLE)-encoding elements and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)-encoding elements. All clades of RLE-encoding non-LTR retrotransposons include site-specific elements. However, only two of more than 20 APE-encoding clades, Tx1 and R1, contain site-specific non-LTR elements. Site-specific non-LTR retrotransposons usually target within multi-copy RNA genes, such as rRNA gene (rDNA) clusters, or repetitive genomic sequences, such as telomeric repeats; this behavior may be a symbiotic strategy to reduce the damage to the host genome. Site- and sequence-specificity are variable even among closely related non-LTR elements and appeared to have changed during evolution. In the APE-encoding elements, the primary determinant of the sequence- specific integration is APE itself, which nicks one strand of the target DNA during the initiation of target primed reverse transcription (TPRT). However, other factors, such as interaction between mRNA and the target DNA, and access to the target region in the nuclei also affect the sequence-specificity. In contrast, in the RLE-encoding elements, DNA-binding motifs appear to affect their sequence-specificity, rather than the RLE domain itself. Highly specific integration properties of these site-specific non-LTR elements make them ideal alternative tools for sequence-specific gene delivery, particularly for therapeutic purposes in human diseases.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>Plasmids confer genetic information that benefits the bacterial cells containing them. In pathogenic bacteria, plasmids often harbor virulence determinants that enhance the pathogenicity of the bacterium. The ability to acquire iron in environments where it is limited, for instance the eukaryotic host, is a critical factor for bacterial growth. To acquire iron, bacteria have evolved specific iron uptake mechanisms. These systems are often chromosomally encoded, while those that are plasmid-encoded are rare. Two main plasmid types, ColV and pJM1, have been shown to harbor determinants that increase virulence by providing the cell with essential iron for growth. It is clear that these two plasmid groups evolved independently from each other since they do not share similarities either in the plasmid backbones or in the iron uptake systems they harbor. The siderophores aerobactin and salmochelin that are found on ColV plasmids fall in the hydroxamate and catechol group, respectively, whereas both functional groups are present in the anguibactin siderophore, the only iron uptake system found on pJM1-type plasmids. Besides siderophore-mediated iron uptake, ColV plasmids carry additional genes involved in iron metabolism. These systems include ABC transporters, hemolysins, and a hemoglobin protease. ColV- and pJM1-like plasmids have been shown to confer virulence to their bacterial host, and this trait can be completely ascribed to their encoded iron uptake systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bacterial defenses against these physical and chemical stresses are pivotal for successful host colonization and pathogenesis.

          <jats:p>Although long recognized as a human pathogen, West Nile virus (WNV) emerged as a significant public health problem following its introduction and spread across North America. Subsequent years have seen a greater understanding of all aspects of this viral infection. The North American epidemic resulted in a further understanding of the virology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and epidemiology of WNV infection. Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic people experience an acute systemic febrile illness; less than 1% of infected people develop neuroinvasive disease, which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or anterior myelitis resulting in acute flaccid paralysis. Older age is associated with more severe illness and higher mortality; other risk factors for poor outcome have been challenging to identify. In addition to natural infection through mosquito bites, transfusion- and organ transplant–associated infections have occurred. Since there is no definitive treatment for WNV infection, protection from mosquito bites and other preventative measures are critical. WNV has reached an endemic pattern in North America, but the future epidemiologic pattern is uncertain.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            To survive adverse conditions, some bacterial species are capable of developing into a cell type, the “spore,” which exhibits minimal metabolic activity and remains viable in the presence of multiple environmental challenges. For some pathogenic bacteria, this developmental state serves as a means of survival during transmission from one host to another. Spores are the highly infectious form of these bacteria. Upon entrance into a host, specific signals facilitate germination into metabolically active replicating organisms, resulting in disease pathogenesis.

          <jats:p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most deadly bacterial infectious disease worldwide. Its treatment and control are threatened by increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or nearly untreatable extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. New concepts are therefore urgently needed to understand the factors driving the TB epidemics and the spread of different strain populations, especially in association with drug resistance. Classical genotyping and, more recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the world population of tubercle bacilli is more diverse than previously thought. Several major phylogenetic lineages can be distinguished, which are associated with their sympatric host population. Distinct clonal (sub)populations can even coexist within infected patients. WGS is now used as the ultimate approach for differentiating clinical isolates and for linking phenotypic to genomic variation from lineage to strain levels. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the genetic diversity of TB strains translates into pathobiological consequences, and key molecular mechanisms probably involved in differential pathoadaptation of some main lineages have recently been identified.

          <jats:p>The modulation of tuberculosis (TB)-induced immunopathology caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coinfection remains incompletely understood but underlies the change seen in the natural history, presentation, and prognosis of TB in such patients. The deleterious combination of these two pathogens has been dubbed a “deadly syndemic,” with each favoring the replication of the other and thereby contributing to accelerated disease morbidity and mortality. HIV-1 is the best-recognized risk factor for the development of active TB and accounts for 13% of cases globally. The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has considerably mitigated this risk. Rapid roll-out of ART globally and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate ART for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count should lead to further reductions in HIV-1-associated TB incidence because susceptibility to TB is inversely proportional to CD4 count. However, it is important to note that even after successful ART, patients with HIV-1 are still at increased risk for TB. Indeed, in settings of high TB incidence, the occurrence of TB often remains the first presentation of, and thereby the entry into, HIV care. As advantageous as ART-induced immune recovery is, it may also give rise to immunopathology, especially in the lower-CD4-count strata in the form of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome will continue to impact the HIV-TB syndemic.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

          <jats:p>Urogenital tuberculosis is the second most frequent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Starting with a pulmonary focus, 2 to 20% of patients develop urogenital tuberculosis through hematogenous spread to the kidneys, prostate, and epididymis; through the descending collecting system to the ureters, bladder, and urethra; and through the ejaculatory ducts to the genital organs. Urogenital tuberculosis occurs at all age ranges, but it is predominant in males in their fourth and fifth decades. It is a serious, insidious disease, generally developing symptoms only at a late stage, which leads to a diagnostic delay with consequent urogenital organ destruction; there are reports of patients with renal failure as their initial clinical presentation. Although the condition has been long recognized by nephrologists, urologists, and infectious disease specialists, urogenital tuberculosis is still largely unknown. Even when suggestive findings such as hematuria, sterile pyuria, and recurrent urinary infections are present, we rarely remember this diagnostic possibility. Greater knowledge of the features of urogenital tuberculosis then becomes relevant and should emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Endocrine and metabolic derangements are infrequent in patients with tuberculosis, but they are important when they occur. The basis for these abnormalities is complex. While
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            has been described to infect virtually every endocrine gland, the incidence of gland involvement is low, especially in the era of effective antituberculosis therapy. Furthermore, endocrine and metabolic abnormalities do not always reflect direct infection of the gland but may result from physiological response or as a consequence of therapy. Metabolic disease may also predispose patients to the development of active tuberculosis, particularly in the case of diabetes mellitus. While hormonal therapy may be necessary in some instances, frequently these endocrine complications do not require specific interventions other than antituberculous therapy itself. With the exception of diabetes mellitus, which will be covered elsewhere, this chapter reviews the endocrinologic and metabolic issues related to tuberculosis.

          <jats:p>The molecular composition of the cell wall is critical for the biology and ecology of each fungal species. Fungal walls are composed of matrix components that are embedded and linked to scaffolds of fibrous load-bearing polysaccharides. Most of the major cell wall components of fungal pathogens are not represented in humans, other mammals, or plants, and therefore the immune systems of animals and plants have evolved to recognize many of the conserved elements of fungal walls. For similar reasons the enzymes that assemble fungal cell wall components are excellent targets for antifungal chemotherapies and fungicides. However, for fungal pathogens, the cell wall is often disguised since key signature molecules for immune recognition are sometimes masked by immunologically inert molecules. Cell wall damage leads to the activation of sophisticated fail-safe mechanisms that shore up and repair walls to avoid catastrophic breaching of the integrity of the surface. The frontiers of research on fungal cell walls are moving from a descriptive phase defining the underlying genes and component parts of fungal walls to more dynamic analyses of how the various components are assembled, cross-linked, and modified in response to environmental signals. This review therefore discusses recent advances in research investigating the composition, synthesis, and regulation of cell walls and how the cell wall is targeted by immune recognition systems and the design of antifungal diagnostics and therapeutics.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Influenza A virus (IAV) RNA segments are individually packaged with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA polymerases to form a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. We previously reported that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein which can be deubiquitinated by a cellular ubiquitin protease, USP11. In this study, we identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4 (Ccr4-Not transcription complex subunit 4), which can ubiquitinate NP. We found that the levels of viral RNA, protein, viral particles, and RNA polymerase activity in CNOT4 knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells upon IAV infection. Conversely, overexpression of CNOT4 rescued viral RNP activity. In addition, CNOT4 interacted with the NP in the cell. An

            -translated CNOT4, but ubiquitination did not affect the protein stability of NP. Significantly, CNOT4 increased NP ubiquitination, whereas USP11 decreased it. Mass spectrometry analysis of ubiquitinated NP revealed multiple ubiquitination sites on the various lysine residues of NP. Three of these, K184, K227, and K273, are located on the RNA-binding groove of NP. Mutations of these sites to arginine reduced viral RNA replication. These results indicate that CNOT4 is a ubiquitin ligase of NP, and ubiquitination of NP plays a positive role in viral RNA replication.

            Influenza virus, particularly influenza A virus, causes severe and frequent outbreaks among human and avian species. Finding potential target sites for antiviral agents is of utmost importance from the public health point of view. We previously found that viral nucleoprotein (NP) is ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination enhances viral RNA replication. In this study, we found a cellular ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4, capable of ubiquitinating NP. The ubiquitination sites are scattered on the surface of the NP molecule, which is critical for RNA replication. CNOT4 and a ubiquitin protease, USP11, together regulate the extent of NP ubiquitination and thereby the efficiency of RNA replication. This study thus identifies a potential antiviral target site and reveals a novel posttranslational mechanism for regulating viral replication. This represents a novel finding in the literature of influenza virus research.

These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells. We also discovered that liposoluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, overcome

            antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial lipocalins, providing an unexpected new alternative to combat resistance by using this vitamin or its derivatives as antibiotic adjuvants.

            membrane proteins that, in the absence of YidC, exhibited aberrant localization by microscopy. Further examination of a subset revealed biochemical defects in membrane insertion in the absence of YidC, indicating their dependence on YidC for proper membrane insertion or folding. Membrane proteins possessing an unfavorable distribution of positively charged residues were significantly more likely to depend on YidC for membrane insertion. Correcting the charge distribution of a charge-unbalanced YidC-dependent membrane protein abrogated its requirement for YidC, while perturbing the charge distribution of a charge-balanced YidC-independent membrane protein rendered it YidC dependent, demonstrating that charge distribution can be a necessary and sufficient determinant of YidC dependence. These findings provide insights into a mechanism by which YidC promotes proper membrane protein biogenesis and suggest a critical function of YidC in all organisms and organelles that express it.

            The anti-σ factor NepR plays a central role in regulation of the general stress response (GSR) in alphaproteobacteria. This small protein has two known interaction partners: its cognate extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor and the anti-anti-σ factor, PhyR. Stress-dependent phosphorylation of PhyR initiates a protein partner switch that promotes phospho-PhyR binding to NepR, which frees ECF σ to activate transcription of genes required for cell survival under adverse or fluctuating conditions. We have defined key functional roles for structured and intrinsically disordered domains of

            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and that this effect requires the structured and disordered domains of NepR. This result provides evidence for an additional layer of GSR regulation in which NepR directly influences activation of its binding partner, PhyR, as an anti-anti-σ factor. We conclude that structured and intrinsically disordered domains of NepR coordinately control multiple functions in the GSR signaling pathway, including core protein partner switch interactions and pathway activation by phosphorylation.

            Anti-σ factors are key molecular participants in a range of adaptive responses in bacteria. The anti-σ factor NepR plays a vital role in a multiprotein partner switch that governs general stress response (GSR) transcription in alphaproteobacteria. We have defined conserved and unconserved features of NepR structure that determine its function as an anti-σ factor and uncovered a functional role for intrinsically disordered regions of NepR in partner binding events required for GSR activation. We further demonstrate a novel function for NepR as an enhancer of PhyR phosphorylation; this activity also requires the disordered domains of NepR. Our results provide evidence for a new layer of GSR regulatory control in which NepR directly modulates PhyR phosphorylation and, hence, activation of the GSR.

Multiple pathways, including the conserved cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling and GlcNAc catabolic pathways, are involved in GICD. GlcNAc acts as a signaling molecule to regulate multiple cellular programs in a coordinated manner and therefore maximizes the efficiency of nutrient use. This adaptive behavior allows

            Despite significant advances in health care, outbreaks of infections by enteroviruses (EVs) continue to plague the Asia-Pacific region every year. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), for which there are currently no therapeutics. Here, we report two new antibodies, A9 and D6, that potently neutralize EV71. A9 exhibited a 50% neutralizing concentration (neut

            ) value of 0.1 nM against EV71, which was 10-fold lower than that observed for D6. Investigation into the mechanisms of neutralization revealed that binding of A9 to EV71 blocks receptor binding but also destabilizes and damages the virus capsid structure. In contrast, D6 destabilizes the capsid only slightly but interferes more potently with the attachment of the virus to the host cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of A9 and D6 bound with EV71 shed light on the locations and nature of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies. Although some regions of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies overlap, there are differences that give rise to dissimilarities in potency as well as in the mechanisms of neutralization. Interestingly, the overlapping regions of the epitopes encompass the site that the virus uses to bind SCARB2, explaining the reason for the observed blocking of the virus-receptor interaction by the two antibodies. We also identified structural elements that might play roles in modulating the stability of the EV71 particles, including particle integrity. The molecular features of the A9 and D6 epitopes unveiled in this study open up new avenues for rationally designing antiviral drugs.

            During the course of viral infections, the human body produces neutralizing antibodies which play a defining role in clearing the virus. From this study, we report two new, highly potent neutralizing antibodies, A9 and D6, against enterovirus 71 (EV71), the causative agent of HFMD. Both antibodies prevent the virus from entering the host cell, a step that is important for establishing a successful infection. A9 destabilizes and damages the virus capsid that forms an outer protective covering around the genome of the virus, while also interfering with virus attachment to the host cells. In contrast, D6 only prevents binding of the virus to its receptor(s). The mechanism of neutralization of A9 is unique and has not been observed before for neutralizing antibodies targeting EVs. The two antibodies that we are reporting in this study have potential to be developed into much-needed therapeutic interventions for treatment of HFMD, outbreaks of which are reported every year in the Asia-Pacific region.

These observations led us to discover that cell surface localization and/or total levels of ergosterol correlate with the ability of

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Cryptococcus neoformans</jats:named-content>
            to trigger pyroptosis. Since the mammalian sterol cholesterol triggers NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, we hypothesized that ergosterol may also do so. Consistent with that hypothesis, ergosterol-containing liposomes but not ergosterol-free liposomes induce pyroptosis. Cell wall mannoproteins directly bind ergosterol, and we found that Dan1, an ergosterol receptor mannoprotein, as well as specific mannosyltransferases, is required for pyroptosis, suggesting that cell wall-associated ergosterol may mediate the process. Taken together, these data indicate that ergosterol, like mammalian cholesterol, plays a direct role in yeast-mediated pyroptosis.

            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            ; here, we show that pyroptosis occurs in the initial stages of murine kidney infection, suggesting that it plays an important role in the initial response of the innate immune system to invasive yeast infection. We also show that a key component of the fungal plasma membrane, ergosterol, directly triggers pyroptosis. Ergosterol is also present in the fungal cell wall, most likely associated with mannoproteins, and is increased in hyphal cells compared to yeast cells. Our data indicate that specific mannoproteins are required for pyroptosis. This is consistent with a potential mechanism whereby ergosterol present in the outer mannoprotein layer of the cell wall is accessible to the macrophage-mediated process. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that ergosterol plays a direct role in the host-pathogen interactions of fungi.

            causes many infections, such as skin and soft tissue, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an endovascular infection of native and prosthetic valves and the lining of the heart; it is characterized by the formation of cauliflower-like “vegetations” composed of fibrin, platelets, other host factors, bacteria, and bacterial products. β-Toxin is an
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            virulence factor that contributes to the microorganism’s ability to cause IE. This cytolysin has two enzymatic activities: sphingomyelinase (SMase) and biofilm ligase. Although both activities have functions in a rabbit model of IE, the mechanism(s) by which β-toxin directly affects human cells and is involved in the infectious process has not been elucidated. Here, we compared the
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            effects of purified recombinant wild-type β-toxin, SMase-deficient β-toxin (H289N), and biofilm ligase-deficient β-toxin (H162A and/or D163A) on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and platelets. β-Toxin was cytotoxic to HAECs and inhibited the production of interleukin 8 (IL-8) from these cells by both SMase and biofilm ligase activities. β-Toxin altered HAEC surface expression of CD40 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). HAECs treated with β-toxin displayed granular membrane morphology not seen in treatment with the SMase-deficient mutant. The altered morphology resulted in two possibly separable activities, cell rounding and redistribution of cell membranes into granules, which were not the result of endosome production from the Golgi apparatus or lysosomes. β-Toxin directly aggregated rabbit platelets via SMase activity.

Multiple clonal group strains as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, particularly USA200 and other clones encoding β-toxin, are highly associated with IE. Considering the strong association and established contribution of β-toxin in animal models of IE, determining how β-toxin directly affects human cell types, including endothelial cells and platelets, is important. In this study, we demonstrate that β-toxin functions to modulate endothelial cells and platelets by both toxin sphingomyelinase and biofilm ligase activities. Our data suggest that these activities modulate inflammation and increase infection severity.

To gain insights into the molecular basis of acute Lyme disease and the ensuing development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted a longitudinal transcriptome study of 29 Lyme disease patients (and 13 matched controls) enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for up to 6 months. The differential gene expression signature of Lyme disease following the acute phase of infection persisted for at least 3 weeks and had fewer than 44% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common with other infectious or noninfectious syndromes. Early Lyme disease prior to antibiotic therapy was characterized by marked upregulation of Toll-like receptor signaling but lack of activation of the inflammatory T-cell apoptotic and B-cell developmental pathways seen in other acute infectious syndromes. Six months after completion of therapy, Lyme disease patients were found to have 31 to 60% of their pathways in common with three different immune-mediated chronic diseases. No differential gene expression signature was observed between Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent symptoms at 6 months post-treatment. The identification of a sustained differential gene expression signature in Lyme disease suggests that a panel of selected human host-based biomarkers may address the need for sensitive clinical diagnostics during the “window period” of infection prior to the appearance of a detectable antibody response and may also inform the development of new therapeutic targets.

            Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States, and some patients report lingering symptoms lasting months to years despite antibiotic treatment. To better understand the role of the human host response in acute Lyme disease and the development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted the first longitudinal gene expression (transcriptome) study of patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed up for up to 6 months after treatment. Importantly, we found that the gene expression signature of early Lyme disease is distinct from that of other acute infectious diseases and persists for at least 3 weeks following infection. This study also uncovered multiple previously undescribed pathways and genes that may be useful in the future as human host biomarkers for diagnosis and that constitute potential targets for the development of new therapies.

            <jats:italic>T. gondii</jats:italic>
            ’s persistence in neurons holds the potential to identify novel, curative drug targets. The work presented here offers new insights into the neuron-

            Zinc is crucial for many biological processes, as it is an essential cofactor of enzymes and a structural component of regulatory and DNA binding proteins. Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export.

All the three new salmonid cathelicidin genes share the common characteristics of mammalian cathelicidin genes, such as consisting of four exons and possessing a highly conserved preproregion and four invariant cysteines clustered in the C-terminal region of the cathelin-like domain.

Salmonid cathelicidins possess the same elastase-sensitive residue, threonine, as hagfish cathelicidins and the rabbit CAP18 molecule. The cleavage site of the four salmonid cathelicidins is within a conserved amino acid motif of QKIRTRR, which is at the beginning of the sequence encoded by exon IV.

            (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) have become increasingly common. This study's objectives were to describe the clinical spectrum of MRSA in a community health center and to determine whether the use of specific antimicrobials correlated with increased probability of clinical resolution of SSTI. A retrospective chart review of 399 sequential cases of culture-confirmed
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            SSTI, including 227 cases of MRSA SSTI, among outpatients at Fenway Community Health (Boston, MA) from 1998 to 2005 was done. The proportion of
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            SSTI due to MRSA increased significantly from 1998 to 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). Resistance to clindamycin was common (48.2% of isolates). At the beginning of the study period, most patients with MRSA SSTI empirically treated with antibiotics received a beta-lactam, whereas by 2005, 76% received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). Initially, few MRSA isolates were sensitive to the empirical antibiotic, but 77% were susceptible by 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of patients with MRSA isolates had clinical resolution on the empirical antibiotic by 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.037). Use of an empirical antibiotic to which the clinical isolate was sensitive was associated with increased odds of clinical resolution on empirical therapy (odds ratio = 5.91), controlling for incision and drainage and HIV status. MRSA now accounts for the majority of SSTI due to
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            at Fenway, and improved rates of clinical resolution on empirical antibiotic therapy have paralleled increasing use of empirical TMP-SMX for these infections. TMP-SMX appears to be an appropriate empirical antibiotic for suspected MRSA SSTI, especially where clindamycin resistance is common.

By using N-terminal sequence and an internal protein sequence, a digoxigenin-labeled probe was made for nonradioactive hybridization, and a 2.5-kb gene fragment was obtained by colony hybridization of a cosmid library. Through Southern blotting and sequence analysis of the selected cosmid clone, the structural gene of the enzyme (1,335 bp) was identified, which encodes a protein of 47,244 Da with a theoretical pI of 6.2. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Œ≤-transaminase showed the highest sequence similarity with glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase of transaminase subgroup II.

The Œ≤-transaminase has an unusually broad specificity for amino acceptors such as pyruvate and Œ±-ketoglutarate/oxaloacetate. The enantioselectivity of the enzyme suggested that the recognition mode of Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids in the active site is reversed relative to that of Œ±-amino acids. After comparison of its primary structure with transaminase subgroup II enzymes, it was proposed that R43 interacts with the carboxylate group of the Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids and the carboxylate group on the side chain of dicarboxylic Œ±-keto acids such as Œ±-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate. R404 is another conserved residue, which interacts with the Œ±-carboxylate group of the Œ±-amino acids and Œ±-keto acids. The Œ≤-transaminase was used for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically pure Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids. (3

            The inclusion of high-quality hay (HQH), in place of concentrates, shifts dietary carbohydrate intake, and the extent to which these shifts effect epimural microbiota and epithelial gene expression of the rumen has not yet been evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 by 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments containing HQH, with either 0% concentrate/100% HQH (100HQH), 25% concentrate/75% HQH (75HQH), or 40% concentrate/60% HQH (60HQH). The fourth group (control [CON]) was fed 60% normal fiber-rich hay and 40% concentrate. The data showed that measures of diversity for the rumen epimural population, specifically the Shannon (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.004) and Simpson (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

            to
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Proteobacteria</jats:named-content>
            . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HQH feeding markedly shifted the abundance of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Campylobacter</jats:named-content>
            spp. from 7.8 up to 33.5% (

            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.65) in HQH diet being responsible for this shift. The expression of genes targeting intracellular pH regulation, barrier function, and nutrient uptake of rumen epithelium remained stable regardless of the carbohydrate source. In conclusion, the data suggest strong alterations of the ruminal epimural microbiota in response to changes in the nutritive patterns of the diet. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of these significant microbial changes on rumen health and food safety aspects in cattle at a transcriptional level.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Feeding of forages versus starchy concentrates is a highly debated topic. Hay is believed to be healthier and more ecological sustainable for cattle than are concentrates, although the effects of feeding hay with enhanced sugar and protein content on epimural microbiota and host gene expression have not yet been evaluated. This research provides a report of the role of feeding hay with increased sugar and protein content in place of starchy concentrates in altering epimural microbiota and in generating a host response. Our research shows that the addition of high-quality hay to dairy rations shifted nutrient intake, resulting in strong alterations in the epimural microbiota in cattle. This work provides a background for further long-term research regarding the effects of feeding practices on the host-microbiome interaction and its role in rumen health and food safety in cattle.

These pathogens utilize a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host epithelial cells, modulating diverse cellular functions, including the release of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). While studies have implicated the effectors NleE (non-locus of enterocyte effacement [LEE]-encoded effector E) and NleH1 in suppressing IL-8 release, by preventing NF-Œ∫B nuclear translocation, the impact of these effectors only partially replicates the immunosuppressive actions of wild-type EPEC, suggesting another effector or effectors are involved.

To explore the features of disease and the response to infection, we measured host gene expression in conjunctival samples from Gambian children with active trachoma and healthy controls. Genome-wide expression and transcription network analysis identified signatures characteristic of the expected infiltrating immune cell populations, such as neutrophils and T/B lymphocytes. The expression signatures were also significantly enriched for genes in pathways which regulate NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, antigen processing and presentation, chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. The data suggest that in addition to polymorph and adaptive cellular responses, NK cells may contribute to a significant component of the conjunctival inflammatory response to chlamydial infection.

            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>
            macrophages. The late phase of infection, between days 4 and 5 postinfection, was characterized by a rapid increase in bacterial numbers, as well as escape of bacteria into the extracellular compartment. Annexin V staining of spleens indicated that a large proportion of splenic neutrophils underwent rapid apoptosis on days 1 and 2 postinfection. Fewer macrophages underwent apoptosis during the same period. Our data suggest that during the early stages of
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            infection, splenic neutrophils are responsible for limiting the growth of
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            and that splenic macrophages provide safe intracellular shelters within which
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            is able to grow and escape during the later stages of infection. This macrophage compliance can be overcome in vitro by stimulation with a combination of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Owing to its lumenal pH (‚àº5) and fusion with endolysosomal vesicles, the PV is considered phagolysosome-like. However, the degradative properties of the mature PV are unknown, and there are conflicting reports on the maturation state and growth permissiveness of PV harboring virulent phase I or avirulent phase II
            <jats:italic>C. burnetii</jats:italic>
            variants in human mononuclear phagocytes. Here, we employed infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and THP-1 cells as host cells to directly compare the PV maturation kinetics and pathogen growth in cells infected with the Nine Mile phase I variant (NMI) or phase II variant (NMII) of
            <jats:italic>C. burnetii</jats:italic>
            . In both cell types, phase variants replicated with similar kinetics, achieving roughly 2 to 3 log units of growth before they reached stationary phase. HMDMs infected by either phase variant secreted similar amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In infected THP-1 cells, equal percentages of NMI and NMII PVs decorate with the early endosomal marker Rab5, the late endosomal/lysosomal markers Rab7 and CD63, and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D at early (8 h) and late (72 h) time points postinfection (p.i.). Mature PVs (2 to 4 days p.i.) harboring NMI or NMII contained proteolytically active cathepsins and quickly degraded

            overlaps the promoter ‚àí10 box, whereas the operator site at

            is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, but it also frequently colonizes the human skin and mucosa without causing clinical symptoms. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin that has been associated with soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. We have compared the genotypes, virulence gene repertoires, and phage patterns of 74 furunculosis isolates with those of 108 control strains from healthy nasal carriers. The large majority of furunculosis strains were methicillin sensitive. Clonal cluster (CC) 121 (CC121) and CC22 accounted for 70% of the furunculosis strains but for only 8% of the nasal isolates. The PVL-encoding genes
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            were detected in 85% of furunculosis strains, while their prevalence among colonizing
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            strains was below 1%.
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            genes were distributed over several lineages (CCs 5, 8, 22, 30, and 121 and sequence type 59). Even within the same lineages,
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            -positive phages characterized furunculosis strains, while their
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            -negative variants were frequent among nasal strains. The very tight epidemiological linkage between
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            and furunculosis, which could be separated from the genetic background of the
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>mec</jats:italic>
            and accessory gene regulator group genotyping by multiplex PCR, and identification of toxin and potential virulence factor genes via PCR-based assays. Of 8,387 neonates, 115 (1.4%) had MRSA colonization and/or infection. The MRSA colonization rate declined significantly during the study period from 2.2 to 0.5/1,000 patient days (linear time,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>

            = 0.006). There were 19 cases of MRSA infection (16.5%). Few epidemiologic or clinical differences were identified between MRSA-colonized and MRSA-infected infants. Thirty-one different strains of MRSA were identified with a shift from hospital-associated to combined hospital- and community-associated strains over time.

These results highlight recent trends in MRSA colonization and infection and the corresponding changes in molecular epidemiology. Continued vigilance for this invasive pathogen remains critical, and specific attention to the unique host, the neonate, and the distinct environment, the NICU, is imperative.

            (MRSA) infections has changed worldwide. From being strictly nosocomial, MRSA is now frequently found as a community-associated (CA) pathogen. Denmark has been a low-prevalence country for MRSA since the mid-1970s but has in recent years experienced an increasing number of CA-MRSA cases. The aim of this study was to describe the emergence of CA-MRSA infections in Denmark. All Danish MRSA specimens and corresponding clinical data from 1999 to 2006 were investigated. Isolates were analyzed by antibiotic resistance and molecular typing and were assigned to clonal complexes (CC). Clinical data were extracted from discharge summaries and general practitioners' notes, from which assessments of community association were made for all infected cases. CA-MRSA cases constituted 29.4% of all MRSA infections (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 1,790) and an increasing proportion of the annual numbers of MRSA infections during the study period. CA-MRSA was associated with a young age, skin and soft tissue infections, and non-Danish origin. Transmission between household members was frequently reported. Molecular typing showed &gt;60 circulating clones, where 89.4% of the isolates belonged to five CC (CC80, CC8, CC30, CC5, and CC22), 81.2% carried staphylococcal cassette chromosome

Resistance to ‚â•3 antibiotic classes was observed for 48.8% of the isolates. The emergence of CA-MRSA in Denmark was caused by diverse strains, both well-known and new CA-MRSA strains. The results suggest multiple introductions of MRSA as an important source for CA-MRSA infections in Denmark.

            Central dogma, transformation, and genome editing are key biological concepts for which junior scientists must gain experience during training. Here we present an exercise that introduces these concepts in a single practical laboratory exercise. Our exercise utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to introduce a stop codon into
            <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>
            ADE2. This edit leads to the buildup of an adenine precursor that dyes the edited cells red. As the repair template, guide RNA, and Cas9 are all encoded in our vector, transformation can be performed in 2 hours. Furthermore, since all components of the Cas9/CRISPR system are encoded by the vector, specialized equipment and reagents, such as a PCR machine or oligonucleotides, are not required to perform the experiments as designed. As such, these exercises provide an efficient cost-effective introduction to a wide variety of key molecular biology concepts and lay the foundation for more rigorous investigations in upper-level classes and independent research projects.

            The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established its ASM-NSF (National Science Foundation) Biology Scholars Program (BSP) to promote undergraduate education reform by 1) supporting biologists to implement evidence-based teaching practices, 2) engaging life science professional societies to facilitate biologists‚Äô leadership in scholarly teaching within the discipline, and 3) participating in a teaching community that fosters disciplinary-level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) reform. Since 2005, the program has utilized year-long residency training to provide a continuum of learning and practice centered on principles from the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to more than 270 participants (‚Äúscholars‚Äù) from biology and multiple other disciplines. Additionally, the program has recruited 11 life science professional societies to support faculty development in SoTL and discipline-based education research (DBER). To identify the BSP‚Äôs long-term outcomes and impacts, ASM engaged an external evaluator to conduct a study of the program‚Äôs 2010‚Äì2014 scholars (

Study participants indicate that the program achieved its proposed goals relative to scholarship, professional society impact, leadership, community, and faculty professional development. Although participants also identified barriers that hindered elements of their BSP participation, findings suggest that the program was essential to their development as faculty and provides evidence of the BSP as a model for other societies seeking to advance undergraduate science education reform. The BSP is the longest-standing faculty development program sponsored by a collective group of life science societies. This collaboration promotes success across a fragmented system of more than 80 societies representing the life sciences and helps catalyze biology education reform efforts.

In this study, we explored the molecular basis for transmission of Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EAH1N1) swine influenza viruses by comparing two viruses that are genetically similar but differ in their transmissibility in guinea pigs: the A/swine/Guangxi/18/2011 virus (GX/18) is highly transmissible by respiratory droplet in guinea pigs, whereas the A/swine/Heilongjiang/27/2012 virus (HLJ/27) does not transmit in this animal model. We used reverse genetics to generate a series of reassortants and mutants in the GX/18 background and tested their transmissibility in guinea pigs. We found that a single-amino-acid substitution of glycine (G) for glutamic acid (E) at position 225 (E225G) in the HA1 protein completely abolished the respiratory droplet transmission of GX/18, whereas the substitution of E for G at the same position (G225E) in HA1 enabled HLJ/27 to transmit in guinea pigs. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that viruses bearing 225E in HA1 replicated more rapidly than viruses bearing 225G due to differences in assembly and budding efficiencies. Our study indicates that the amino acid 225E in HA1 plays a key role in EAH1N1 swine influenza virus transmission and provides important information for evaluating the pandemic potential of field influenza virus strains.</jats:p>

            Efficient transmission among humans is a prerequisite for a novel influenza virus to cause a human pandemic. Transmissibility of influenza viruses is a polygenic trait, and understanding the genetic determinants for transmissibility will provide useful insights for evaluating the pandemic potential of influenza viruses in the field. Several amino acids in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza viruses have been shown to be important for transmissibility, usually by increasing virus affinity for human-type receptors. In this study, we explored the genetic basis of the transmissibility difference between two Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EAH1N1) swine influenza viruses in guinea pigs and found that the amino acid glutamic acid at position 225 in the HA1 protein plays a critical role in the transmission of EAH1N1 virus by increasing the efficiency of viral assembly and budding.

          <jats:p>Successful replication of influenza virus requires the coordinated expression of viral genes and replication of the genome by the viral polymerase, composed of the subunits PA, PB1, and PB2. Polymerase activity is regulated by both viral and host factors, yet the mechanisms of regulation and how they contribute to viral pathogenicity and tropism are poorly understood. To characterize these processes, we created a series of mutants in the 627 domain of the PB2 subunit. This domain contains a conserved ‚ÄúP[F/P]AAAPP‚Äù sequence motif and the well-described amino acid 627, whose identity regulates host range. A lysine present at position 627 in most mammalian viral isolates creates a basic face on the domain surface and confers high-level activity in humans compared to the glutamic acid found at this position in avian isolates. Mutation of the basic face or the P[F/P]AAAPP motif impaired polymerase activity, assembly of replication complexes, and viral replication. Most of these residues are required for general polymerase activity, whereas PB2 K586 and R589 were preferentially required for function in human versus avian cells. Thus, these data identify residues in the 627 domain and other viral proteins that regulate polymerase activity, highlighting the importance of the surface charge and structure of this domain for virus replication and host adaptation.</jats:p>

            Influenza virus faces barriers to transmission across species as it emerges from its natural reservoir in birds to infect mammals. The viral polymerase is an important regulator of this process and undergoes discrete changes to adapt to replication in mammals. Many of these changes occur in the polymerase subunit PB2. Here we describe the systematic analysis of a key region in PB2 that controls species-specific polymerase activity. We report the importance of conserved residues that contribute to the overall charge of the protein as well as those that likely affect protein structure. These findings provide further insight into the molecular events dictating species-specific polymerase function and viral replication.

The U12 gene encoded a calcium-mobilizing receptor for the EBI1 ligand chemokine-macrophage inflammatory protein 3Œ≤ (ELC/MIP-3Œ≤) but not for other chemokines, suggesting that the chemokine selectivity of the U12 gene product is distinct from that of the known mammalian chemokine receptors.

All of the mutants replicated efficiently in tissue culture except region I mutants, which multiplied more poorly in human cells than the parental strain. Mutants with single deletions were not attenuated or only moderately so in athymic nude mice. Mutants with multiple deletions were more highly attenuated than those with single deletions. Deleting regions II, III, and V together resulted in total attenuation for nude mice and partial attenuation for SCID mice. In immunocompetent mice, the Lister deletion mutants induced VACV specific humoral responses equivalent to those of the parental strain but in some cases lower cell-mediated immune responses. All of the highly attenuated mutants protected mice from a severe cowpox virus challenge at low vaccine doses.

            The open reading frame K8 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZip) protein that binds to the origin of viral DNA replication and is an integral component of viral lytic DNA replication complex. Moreover, K8 physically interacts with replication and transcription activator (RTA) and represses its transactivation activity on several viral promoters. To investigate the role of this protein in viral life cycle, we constructed two K8-null recombinant mutant viruses (BAC-ŒîK8 and BAC-stopK8) by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system. Latent viral infection can be reconstituted in 293T and BJAB cells with wild-type and the K8-null recombinant viruses by introducing the cloned viral genomes into the cells. When the cells carrying these viruses were induced with 12-

However, 293T cells harboring K8-null mutant viruses, either BAC-ŒîK8 or BAC-stopK8, displayed lower copy numbers of latent KSHV genome in comparison with wild-type viruses. Furthermore, although K8 deficiency appeared to not affect infectivity when K8-null viruses were used to infect 293T, primary human microvascular dermal endothelial and human foreskin fibroblast cells, they exhibited much lower viral genome copy numbers in all types of cell compared to wild-type viruses. Taken together, these data suggest a possible role of K8 in abortive lytic DNA replication occurring in early stages of

            infection leads to robust induction of an innate immune signaling pathway referred to as the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP), characterized by expression of beta interferon (IFN-Œ≤) and coregulated genes. We previously identified the IFN-Œ≤ stimulatory ligand as secreted cyclic di-AMP. Synthesis of c-di-AMP in
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            is catalyzed by the diadenylate cyclase DacA, and multidrug resistance transporters are necessary for secretion. To identify additional bacterial factors involved in
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            detection by the CSP, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutants that induced altered levels of IFN-Œ≤. One mutant that stimulated elevated levels of IFN-Œ≤ harbored a transposon insertion in the gene
            <jats:italic>lmo0052</jats:italic>
            . Lmo0052, renamed here PdeA, has homology to a cyclic di-AMP phosphodiesterase, GdpP (formerly YybT), of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            and is able to degrade c-di-AMP to the linear dinucleotide pApA. Reduction of c-di-AMP levels by conditional depletion of the di-adenylate cyclase DacA or overexpression of PdeA led to marked decreases in growth rates, both
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and in macrophages. Additionally, mutants with altered levels of c-di-AMP had different susceptibilities to peptidoglycan-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that the molecule may be involved in regulating cell wall homeostasis. During intracellular infection, increases in c-di-AMP production led to hyperactivation of the CSP. Conditional depletion of
            <jats:italic>dacA</jats:italic>
            also led to increased IFN-Œ≤ expression and a concomitant increase in host cell pyroptosis, a result of increased bacteriolysis and subsequent bacterial DNA release. These data suggest that c-di-AMP coordinates bacterial growth, cell wall stability, and responses to stress and plays a crucial role in the establishment of bacterial infection.

            stimulates expression of IFN-Œ≤ and coregulated genes dependent upon host detection of a secreted bacterial signaling nucleotide, c-di-AMP. Using a forward genetic screen for mutants that induced high levels of host IFN-Œ≤ expression, we identified a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase, PdeA, that degrades c-di-AMP. Here we characterize
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            mutants that express enhanced or diminished levels of c-di-AMP. Decreased c-di-AMP levels by conditional depletion of the diadenylate cyclase (DacA) or overexpression of PdeA attenuated bacterial growth and led to bacteriolysis, suggesting that its production is essential for viability and may regulate cell wall metabolism. Mutants lacking PdeA had a distinct transcriptional profile, which may provide insight into additional roles for the molecule. This work demonstrates that c-di-AMP is a critical signaling molecule required for bacterial replication, cell wall stability, and pathogenicity.

LbpA is an integral outer membrane-embedded iron transporter, whereas LbpB is a cell surface-exposed lipoprotein. In this study, we demonstrate that LbpB is also released into the culture medium. We identified NalP, an autotransporter known to be involved in the processing of other autotransporters, as the protease responsible for LbpB release. This release of LbpB reduced the complement-mediated killing of the bacteria when incubated with an LbpB-specific bactericidal antiserum. Since antibodies directed against LbpB are found in convalescent-patient sera, the release of an immunogenic protein as LbpB may represent a novel means for

To determine the biological significance of the RT-IN interaction during viral replication, we used the NMR chemical shift mapping information as a guide to introduce single amino acid substitutions of nine different residues on the putative RT-binding surface in the IN CTD.

We previously demonstrated that Rosco inhibits the transactivating activity of ICP0. In the present study, we asked whether Rosco also affects the ability of ICP0 to direct the degradation of ND10-associated proteins. For this purpose, WI-38 cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) were mock infected or infected with wild-type HSV-1 or an ICP0<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>mutant (7134). After release from the CHX block, the infections were allowed to proceed for 2 h in the presence or absence of Rosco at a concentration known to inhibit ICP0's transactivating activity. The cells were then examined for the presence of ICP0 and selected ND10-associated antigens (promyelocytic leukemia antigen [PML], sp100, hDaxx, and NDP55) by immunofluorescence. Staining for the ND10-associated antigens was detected in ≤20% of KOS-infected cells in the presence or absence of Rosco, demonstrating that Rosco-sensitive kinases are not required for ICP0's ability to direct the dispersal or degradation of these antigens. In contrast, &gt;90% of 7134- and mock-infected cells stained positive for all ND10-associated antigens in the presence or absence of Rosco.

            With the extensive use of antibiotics, multidrug-resistant bacteria emerge frequently. New antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action are urgently needed. It is now widely accepted that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could be promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this study, we aimed to study the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of protonectin, a cationic peptide from the venom of the neotropical social wasp

            . We demonstrated that protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. To further understand this mechanism, the structural features of protonectin and its analogs were studied by circular dichroism (CD). The CD spectra demonstrated that protonectin and its natural analog polybia-CP formed a typical α-helical conformation in the membrane-mimicking environment, while its proline-substituted analog had much lower or even no α-helix conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the α-helical conformation in the membrane is required for the exhibition of antibacterial activity. In conclusion, protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity by disruption of the integrity of the bacterial membrane, and its α-helical confirmation in the membrane is essential for this action.

Because interleukin-12 (IL-12) and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing cytidine phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs have been shown to enhance Th1 responses in vivo, they were chosen as adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of BCG vaccination. In this report, mice were vaccinated with BCG with or without IL-12 or CpG ODN and then challenged 6 weeks later via the aerosol route with the Erdman strain of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>. Mice vaccinated with BCG alone showed a 1- to 2-log reduction in bacterial load compared with control mice that did not receive any vaccination prior to<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>challenge. Moreover, the bacterial loads of mice vaccinated with BCG plus IL-12 or CpG ODN were a further two- to fivefold lower than those of mice vaccinated with BCG alone. As an immune correlate, the antigen-specific production IFN-γ and mRNA expression in spleen cells prior to challenge were evaluated. Mice vaccinated with BCG plus IL-12 or CpG ODN showed enhanced production of IFN-γ compared with mice vaccinated with BCG alone. Finally, granulomas in BCG-vaccinated mice were smaller and more lymphocyte rich than those in unvaccinated mice; however, the addition of IL-12 or CpG ODN to BCG vaccination did not alter granuloma formation or result in added pulmonary damage. These observations support a role for immune adjuvants given with BCG vaccination to enhance its biologic efficacy.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA,2000,Data/html/10.1128_iai.68.5.2948-2953.2000.html,No,No,Data/predicted/10.1128_iai.68.5.2948-2953.2000.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the infection spreads to the heart, nervous system, and other parts of the body via the circulatory system, the parasite must also cope with additional receptors in the immune system and vascular endothelium. The molecular underpinnings that govern host cell receptor recognition by<jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic>counterreceptors remain largely unknown. Here, we describe an immunoprecipitation strategy designed to concurrently identify host receptors and complementing parasite counterreceptors. Extracellular domains of growth factor receptors fused to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc were incubated with parasite lysates, immunoprecipitated on protein G-Sepharose, and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Possible<jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic>counterreceptors pulled down by the receptor-Fc bait were visualized on immunoblots probed with multispecific high-affinity IgG from chronic chagasic sera and on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels stained with silver or Coomassie blue. In screening receptors important for nervous system repair, this parasite counterreceptor immunoprecipitation (PcIP) assay identified 7 to 11 polypeptides (molecular masses, 14 kDa to 55 kDa) that bound to the coreceptors of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) GFRα-1, -2, and -3. Binding was specific because the<jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic>mimic of host GFLs, named TGFL, did not react with GFL coreceptor tyrosine kinase RET and with other neurotrophic receptors. The polypeptides were located on the parasite outer membrane and bound noncovalently to each other. TGFL eluted from the GFL receptor/protein G affinity column with 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and potently promoted neurite outgrowth and cell survival in a GFL-sensitive mouse pheochromocytoma cell line. Given that GFLs are neuron survival factors crucial for development and maintenance of central and peripheral nervous systems, it may be that<jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic>mimicry of host GFLs helps in mutually beneficial host repair of infected and damaged nervous tissue. As there are &gt;30 growth factor receptor-Fc chimeras commercially available, this PcIP assay can be readily adapted to identify receptors/counterreceptors in other<jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic>invasion sites and in other infections such as Lyme disease, amebiasis, and schistosomiasis.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA,2008,Data/html/10.1128_iai.00411-08.html,No,No,Data/predicted/10.1128_iai.00411-08.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The development of clinically latent BCG coinfection in these SIVmac-infected monkeys was characterized by a change from high to undetectable levels of bacterial organisms, with or without measurable BCG mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The reactivation of clinically latent BCG coinfection and development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease were then observed in these SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys during a 21-month period of follow-up. The reactivation of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease in these animals coincided with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells and a loss of BCG-specific T-cell responses. Interestingly, bacterial superantigen challenge of the SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys resulted in an up-regulation of clinically latent BCG coinfection, suggesting that infection with superantigen-producing microbes may increase the susceptibility of individuals to the reactivation of AIDS-related mycobacterial coinfection. Thus, reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in HIV-1-infected individuals may result from a loss of T-cell immunity or from a superimposed further compromise of the immune system.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2004,Data/html/10.1128_jvi.78.24.14023-14032.2004.html,No,No,Data/predicted/10.1128_jvi.78.24.14023-14032.2004.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Small noncoding RNAs regulate a variety of cellular processes, including genomic imprinting, chromatin remodeling, replication, transcription, and translation. Here, we report small replication-regulating RNAs (srRNAs) that specifically inhibit DNA replication of the human BK polyomavirus (BKV)

            . srRNAs from FM3A murine mammary tumor cells were enriched by DNA replication assay-guided fractionation and hybridization to the BKV noncoding control region (NCCR) and synthesized as cDNAs. Selective mutagenesis of the cDNA sequences and their putative targets suggests that the inhibition of BKV DNA replication is mediated by srRNAs binding to the viral NCCR, hindering early steps in the initiation of DNA replication. Ectopic expression of srRNAs in human cells inhibited BKV DNA replication
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Additional srRNAs were designed and synthesized that specifically inhibit simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication

            . These observations point to novel mechanisms for regulating DNA replication and suggest the design of synthetic agents for inhibiting replication of polyomaviruses and possibly other viruses.

            suggested that Lo18 had a higher affinity for control liposomes than for a model protein.

            The failure of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, a possibly critical reason was the lack of protective mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract. Here, we evaluated the effects of mucosal and systemic immunity from a novel simian adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Sad23L-nCoV-S) in mice in comparison with Ad5-nCoV-S by intranasal (IN) drip and intramuscular (IM) injection vaccinations. As good as the well-known Ad5-nCoV-S vaccine, a single-dose IN inoculation of 1 × 10
            <jats:sup>9</jats:sup>
            PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced a similar level of IgG S-binding antibody (S-BAb) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) and higher IgA in serum, while IN route raised significantly higher IgG and IgA S-BAb and NAb in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and specific IFN-γ secreting T-cell response in lung compared with IM route, but lower T-cell response in spleen. By prime-boost vaccination regimens with different combinations of IN and IM inoculations of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine, the IN-involved vaccination stimulated higher protective mucosal or local immunity in BAL and lung, while the IM-involved immunization induced higher systemic immunity in serum and spleen. A long-term sustained mucosal and systemic NAb and T- cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was maintained at high level over 32 weeks by prime-boost vaccination regimens with IN and IM routes. In conclusion, priming or boosting immunization with IN inoculation of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine could induce effective mucosal immunity and in combination of IM route could additionally achieve systemic immunity, which provided an important reference for vaccination regimens against respiratory virus infection.

            Minimizing the use of antibiotics in the food production chain is essential for limiting the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One alternative intervention strategy is the use of probiotic bacteria, and bacteria of the marine
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Roseobacter</jats:named-content>
            clade are capable of antagonizing fish-pathogenic vibrios in fish larvae and live feed cultures for fish larvae. The antibacterial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA), an antiporter that disrupts the proton motive force, is key in the antibacterial activity of several roseobacters. Introducing probiotics on a larger scale requires understanding of any potential side effects of long-term exposure of the pathogen to the probionts or any compounds they produce. Here we exposed the fish pathogen
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Vibrio anguillarum</jats:named-content>
            to TDA for several hundred generations in an adaptive evolution experiment. No tolerance or resistance arose during the 90 days of exposure, and whole-genome sequencing of TDA-exposed lineages and clones revealed few mutational changes, compared to lineages grown without TDA. Amino acid-changing mutations were found in two to six different genes per clone; however, no mutations appeared unique to the TDA-exposed lineages or clones. None of the virulence genes of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">V. anguillarum</jats:named-content>
            was affected, and infectivity assays using fish cell lines indicated that the TDA-exposed lineages and clones were less invasive than the wild-type strain. Thus, long-term TDA exposure does not appear to result in TDA resistance and the physiology of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">V. anguillarum</jats:named-content>
            appears unaffected, supporting the application of TDA-producing roseobacters as probiotics in aquaculture.

            It is important to limit the use of antibiotics in our food production, to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. We showed previously that marine bacteria of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Roseobacter</jats:named-content>
            clade can prevent or reduce bacterial diseases in fish larvae, acting as probiotics. Roseobacters produce the antimicrobial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA), and we were concerned regarding whether long-term exposure to this compound could induce resistance or affect the disease-causing ability of the fish pathogen. Therefore, we exposed the fish pathogen
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Vibrio anguillarum</jats:named-content>
            to increasing TDA concentrations over 3 months. We did not see the development of any resistance to TDA, and subsequent infection assays revealed that none of the TDA-exposed clones had increased virulence toward fish cells. Hence, this study supports the use of roseobacters as a non-risk-based disease control measure in aquaculture.

          <jats:p>A novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus, first detected in January 2014 in poultry and wild birds in South Korea, has spread throughout Asia and Europe and caused outbreaks in Canada and the United States by the end of the year. The spread of H5N8 and the novel reassortant viruses, H5N2 and H5N1 (H5Nx), in domestic poultry across multiple states in the United States pose a potential public health risk. To evaluate the potential of cross-species infection, we determined the pathogenicity and transmissibility of two Asian-origin H5Nx viruses in mammalian animal models. The newly isolated H5N2 and H5N8 viruses were able to cause severe disease in mice only at high doses. Both viruses replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of ferrets; however, the clinical symptoms were generally mild, and there was no evidence of systemic dissemination of virus to multiple organs. Moreover, these influenza H5Nx viruses lacked the ability to transmit between ferrets in a direct contact setting. We further assessed viral replication kinetics of the novel H5Nx viruses in a human bronchial epithelium cell line, Calu-3. Both H5Nx viruses replicated to a level comparable to a human seasonal H1N1 virus, but significantly lower than a virulent Asian-lineage H5N1 HPAI virus. Although the recently isolated H5N2 and H5N8 viruses displayed moderate pathogenicity in mammalian models, their ability to rapidly spread among avian species, reassort, and generate novel strains underscores the need for continued risk assessment in mammals.</jats:p>

            In 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses have caused outbreaks in domestic poultry in multiple U.S. states. The economic losses incurred with H5N8 and H5N2 subtype virus infection have raised serious concerns for the poultry industry and the general public due to the potential risk of human infection. This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals, which is an essential component of pandemic risk assessment. This study demonstrates that the newly isolated H5N2 and H5N8 viruses lacked the ability to transmit between ferrets and exhibited low to moderate virulence in mammals. In human bronchial epithelial (Calu-3) cells, both H5N8 and H5N2 viruses replicated to a level comparable to a human seasonal virus, but significantly lower than a virulent Asian-lineage H5N1 (A/Thailand/16/2004) virus. The results of this study are important for the evaluation of public health risk.

            The clinical significance of persistent residual viremia in patients on prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not clear. Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated whether residual viremia consists of viruses capable of spreading infection

Using residual viral RNAs (vRNAs) isolated from a HAART-treated patient's plasma, we cloned full-length viral genomes and found that most of them could produce infectious, replication-competent HIVs when transfected into TZM-bl cells, suggesting that residual viruses produced in the absence of therapy can initiate fresh cycles of infection and spread in host cells. The data further indicate that residual viremia may pose a major concern with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant HIVs during periods of low adherence to therapy.

The other four genomes were related but notably different. The length of the genomes varied from 28,144 to 32,182 bp, and they coded for 51 to 55 open reading frames.

            Like many other bacteria,

            possesses two types of

            -malate dehydrogenase, a membrane-associated malate:quinone oxidoreductase (MQO; EC

            ) and a cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC
            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""ec"" xlink:href=""1.1.1.37"" xlink:type=""simple"">1.1.1.37</jats:ext-link>
            ) The regulation of MDH and of the three membrane-associated dehydrogenases MQO, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and NADH dehydrogenase was investigated. MQO, MDH, and SDH activities are regulated coordinately in response to the carbon and energy source for growth. Compared to growth on glucose, these activities are increased during growth on lactate, pyruvate, or acetate, substrates which require high citric acid cycle activity to sustain growth. The simultaneous presence of high activities of both malate dehydrogenases is puzzling. MQO is the most important malate dehydrogenase in the physiology of
            <jats:italic>C. glutamicum</jats:italic>
            . A mutant with a site-directed deletion in the
            <jats:italic>mqo</jats:italic>
            gene does not grow on minimal medium. Growth can be partially restored in this mutant by addition of the vitamin nicotinamide. In contrast, a double mutant lacking MQO and MDH does not grow even in the presence of nicotinamide. Apparently, MDH is able to take over the function of MQO in an
            <jats:italic>mqo</jats:italic>
            mutant, but this requires the presence of nicotinamide in the growth medium. It is shown that addition of nicotinamide leads to a higher intracellular pyridine nucleotide concentration, which probably enables MDH to catalyze malate oxidation. Purified MDH from
            <jats:italic>C. glutamicum</jats:italic>
            catalyzes oxaloacetate reduction much more readily than malate oxidation at physiological pH. In a reconstituted system with isolated membranes and purified MDH, MQO and MDH catalyze the cyclic conversion of malate and oxaloacetate, leading to a net oxidation of NADH. Evidence is presented that this cyclic reaction also takes place in vivo. As yet, no phenotype of an
            <jats:italic>mdh</jats:italic>
            deletion alone was observed, which leaves a physiological function for MDH in
            <jats:italic>C. glutamicum</jats:italic>
            obscure.

          <jats:p>Similar to other segmented RNA viruses, influenza viruses can exchange genome segments and form a wide variety of reassortant strains upon coreplication within a host cell. Therefore, the mapping of genome segments of influenza viruses is essential for understanding their phenotypes. In this work, we have developed an oligonucleotide microarray hybridization method for simultaneous genotyping of all genomic segments of two highly homologous strains of influenza B virus. A few strain-specific oligonucleotide probes matching each of the eight segments of the viral genomes of the B/Beijing/184/93 and B/Shangdong/7/97 strains were hybridized with PCR-amplified fluorescently labeled single-stranded DNA. Even though there were a few mismatches among the genomes of the studied virus strains, microarray hybridization showed highly significant and reproducible discrimination ability and allowed us to determine the origins of individual genomic segments in a series of reassortant strains prepared as vaccine candidates. Additionally, we were able to detect the presence of at least 5% of mixed genotypes in virus stocks even when conventional sequencing methods failed, for example, for the NS segment. Thus, the proposed microarray method can be used for (i) rapid and reliable genome mapping of highly homologous influenza B viruses and (ii) extensive monitoring of influenza B virus reassortants and the mixed genotypes. The array can be expanded by adding new oligoprobes and using more quantitative assays to determine the origin of individual genomic segments in series of reassortant strains prepared as vaccine candidates or in mixed virus populations.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA,2004,Data/html/10.1128_jcm.42.12.5793-5801.2004.html,Yes,Yes,Data/predicted/10.1128_jcm.42.12.5793-5801.2004.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            <jats:p>The microbiome plays vital roles in the life history of mosquitoes, including their development, immunity, longevity, and vector competence. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed for detailed exploration into the diverse microorganisms harbored by these medically important insects. Although these meta-studies have cataloged the microbiomes of mosquitoes in several continents, much of the information currently available for North America is limited to the state of California. In this study, we collected &gt;35,000 mosquitoes throughout Manitoba, Canada, over a 3-year period and then harnessed RNA sequencing and targeted reverse transcriptase-PCR to characterize the microbiomes of the eight most pervasive and important vector and pest species. The consensus microbiome of each species was overwhelmingly composed of viruses but also included fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and parasitic invertebrates. The microbial assemblages were heterogeneous between species, even within the same genus. We detected notable pathogens, including the causal agents of Cache Valley Fever, avian malaria, and canine heartworm. The remaining microbiome consisted largely of putatively insect-specific viruses that are not well characterized, including 17 newly discovered viruses from 10 different families. Future research should focus on evaluating the potential application of these viruses in biocontrol, as biomarkers, and/or in disrupting mosquito vectorial capacity. Interestingly, we also detected viruses that naturally infect honeybees and thrips, which were presumably acquired indirectly through nectar foraging behaviors. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive catalog of the microorganisms harbored by the most common and important mosquito vectors and pests in the Canadian Prairies.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Mosquitoes are the most dangerous animals on the planet, responsible for over 800,000 deaths per year globally. This is because they carry and transmit a plethora of human disease-causing microorganisms, such as West Nile virus and the malaria parasite. Recent innovations in nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled researchers unparalleled opportunities to characterize the suite of microorganisms harbored by different mosquito species, including the causal agents of disease. In our study, we carried out 3 years of intensive mosquito surveillance in Canada. We collected and characterized the microorganisms harbored by &gt;35,000 mosquitoes, including the identification of the agents of Cache Valley fever, avian malaria, and canine heartworm. We also detected insect-specific viruses and discovered 17 new viruses that have never been reported. This study, which is the first of its kind in Canada and one of only a handful globally, will greatly aid in future infectious disease research.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>During the dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) epidemic that occurred in Havana in 2001 to 2002, severe disease was associated with the infection sequence DENV-1 followed by DENV-3 (DENV-1/DENV-3), while the sequence DENV-2/DENV-3 was associated with mild/asymptomatic infections. To determine the role of the virus in the increasing severity demonstrated during the epidemic, serum samples collected at different time points were studied. A total of 22 full-length sequences were obtained using a deep-sequencing approach. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences revealed that two DENV-3 lineages were circulating in Havana at that time, both grouped within genotype III. The predominant lineage is closely related to Peruvian and Ecuadorian strains, while the minor lineage is related to Venezuelan strains. According to consensus sequences, relatively few nonsynonymous mutations were observed; only one was fixed during the epidemic at position 4380 in the NS2B gene. Intrahost genetic analysis indicated that a significant minor population was selected and became predominant toward the end of the epidemic. In conclusion, greater variability was detected during the epidemic's progression in terms of significant minority variants, particularly in the nonstructural genes. An increasing trend of genetic diversity toward the end of the epidemic was observed only for synonymous variant allele rates, with higher variability in secondary cases. Remarkably, significant intrahost genetic variation was demonstrated within the same patient during the course of secondary infection with DENV-1/DENV-3, including changes in the structural proteins premembrane (PrM) and envelope (E). Therefore, the dynamic of evolving viral populations in the context of heterotypic antibodies could be related to the increasing clinical severity observed during the epidemic.</jats:p>

            Based on the evidence that DENV fitness is context dependent, our research has focused on the study of viral factors associated with intraepidemic increasing severity in a unique epidemiological setting. Here, we investigated the intrahost genetic diversity in acute human samples collected at different time points during the DENV-3 epidemic that occurred in Cuba in 2001 to 2002 using a deep-sequencing approach. We concluded that greater variability in significant minor populations occurred as the epidemic progressed, particularly in the nonstructural genes, with higher variability observed in secondary infection cases. Remarkably, for the first time significant intrahost genetic variation was demonstrated within the same patient during the course of secondary infection with DENV-1/DENV-3, including changes in structural proteins. These findings indicate that high-resolution approaches are needed to unravel molecular mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis.

The antiviral function of ND10 is antagonized by viral regulatory proteins such as the immediate early protein IE1 of HCMV. IE1 interacts with PML through its globular core domain (IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>) and induces ND10 disruption in order to initiate lytic HCMV infection. Here, we investigate the consequences of a point mutation (L174P) in IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>, which was shown to abrogate the interaction with PML, for lytic HCMV infection. We found that a recombinant HCMV encoding IE1-L174P displays a severe growth defect similar to that of an IE1 deletion virus. Bioinformatic modeling based on the crystal structure of IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>suggested that insertion of proline into the highly alpha-helical domain severely affects its structural integrity. Consistently, L174P mutation abrogates the functionality of IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>and results in degradation of the IE1 protein during infection. In addition, our data provide evidence that IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>as expressed by a recombinant HCMV encoding IE1 1-382 not only is required to antagonize PML-mediated intrinsic immunity but also affects a recently described function of PML in innate immune signaling. We demonstrate a coregulatory role of PML in type I and type II interferon-induced gene expression and provide evidence that upregulation of interferon-induced genes is inhibited by IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>. In conclusion, our data suggest that targeting PML by viral regulatory proteins represents a strategy to antagonize both intrinsic and innate immune mechanisms.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which represent nuclear multiprotein complexes consisting of PML and additional proteins, represent important cellular structures that mediate intrinsic resistance against many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). During HCMV infection, the major immediate early protein IE1 binds to PML via a central globular domain (IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>), and we have shown previously that this is sufficient to antagonize intrinsic immunity. Here, we demonstrate that modification of PML by IE1<jats:sub>CORE</jats:sub>not only abrogates intrinsic defense mechanisms but also attenuates the interferon response during infection.

            <jats:p>Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are host to diverse microbial communities and receive a constant influx of microbes from influent wastewater. However, the impact of immigrants on the structure and activities of the activated sludge (AS) microbial community remains unclear. To gain insight on this phenomenon known as perpetual community coalescence, the current study utilized controlled manipulative experiments that decoupled the influent wastewater composition from the microbial populations to reveal the fundamental mechanisms involved in immigration between sewers and AS-WWTP. The immigration dynamics of heterotrophs were analyzed by harvesting wastewater biomass solids from three different sewer systems and adding to synthetic wastewater. Immigrating influent populations were observed to contribute up to 14% of the sequencing reads in the AS. By modeling the net growth rate of taxa, it was revealed that immigrants primarily exhibited low or negative net growth rates. By developing a protocol to reproducibly grow AS-WWTP communities in the lab, we have laid down the foundational principles for the testing of operational factors creating community variations with low noise and appropriate replication. Understanding the processes that drive microbial community diversity and assembly is a key question in microbial ecology. In the future, this knowledge can be used to manipulate the structure of microbial communities and improve system performance in WWTPs.</jats:p>

This study developed a reproducible protocol to investigate the impact of influent immigration (or perpetual coalescence of the sewer and activated sludge communities) with appropriate reproducibility and controls, allowing intrinsic definitions of core and immigrant populations to be established. The method developed herein will allow sequential manipulative experiments to be performed to test specific hypothesis and optimize wastewater treatment processes to meet new treatment goals.</jats:p>

            . Comparison of results from outdoor tests under different conditions requires the use of genetically identical strains; however, the requirement for isogenic strains limits the ability to compare other desirable properties, such as the behavior in the environment of the same strain prepared using different methods. Finally, current methods do not allow long-term studies of persistence or reaerosolization in test sites where simulants are heavily used or in areas where

            is applied as a biopesticide. To create a set of genetically heterogeneous yet phenotypically indistinguishable strains so that variables intrinsic to simulations (e.g., sample preparation) can be varied and the strains can be tested under otherwise identical conditions, we have developed a strategy of introducing small genetic signatures (“barcodes”) into neutral regions of the genome. The barcodes are stable over 300 generations and do not impact
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            growth or sporulation. Each barcode contains common and specific tags that allow differentiation of marked strains from wild-type strains and from each other. Each tag is paired with specific real-time PCR assays that facilitate discrimination of barcoded strains from wild-type strains and from each other. These uniquely barcoded strains will be valuable tools for research into the environmental fate of released organisms by providing specific artificial detection signatures.

A/E pathogens utilize a type III secretion system (TTSS), encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, to deliver effector proteins into host cells. Here, we investigate sequence divergence of the LEE-encoded SepZ protein and identify it as a TTSS-secreted and -translocated molecule. SepZ is hypervariable among A/E pathogens, with sequences sharing between 60 to 81% amino acid identity with SepZ of EPEC. A SepZ-CyaA fusion was secreted and translocated into HeLa cells in a TTSS-dependent manner. Additionally, we determined that the first 20 amino acids of SepZ were sufficient to direct its translocation. In contrast to previous studies suggesting a role in invasion and the structure and/or regulation of the TTSS, we found that SepZ does not mediate uptake of EPEC into host cells or affect translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of the translocated intimin receptor. Immunohistochemistry reveals that, after an extended HeLa cell infection, accumulated SepZ can be detected beneath the site of bacterial attachment in a subset of pedestal regions. To indicate its newly identified status as a translocated effector protein, we propose to rename SepZ as EspZ.

Pilin expression and antigenic variation can be modulated in response to environmental cues; however, the precise mechanisms of such regulation remain unclear. We identified a promoter in the

We show that this promoter directs transcription of an AS RNA that is expressed during specific growth phases and in response to salt stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcript encompasses sequences complementary to the entire
            <jats:italic>pilE</jats:italic>
            coding sequence and 5′ untranslated region. AS RNAs can regulate the gene on the sense strand by altering transcript stability or translation.

These effects were not due to inhibition of mycolate synthesis, since total mycolate levels were unaffected, but instead resulted in the accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), the precursor of TDM and cell wall mycolates.

We have examined the prM/M and a portion of the E protein for a panel of 38 wild strains of YF virus from Africa representing different countries and times of isolation. Examination of the strains revealed a more complex genetic relationship than previously reported. Overall, nucleotide substitutions varied from 0 to 25.8% and amino acid substitutions varied from 0 to 9.1%. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony and neighbor-joining algorithms identified five distinct genotypes: central/east Africa, east Africa, Angola, west Africa I, and west Africa II. Extensive variation within genotypes was observed. Members of west African genotype II and central/east African genotype differed by 2.8% or less, while west Africa genotype I varied up to 6.8% at the nucleotide level. We speculate that the former two genotypes exist in enzootic transmission cycles, while the latter is genetically more heterogeneous due to regular human epidemics. The nucleotide sequence of the Angola genotype diverged from the others by 15.7 to 23.0% but only 0.4 to 5.6% at the amino acid level, suggesting that this genotype most likely diverged from a progenitor YF virus in east/central Africa many years ago, prior to the separation of the other east/central African strains analyzed in this study, and has evolved independently. These data demonstrate that there are multiple genotypes of YF virus in Africa and suggest independent evolution of YF virus in different areas of Africa.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2001,Data/html/10.1128_jvi.75.15.6999-7008.2001.html,No,Yes,Data/predicted/10.1128_jvi.75.15.6999-7008.2001.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            The simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) naturally infect a wide range of African primates, including African green monkeys (AGM). Despite moderate to high levels of plasma viremia in naturally infected AGM, infection is not associated with immunodeficiency. We recently reported that SIVagmVer90 isolated from a naturally infected vervet AGM induced AIDS following experimental inoculation of pigtailed macaques. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the replication of this isolate in two species of AGM, sabaeus monkeys (
            <jats:italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</jats:italic>
            ) and vervets (
            <jats:italic>C. pygerythrus</jats:italic>
            ). Inoculation of sabaeus AGM with SIVagmVer90 resulted in low and variable primary and set-point viremia (&lt;10

            T cells in lymph node biopsies, consistent with an early antiviral immune response. The preferential replication of SIVagmVer in vervet versus sabaeus AGM shows that it is critical to match AGM species and SIV strains for experimental models of natural SIV infection.

            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>
            patients that may be increasing with long-term therapy. In the present study, we investigated whether envelope (

The tropism and characteristics of the brain-derived Envs were then investigated and compared to those of Envs derived from immune tissue. We showed that (i) macrophage-tropic R5 Envs could be detected in the brain tissue of 4/12 N/MC individuals, (ii) macrophage-tropic Envs in brain tissue formed compartmentalized clusters distinct from non-macrophage-tropic (non-mac-tropic) Envs recovered from the spleen or brain, (iii) the evidence was consistent with active viral expression by macrophage-tropic variants in the brain tissue of some individuals, and (iv) Envs from immune tissue of the N/MC individuals were nearly all tightly non-mac-tropic, contrasting with previous data for neuro-AIDS patients where immune tissue Envs mediated a range of macrophage infectivities, from background levels to modest infection, with a small number of Envs from some patients mediating high macrophage infection levels. In summary, the data presented here show that compartmentalized and active macrophage-tropic HIV-1 variants are present in the brain tissue of individuals before neurological disease becomes overt or serious.

            The detection of highly compartmentalized macrophage-tropic R5 Envs in the brain tissue of HIV patients without serious neurological disease is consistent with their emergence from a viral population already established there, perhaps from early disease. The detection of active macrophage-tropic virus expression, and probably replication, indicates that antiretroviral drugs with optimal penetration through the blood-brain barrier should be considered even for patients without neurological disease (neuro-disease). Finally, our data are consistent with the brain forming a sanctuary site for latent virus and low-level viral replication in the absence of neuro-disease.

            Human herpesviruses 6A/B (HHV-6A/B) can integrate their viral genomes in the telomeres of human chromosomes. The viral and cellular factors contributing to HHV-6A/B integration remain largely unknown, mostly due to the lack of efficient and reproducible cell culture models to study HHV-6A/B integration. In this study, we characterized the HHV-6A/B integration efficiencies in several human cell lines using two different approaches. First, after a short-term infection (5 h), cells were processed for single-cell cloning and analyzed for chromosomally integrated HHV-6A/B (ciHHV-6A/B). Second, cells were infected with HHV-6A/B and allowed to grow in bulk for 4 weeks or longer and then analyzed for the presence of ciHHV-6. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), droplet digital PCR, and fluorescent
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization, we could demonstrate that HHV-6A/B integrated in most human cell lines tested, including telomerase-positive (HeLa, MCF-7, HCT-116, and HEK293T) and telomerase-negative cell lines (U2OS and GM847). Our results also indicate that inhibition of DNA replication, using phosphonoacetic acid, did not affect HHV-6A/B integration. Certain clones harboring ciHHV-6A/B spontaneously express viral genes and proteins. Treatment of cells with phorbol ester or histone deacetylase inhibitors triggered the expression of many viral genes, including
            <jats:italic>U39</jats:italic>
            ,
            <jats:italic>U90</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>U100</jats:italic>

In summary, both integration models yielded comparable results and should enable the identification of viral and cellular factors contributing to HHV-6A/B integration and the screening of drugs influencing viral gene expression, as well as the release of infectious HHV-6A/B from the integrated state.

            The analysis and understanding of HHV-6A/B genome integration into host DNA is currently limited due to the lack of reproducible and efficient viral integration systems. In the present study, we describe two quantitative cell culture viral integration systems. These systems can be used to define cellular and viral factors that play a role in HHV-6A/B integration. Furthermore, these systems will allow us to decipher the conditions resulting in virus gene expression and excision of the integrated viral genome resulting in reactivation.

          <jats:p>Human enteroviruses can serve as a more accurate indicator of human fecal contamination than conventional bacteriological fecal indicators. We describe here a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay specifically tailored to detect these viruses in environmental waters. The assay included a competitive internal positive control (CIPC) that allowed the inhibition of qRT-PCRs to be quantitatively assessed. Coamplification of the CIPC with enteroviral genetic material did not affect the sensitivity, specificity, or reproducibility of the enteroviral qRT-PCR assay. The assay is rapid (less than 5 h from sample to result), has a wide dynamic range (&gt;3 logs), and is capable of detecting as few as 25 enteroviral genomes with an average amplification efficiency of 0.91. In samples with low or moderate inhibition, the delay in CIPC amplification was used to adjust enterovirus qRT-PCR concentrations to account for losses due to inhibition. Samples exhibiting significant inhibition were not corrected but instead diluted twofold and immediately assayed again. Using significantly inhibited samples, it was found that dilution relieved inhibition in 93% (25 of 27) of the samples. In addition, 15% (4 of 27) of these previously negative samples contained enteroviral genomes. The high-throughput format of the assay compared to conventional culture-based methods offers a fast, reliable, and specific method for detecting enteroviruses in environmental water samples. The ability of the assay to identify false negatives and provide improved quantitative assessments of enterovirus concentrations will facilitate the tracking of human fecal contamination and the assessment of potential public health risk due to enteroviruses in recreational and shellfish harvesting waters.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA,2006,Data/html/10.1128_aem.02291-05.html,No,Yes,Data/predicted/10.1128_aem.02291-05.csv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

P2 binds to both the aphid receptor and P3, itself tightly associated with the virus particle, with the ensemble forming a transmissible viral complex. Here, we describe the conformations of both unliganded CaMV P3 protein and its virion-associated form. X-ray crystallography revealed that the N-terminal domain of unliganded P3 is a tetrameric parallel coiled coil with a unique organization showing two successive four-stranded subdomains with opposite supercoiling handedness stabilized by a ring of interchain disulfide bridges. A structural model of virus-liganded P3 proteins, folding as an antiparallel coiled-coil network coating the virus surface, was derived from molecular modeling. Our results highlight the structural and biological versatility of this coiled-coil structure and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in CaMV acquisition and transmission by the insect vector.

            <jats:italic>mep45</jats:italic>
            gene and investigated the relationship between PG-cadaverine, Mep45, and the cell surface structure. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that Mep45 is comprised of an N-terminal S-layer-homologous (SLH) domain followed by α-helical coiled-coil region and a C-terminal β-strand-rich region. The N-terminal SLH domain was found to be protruding into the periplasmic space and was responsible for binding to peptidoglycan. It was determined that Mep45 binds to the peptidoglycan in a manner dependent on the presence of PG-cadaverine. Electron microscopy revealed that defective PG-cadaverine decreased the structural interactions between peptidoglycan and the outer membrane, consistent with the proposed role for PG-cadaverine. The C-terminal β-strand-rich region of Mep45 was predicted to be a membrane-bound unit of the 14-stranded β-barrel structure.

          <jats:p>
            Producing biobutanol from lignocellulosic biomass has shown promise to ultimately reduce greenhouse gases and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, because of the recalcitrance of a lignocellulosic biomass, a pretreatment of the substrate is needed which in many cases releases soluble lignin compounds (SLCs), which inhibit growth of butanol-producing clostridia. In this study, we found that SLCs changed the acetone/butanol ratio (A/B ratio) during butanol fermentation. The typical A/B molar ratio during

            NCIMB 8052 batch fermentation with glucose as the carbon source is about 0.5. In the present study, the A/B molar ratio during batch fermentation with a lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the carbon source was 0.95 at the end of fermentation. Structural and redox potential changes of the SLCs were characterized before and after fermentation by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and electrochemical analyses, which indicated that some exogenous SLCs were involved in distributing electron flow to

            Bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks to butanol involves pretreatment, during which hundreds of soluble lignin compounds (SLCs) form. Most of these SLCs inhibit growth of solvent-producing clostridia. However, the mechanism by which these compounds modulate electron flow in clostridia remains elusive. In this study, the results revealed that SLCs changed redox balance by producing oxidative stress and modulating electron flow as electron donors. Production of H

            serovar Typhimurium strain DT 104. However, unlike for serovar Typhimurium, a rapid and inexpensive subtyping method has not been available for large-scale surveillance efforts. We developed a phage typing scheme and subtyped 2,523 strains of serovar Heidelberg from outbreaks, sporadic infections, and environmental sources in Canada between January 1991 and December 2000. All strains were sensitive to one or more phages and could be subdivided into 49 phage types. A total of 196 isolates from 13 major outbreaks could be subtyped into six phage types, while 86 strains from family outbreaks were assigned to seven phage types. All strains were typeable, and epidemiologically related strains isolated from patients and implicated foods had identical phage types, antibiograms, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Combining PFGE with phage typing increased the discriminatory power of the analysis beyond that of either method alone. We concluded that this phage typing scheme, in conjunction with PFGE, enhances subtyping of serovar Heidelberg strains. Furthermore, this phage typing scheme is a rapid, economical, stable, and reliable epidemiologic tool for tracing the origin of food-borne disease and for the surveillance of sporadic infections.

          <jats:p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and infection depend on the lipid components of the cell, and replication is inhibited by inhibitors of sphingomyelin biosynthesis. We found that sphingomyelin bound to and activated genotype 1b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by enhancing its template binding activity. Sphingomyelin also bound to 1a and JFH1 (genotype 2a) RdRps but did not activate them. Sphingomyelin did not bind to or activate J6CF (2a) RdRp. The sphingomyelin binding domain (SBD) of HCV RdRp was mapped to the helix-turn-helix structure (residues 231 to 260), which was essential for sphingomyelin binding and activation. Helix structures (residues 231 to 241 and 247 to 260) are important for RdRp activation, and 238S and 248E are important for maintaining the helix structures for template binding and RdRp activation by sphingomyelin. 241Q in helix 1 and the negatively charged 244D at the apex of the turn are important for sphingomyelin binding. Both amino acids are on the surface of the RdRp molecule. The polarity of the phosphocholine of sphingomyelin is important for HCV RdRp activation. However, phosphocholine did not activate RdRp. Twenty sphingomyelin molecules activated one RdRp molecule. The biochemical effect of sphingomyelin on HCV RdRp activity was virologically confirmed by the HCV replicon system. We also found that the SBD was the lipid raft membrane localization domain of HCV NS5B because JFH1 (2a) replicon cells harboring NS5B with the mutation A242C/S244D moved to the lipid raft while the wild type did not localize there. This agreed with the myriocin sensitivity of the mutant replicon.

                APC 3967. Bacteriocins are generally cationic and hydrophobic peptides with antimicrobial activity, which present diverse biotechnological properties of interest for the food industry. Raffinocyclicin inhibits a wide range of bacteria, including foodborne pathogens, and is stable against different treatments which suggest its potential as a natural biopreservative. Whole-genome sequencing and the genetic analysis of the raffinocyclicin gene cluster showed that it is encoded by plasmid that could be used in the future to transfer the ability to produce the bacteriocin to other lactic acid bacteria for industrial applications. These results together highlight the potential of this novel antimicrobial as a biopreservative to be used by the food industry.

They are assembled by the chaperone-usher (CU) pathway of pilus biogenesis involving two proteins, the periplasmic chaperone PapD and the outer membrane assembly platform, PapC. Many aspects of the structural biology of the Pap CU pathway have been elucidated, except for the C-terminal domain of the PapC usher, the structure of which is unknown. In this report, we identify a stable and folded fragment of the C-terminal region of the PapC usher and determine its structure using both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These structures reveal a β-sandwich fold very similar to that of the plug domain, a domain of PapC obstructing its translocation domain. This structural similarity suggests similar functions in usher-mediated pilus biogenesis, playing out at different stages of the process. This structure paves the way for further functional analysis targeting surfaces common to both the plug and the C-terminal domain of PapC.

          <jats:p>
            The roles of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacteria have been debated. Here, the role of five TA systems in regard to biofilm development was investigated (listed as toxin/antitoxin: MazF/MazE, RelE/RelB, ChpB, YoeB/YefM, and YafQ/DinJ). Although these multiple TA systems were reported previously to not impact bacterial fitness, we found that deletion of the five TA systems decreased biofilm formation initially (8 h) on three different surfaces and then increased biofilm formation (24 h) by decreasing biofilm dispersal. Whole-transcriptome profiling revealed that the deletion of the five TA systems induced expression of a single gene,
            <jats:italic>yjgK</jats:italic>
            , which encodes an uncharacterized protein; quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed consistent induction of this gene (at 8, 15, and 24 h). Corroborating the complex phenotype seen upon deleting the TA systems, overexpression of YjgK decreased biofilm formation at 8 h and increased biofilm formation at 24 h; deletion of
            <jats:italic>yjgK</jats:italic>
            also affected biofilm formation in the expected manner by increasing biofilm formation after 8 h and decreasing biofilm formation after 24 h. In addition, YjgK significantly reduced biofilm dispersal. Whole-transcriptome profiling revealed YjgK represses fimbria genes at 8 h (corroborated by qRT-PCR and a yeast agglutination assay), which agrees with the decrease in biofilm formation upon deleting the five TA systems at 8 h, as well as that seen upon overexpressing YjgK. Sand column assays confirmed that deleting the five TA systems reduced cell attachment. Furthermore, deletion of each of the five toxins increased biofilm formation at 8 h, and overexpression of the five toxins repressed biofilm formation at 8 h, a result that is opposite that of deleting all five TA systems; this suggests that complex regulation occurs involving the antitoxins. Also, the ability of the global regulator Hha to reduce biofilm formation was dependent on the presence of these TA systems. Hence, we suggest that one role of TA systems is to influence biofilm formation.

This was done by rational design using prior knowledge from structural homologues together with a recently generated model of the enzyme in question. Three out of four studied mutations increased the hydrolytic reaction rate in an aqueous environment, while none displayed this property in the presence of an alcohol acceptor. This shows that even if the enzyme resides in a separate aqueous phase, the presence of an organic solvent has a great influence. We could also show that a single amino acid replacement in a less studied part of the aglycone subsite, N220F, improves the specificity for transglycosylation 7-fold and thereby increases the potential yield of alkyl glycoside from 17% to 58%.

          <jats:p>The flavivirus genome comprises a single strand of positive-sense RNA, which is translated into a polyprotein and cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to yield functional proteins. One of these, nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), is an enzyme with both serine protease and NTPase/helicase activities. NS3 plays a central role in the flavivirus life cycle: the NS3 N-terminal serine protease together with its essential cofactor NS2B is involved in the processing of the polyprotein, whereas the NS3 C-terminal NTPase/helicase is responsible for ATP-dependent RNA strand separation during replication. An unresolved question remains regarding why NS3 appears to encode two apparently disconnected functionalities within one protein. Here we report the 2.75-Å-resolution crystal structure of full-length Murray Valley encephalitis virus NS3 fused with the protease activation peptide of NS2B. The biochemical characterization of this construct suggests that the protease has little influence on the helicase activity and vice versa. This finding is in agreement with the structural data, revealing a single protein with two essentially segregated globular domains. Comparison of the structure with that of dengue virus type 4 NS2B-NS3 reveals a relative orientation of the two domains that is radically different between the two structures. Our analysis suggests that the relative domain-domain orientation in NS3 is highly variable and dictated by a flexible interdomain linker. The possible implications of this conformational flexibility for the function of NS3 are discussed.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2009,Data/html/10.1128_jvi.00942-09.html,Yes,No,Data/predicted/10.1128_jvi.00942-09.csv,protein,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

            Blue holes are unique marine sinkholes with extreme environments and biogeochemical processes. However, our understanding of community dynamics, functional profiles, and microbial interactions in blue holes remains limited. We studied the extreme environmental response pattern of the microbiome (Symbiodiniaceae, bacteria, archaea, and fungi) across 14 depths in the world’s deepest blue hole, the Sansha Yongle Blue Hole. The α-diversities of Symbiodiniaceae and archaea were stable to extreme environmental conditions, whereas those of bacteria and fungi varied. Physical and nutrient factors primarily influenced the β-diversities of these four microbes, and there were significant differences in microbial communities among water layers. Nine microbial taxa of
            <jats:italic>Cladocopium</jats:italic>
            sp, γ-proteobacteria, Nanoarchaeota, and Ascomycota representing the core microbiome occurred in all water layers. These four microbial groups exhibited potential interactions, with a positive correlation between Symbiodiniaceae and archaea α-diversities. The microbial biogeochemical profiles exhibited notable enrichment characteristics among distinct water layers. Archaea metabolized sulfides in the oxic and upper deep layers, while bacteria dominated sulfide decomposition in the chemocline and lower deep layers. These findings suggest the acclimation of Symbiodiniaceae to an extreme environment may rely on archaea, as a result of a partial niche overlap. The bacterial communities exhibited an environmental response pattern consistent with the Anna Karenina effects, whereas fungal communities displayed an opposite trend. The wide tolerance of the core microbiome to environmental gradients may be linked to evolution, acclimatization, and symbiosis. Bacteria, archaea, and fungi have distinct ecological niches and biogeochemical functions in the Sansha Yongle Blue Hole.

The negative association between the α-diversity and β-diversity of the bacterial community suggested that the change rule of the bacterial community was consistent with the Anna Karenina effects. The core microbiome comprised nine microbial taxa, highlighting their remarkable tolerance and adaptability to sharp environmental gradient variations. Bacteria and archaea played significant roles in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, while fungi contributed to carbon metabolism. This study advanced our understanding of the community dynamics, response patterns, and resilience of microorganisms populating the world’s deepest blue hole, thereby facilitating further ecological and evolutional exploration of microbiomes in diverse extreme environments.</jats:p>

            Tuberculosis (TB) remains the primary cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. The MPT64 antigen assay is an expedited diagnostic method that is increasingly adopted in many TB diagnostic laboratories and clinical settings worldwide. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the MPT64 antigen assay is influenced by the presence of 63bp deletion variants within the
            <jats:italic>mpt64</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            complex (MTBC) remains unverified. In this study, we analyzed the MPT64 antigen assay using isolates from the major lineage and sub-lineage of MTBC combined with whole-genome sequencing. Notably, we found a significant association between the 63bp deletion variant in the
            <jats:italic>mpt64</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            Lineage 4.2.2 (L4.2.2) globally. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that L4.2.2 isolates were divided into two clusters (Clades A and B). Importantly, all isolates within Clade A exhibited the 63bp deletion variant in the
            <jats:italic>mpt64</jats:italic>
            gene. Furthermore, using the Bayesian Skyline population model, we observed that the effective population size of Clade A has remained relatively constant. These findings highlight that MPT64-based testing should be cautiously used, and MPT64 negative results should be validated using an alternative assay in regions where L4.2.2 isolates are prevalent, such as China and Vietnam. These L4.2.2 isolates with the 63bp deletion variant in

              To date, rapid diagnostic methods based on the MPT64 antigen assay are increasingly utilized to differentiate between non-tuberculous mycobacteria and TB disease in clinical settings. Furthermore, numerous novel techniques based on the MPT64 release assay are continuously being developed and applied for the identification of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the MPT64 antigen assay is influenced by the presence of 63 bp deletion variants within the

Previous studies showed that its pathogenesis could be mediated by metabolites from both the host and microbiota. L-Glutamine (Gln) was found to be depleted in intestinal tissues as the main energy source according to previous studies. Hence, we aimed to determine the effects of Gln on EHEC infection and its underlying mode of action.

Besides, our experiments demonstrated that Gln did not induce Shiga-like toxin (Stx) production or cause impairment of gut flora. In conclusion, our study presented evidence that Gln could act against EHEC infection by reducing bacterial virulence and strengthening host defense. Therefore, Gln serves as a promising therapeutic agent for EHEC infection.

This study aims to evaluate the ability of NTS in the detection of pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a prospective study. Fifty CSF specimens collected from 50 patients with suspected CNS infections went through three methods including NTS, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), and microbial culture in parallel. When there was an inconsistency between NTS results and the results of the mNGS, the 16S rDNA gene was amplified followed by Sanger sequencing to further verify pathogens detected by NTS. Among 50 CSF specimens, 76% were NTS-positive, which is lower than mNGS (94.0%), yet higher than microbial culture (16.0%). The overall validation rate, diagnostic accordance rate (DAR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of NTS were 86.7%, 50.0%, 71.0%, 15.8%, 57.9%, and 25.0%, respectively. In the CSF total nucleated cell (TNC) number ≤10 cells/µL, DAR, specificity, and PPV were 20%, 11.1%, and 11.1%, whereas in that with CSF TNC number &gt;10 cells/µL, DAR, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 57.5%, 70.0%, 20.0%, 72.4%, and 18.2%, respectively.

              Chitin degradation is a keystone process in the oceans, mediated by marine microorganisms with the help of several enzymes, mostly chitinases. Sediment, seawater, and filter-feeding marine invertebrates, such as sponges, are known to harbor chitin-degrading bacteria and are presumably hotspots for chitin turnover. Here, we employed an artificial selection process involving enrichment cultures derived from microbial communities associated with the marine sponge
              <jats:italic>Hymeniacidon perlevis</jats:italic>
              , its surrounding seawater and sediment, to select bacterial consortia capable of degrading raw chitin. Throughout the artificial selection process, chitin degradation rates and the taxonomic composition of the four successive enrichment cultures were followed. To the best of our knowledge, chitin degradation was characterized for the first time using size exclusion chromatography, which revealed significant shifts in the numbered average chitin molecular weight, strongly suggesting the involvement of endo-chitinases in the breakdown of the chitin polymer during the enrichment process. Concomitantly with chitin degradation, the enrichment cultures exhibited a decrease in alpha diversity compared with the environmental samples. Notably, some of the dominant taxa in the enriched communities, such as

          <jats:p>Phage therapy, an emerging strategy in the fight against recalcitrant bacterial infections, encounters a significant hurdle posed by the development of phage-resistant bacterial strains. To address this concern, we suggest a novel phage cocktail. By subjecting bacterial strains to a gradual selection process, we isolated and identified three novel phages augmenting one previously isolated phage. This diverse phage set formed the basis of a phage cocktail, displaying enhanced efficacy in curtailing the emergence of phage resistance, particularly evident in the notable stability achieved by three- and four-phage combinations. Our investigation further illuminated distinctive attributes exhibited by phage-resistant mutants: a concomitant reduction in growth rate and virulence offset by a noteworthy escalation in biofilm formation. The therapeutic modality underpinning our approach encompasses both the direct lethality of phages toward bacteria and the intricate landscape of bacterial genetic adaptations. Of intrigue was our observation that bacterial strains previously impervious to a given phage could regain susceptibility following resistance development against an unrelated phage. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential of phage cocktails as an efficacious countermeasure. Consequently, we suggest an innovative approach involving the design of phage cocktails that selectively encompass phages retaining susceptibility to bacteria that have developed resistance to other phages within the cocktail. Furthermore, we advocate for the comprehensive profiling of phage host ranges targeting both resistant strains and wild-type counterparts. The compilation of such intricate host-range data holds the promise of establishing a repository of diverse phages, meticulously tailored for refined and personalized phage therapy interventions.</jats:p>

To achieve this goal, we isolated four phages (U2874, phi_KPN_H2, phi_KPN_S3, and phi_KPN_HS3) that recognized different bacterial surface molecules using phage-resistant bacteria. We constructed three phage cocktails and tested their phage resistance-suppressing ability against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. We argue that the phage cocktail that induces resensitization of phage susceptibility exhibited superior phage resistance-suppressing ability. Moreover, we observed trade-off effects that manifested progressively in phage-resistant bacteria. We hypothesize that such trade-off effects can augment therapeutic efficacy. We also recommend collating phage host range data against phage-resistant mutants in addition to wild-type bacteria when establishing phage banks to improve the efficiency of phage therapy. Our study underscores the importance of phage host range data in constructing effective phage cocktails for clinical use.</jats:p>

              Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disease associated with high androgen and infertility. The gut microbiota plays an important role in metabolic diseases including obesity, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver. Although the gut microbiota has been associated with PCOS, little is known about the gut microbial structure and function in individuals with PCOS from Northeast China. In this study, 17 PCOS individuals and 17 age-matched healthy individuals were recruited for community structure and function analysis of the gut microbiota. The results showed that PCOS individuals have reduced diversity and richness of the gut microbiota compared with healthy individuals. Beta diversity analysis showed that the community structure of the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS was significantly separated from healthy individuals. At the phylum level, PCOS individuals have reduced

              is the predominant pathogen responsible for aspergillosis infections, with emerging drug-resistant strains complicating treatment strategies. The role of mitochondrial functionality in fungal resistance to antifungal agents is well-documented yet not fully understood. In this study, the mitochondrial protein Bcs1A, a homolog of yeast Bcs1, was found to regulate colony growth, ion homeostasis, and the response to antifungal drugs in
              <jats:italic>A. fumigatus</jats:italic>
              . Microscopic observations revealed substantial colocalization of Bcs1A-GFP fusion protein fluorescence with mitochondria. Bcs1A deletion compromised colony growth and the utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources, alongside causing abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced reactive oxygen species production. These findings underscore Bcs1A’s vital role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Phenotypic analysis and determinations of minimum inhibitory concentrations indicated that the Δ
              <jats:italic>bcs1A</jats:italic>
              mutant was more resistant to various antifungal agents, such as azoles, terbinafine, and simvastatin, compared to wild-type strain. RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis highlighted an upregulation of multiple efflux pumps in the Δ
              <jats:italic>bcs1A</jats:italic>
              mutant. Furthermore, loss of the principal drug efflux pump, mdr1, decreased azole tolerance in the Δbcs1A mutant, suggesting that Bcs1A’s modulated of azoles response via efflux pump expression. Collectively, these results establish Bcs1A as essential for growth and antifungal drug responsiveness in

                Drug resistance presents a formidable obstacle in the clinical management of aspergillosis. Mitochondria are integral to various biochemical pathways, including those involved in fungi drug response, making mitochondrial proteins promising therapeutic targets for drug therapy. This study confirms that Bcs1A, a mitochondrial respiratory chain protein, is indispensable for mitochondrial functionality and multidrug tolerance in

              infections are emerging in cystic fibrosis patients, and treatment success rate in these patients is only 33% due to extreme antibiotic resistance. Thus, new treatment options are essential. An interesting target could be Lsr2, a nucleoid-associated protein involved in mycobacterial virulence. Zafirlukast is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug against asthma that was shown to bind Lsr2. In this study, zafirlukast treatment is shown to reduce
              <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
              growth, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 µM and a bactericidal concentration of 64 µM in replicating bacteria only. As an initial response, DNA condensation, a known stress response of mycobacteria, occurs after 1 h of treatment with zafirlukast. During continued zafirlukast treatment, the morphology of the bacteria alters and the structural integrity of the bacteria is lost. After 4 days of treatment, reduced viability is measured in different culture media, and growth of
              <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
              is reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Using transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that the hydrophobic multilayered cell wall and periplasm are disorganized and ribosomes are reduced in size and relocalized. In summary, our data demonstrate that zafirlukast alters the morphology of
              <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
              and is bactericidal at 64 µM. The bactericidal concentration of zafirlukast is relatively high, and it is only effective on replicating bacteria but as zafirlukast is an FDA-approved drug, and currently used as an anti-asthma treatment, it could be an interesting drug to further study in

              Isoniazid is an important first-line medicine to treat tuberculosis (TB). Isoniazid resistance increases the risk of poor treatment outcomes and development of multidrug resistance, and is driven primarily by mutations involving
              <jats:italic>katG</jats:italic>
              , encoding the prodrug-activating enzyme, rather than its validated target, InhA. The chemical tractability of InhA has fostered efforts to discover direct inhibitors of InhA (DIIs). In this study, we bridge the gap in understanding the potential contribution of DIIs to novel combination regimens and demonstrate a clear distinction of DIIs, like GSK693 and the newly described GSK138, from isoniazid, based on activity against clinical isolates and contribution to novel drug regimens. The results suggest that DIIs, specifically GSK138 and GSK693, could be promising partners in novel drug regimens, including those used against isoniazid-resistant TB, potentially enhancing their efficacy and/or preventing the selection of resistant mutants and supporting the continued exploration of InhA as a promising target for TB drug development.

              is primarily due to the acquisition of carbapenemases and is often associated with a diminution of the membrane permeability. The outer membrane protein, OprD, is a well-known route, by which carbapenems, predominantly imipenem, can enter the cell, and its loss has been associated with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. In this study, we investigated the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isogenic

              BEI Resources, a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded program managed by the American Type Culture Collection, serves researchers worldwide through the provision of a centralized repository for the acquisition, production, characterization, preservation, storage, and distribution of standardized biological resources targeting National Institutes of Health priority pathogens including bacteria, viruses, pathogenic fungi, and parasitic protozoa. These reference materials are critical for the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics and are available to qualified registered investigators and institutions worldwide. Bioresources within BEI include well-characterized malaria isolates as part of the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4). These isolates are critical for screening antimalarial compounds, conducting drug resistance studies, and for resistance surveillance and management. In our efforts to enhance the characterization of MR4
              <jats:italic>P. falciparum</jats:italic>
              isolates, we measured antimalarial susceptibility of &gt;100 isolates against a panel of standard antimalarial compounds. Our results provide valuable information to assist current and prospective users of the BEI Resources repository in making data-driven requests of isolates to meet their research needs.

              Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a valuable tool for monitoring respiratory viral diseases within communities by analyzing concentrations of viral nucleic-acids in wastewater. However, little is known about the fate of respiratory virus nucleic-acids in wastewater. Two important fate processes that may modulate their concentrations in wastewater as they move from household drains to the point of collection include sorption or partitioning to wastewater solids and degradation. This study investigated the decay kinetics of genomic nucleic-acids of seven human respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, human rhinovirus (HRV), and influenza A virus (IAV), as well as pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) in wastewater solids. Viruses (except for PMMoV) were spiked into wastewater solids and their concentrations were followed for 50 days at three different temperatures (4°C, 22°C, and 37°C). Viral genomic RNA decayed following first-order kinetics with decay rate constants
              <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>
              from 0 to 0.219 per day. Decay rate constants
              <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>
              were not different from 0 for all targets in solids incubated at 4°C;
              <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>
              values were largest at 37°C and at this temperature,
              <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>
              values were similar across nucleic-acid targets. Regardless of temperature, there was limited viral RNA decay, with an estimated 0% to 20% reduction, over the typical residence times of sewage in the piped systems between input and collection point (&lt;1 day). The

            -glycoside-3-oxidase (CGOx) are both members of the glucose-methanol-choline superfamily of oxidoreductases and belong to the same sequence space. Pyranose oxidases had been studied for their oxidation of monosaccharides such as D-glucose, but recently, a bacterial
            <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>

            -glycosides such as carminic acid, mangiferin or puerarin has been described. Since these actinobacterial CGOx enzymes belong to the same sequence space as bacterial POx, they must have evolved from the same ancestor. Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of actinobacterial sequences and resurrected seven ancestral enzymes of the POx/CGOx sequence space to study the evolutionary trajectory of substrate preferences for monosaccharides and
            <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Kitasatospora aureofaciens</jats:italic>
            , shows strict preference for monosaccharides (D-glucose and D-xylose) and does not react with any of the glycosides tested. No extant member of clade II has been studied to date. The two extant members of clades III and IV, monomeric POx/CGOx from
            <jats:italic>Pseudoarthrobacter siccitolerans</jats:italic>
            and

            <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>
            -glycosides (homoorientin, isovitexin, mangiferin, and puerarin). Steady-state kinetic parameters of several clades III and IV ancestral enzymes indicate that the generalist ancestor N35 slowly evolved to present-day enzymes with a much higher preference for
            <jats:italic>C</jats:italic>
            -glycosides than monosaccharides. Based on structural predictions of ancestors, we hypothesize that the strict specificity of bacterial clade I POx (and also fungal POx) is the result of oligomerization, which in turn results from the evolution of protein segments that were shown to be important for oligomerization, the arm, and the head domain.

              Given the vast quantity of oil and gas input to the marine environment annually, hydrocarbon degradation by marine microorganisms is an essential ecosystem service. Linkages between taxonomy and hydrocarbon degradation capabilities are largely based on cultivation studies, leaving a knowledge gap regarding the intrinsic ability of uncultured marine microbes to degrade hydrocarbons. To address this knowledge gap, metagenomic sequence data from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill deep-sea plume was assembled to which metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were mapped. Assembly and binning produced new DWH metagenome-assembled genomes that were evaluated along with their close relatives, all of which are from the marine environment (38 total). These analyses revealed globally distributed hydrocarbon-degrading microbes with clade-specific substrate degradation potentials that have not been reported previously. For example, methane oxidation capabilities were identified in all
              <jats:italic>Cycloclasticus</jats:italic>
              . Furthermore, all
              <jats:italic>Bermanella</jats:italic>
              encoded and expressed genes for non-gaseous
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              -alkane degradation; however, DWH
              <jats:italic>Bermanella</jats:italic>
              encoded alkane hydroxylase, not alkane 1-monooxygenase. All but one previously unrecognized DWH plume member in the SAR324 and UBA11654 have the capacity for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. In contrast,
              <jats:italic>Colwellia</jats:italic>
              were diverse in the hydrocarbon substrates they could degrade. All clades encoded nutrient acquisition strategies and response to cold temperatures, while sensory and acquisition capabilities were clade specific. These novel insights regarding hydrocarbon degradation by uncultured planktonic microbes provides missing data, allowing for better prediction of the fate of oil and gas when hydrocarbons are input to the ocean, leading to a greater understanding of the ecological consequences to the marine environment.

              <jats:p>Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons is a critically important process promoting ecosystem health, yet much of what is known about this process is based on physiological experiments with a few hydrocarbon substrates and cultured microbes. Thus, the ability to degrade the diversity of hydrocarbons that comprise oil and gas by microbes in the environment, particularly in the ocean, is not well characterized. Therefore, this study aimed to utilize non-cultivation-based ‘omics data to explore novel genomes of uncultured marine microbes involved in degradation of oil and gas. Analyses of newly assembled metagenomic data and previously existing genomes from other marine data sets, with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic read recruitment, revealed globally distributed hydrocarbon-degrading marine microbes with clade-specific substrate degradation potentials that have not been previously reported. This new understanding of oil and gas degradation by uncultured marine microbes suggested that the global ocean harbors a diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, which can act as primary agents regulating ecosystem health.</jats:p>

            are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. Despite frequent co-infections in patients, few studies have investigated how mono-infections may differ from co-infections. We hypothesized that a symbiotic relationship between the pathogens could account for the high rates of clinical co-infection. During

            <jats:italic>N. gonorrhoeae. C. trachomatis</jats:italic>
            is an obligate intracellular pathogen with a unique biphasic developmental cycle progressing from infectious elementary bodies (EB) to replicative reticulate bodies (RB), and back. After 12 hours of co-infection, we observed fewer EBs than in a mono-infection. Chlamydial genome copy number remained equivalent between mono- and co-infections. This is a hallmark of Chlamydial persistence. Chlamydial persistence alters inclusion morphology but varies depending on the stimulus/stress. We observed larger, but fewer,
            <jats:italic>Chlamydia</jats:italic>
            during co-infection. Tryptophan depletion can induce Chlamydial persistence, but tryptophan supplementation did not reverse the co-infection phenotype. Only viable and actively growing
            <jats:italic>N. gonorrhoeae</jats:italic>
            produced the inhibition phenotype in

              Ethanolamine (EA) affects the colonization and pathogenicity of certain human bacterial pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. However, EA can also affect the intracellular survival and replication of host cell invasive bacteria such as
              <jats:italic>Listeria monocytogenes</jats:italic>
              (LMO) and
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>
              serovar Typhimurium (
              <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>
              . Typhimurium). The EA utilization (
              <jats:italic>eut</jats:italic>
              ) genes can be categorized as regulatory, enzymatic, or structural, and previous work in LMO showed that loss of genes encoding functions for the enzymatic breakdown of EA inhibited LMO intracellular replication. In this work, we sought to further characterize the role of EA utilization during LMO infection of host cells. Unlike what was previously observed for
              <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>
              . Typhimurium, in LMO, an EA regulator mutant (
              <jats:italic>ΔeutV</jats:italic>
              ) was equally deficient in intracellular replication compared to an EA metabolism mutant (
              <jats:italic>ΔeutB</jats:italic>
              )
              <jats:italic>,</jats:italic>
              and this was consistent across Caco-2, RAW 264.7, and THP-1 cell lines. The structural genes encode proteins that self-assemble into bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) that encase the enzymes necessary for EA metabolism. For the first time, native EUT BMCs were fluorescently tagged, and EUT BMC formation was observed
              <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              . Interestingly, BMC formation was observed in bacteria infecting Caco-2 cells, but not the macrophage cell lines. Finally, the cellular immune response of Caco-2 cells to infection with
              <jats:italic>eut</jats:italic>
              mutants was examined, and it was discovered that
              <jats:italic>ΔeutB</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>ΔeutV</jats:italic>
              mutants similarly elevated the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, EA sensing and utilization during LMO intracellular infection are important for optimal LMO replication and immune evasion but are not always concomitant with BMC formation.

                (LMO) is a bacterial pathogen that can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals when consumed in contaminated food. It can replicate inside of mammalian cells, escaping detection by the immune system. Therefore, understanding the features of this human pathogen that contribute to its infectiousness and intracellular lifestyle is important. In this work we demonstrate that genes encoding both regulators and enzymes of EA metabolism are important for optimal growth inside mammalian cells. Moreover, the formation of specialized compartments to enable EA metabolism were visualized by tagging with a fluorescent protein and found to form when LMO infects some mammalian cell types, but not others. Interestingly, the formation of the compartments was associated with features consistent with an early stage of the intracellular infection. By characterizing bacterial metabolic pathways that contribute to survival in host environments, we hope to positively impact knowledge and facilitate new treatment strategies.

              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              infection has never been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the host-pathogen interaction of
              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              infection with the human alveolar macrophage and to determine the role of flagellin in modulating inflammasome-mediated pathways. We found that
              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              infects primary human alveolar macrophages but is gradually restricted in the setting of concurrent cell death. Electron microscopy revealed cytosolic bacteria undergoing division, indicating that
              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              likely escapes the alveolar macrophage phagosome and may replicate in the cytosol, where it triggers immune responses. In paired human blood monocytes, uptake and intracellular restriction of
              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              are similar to those observed in alveolar macrophages, but cell death is reduced. The alveolar macrophage cytokine response to
              <jats:italic>B. pseudomallei</jats:italic>
              is characterized by marked interleukin (IL)-18 secretion compared to monocytes. Both cytotoxicity and IL-18 secretion in alveolar macrophages are partially flagellin dependent. However, the proportion of IL-18 release that is driven by flagellin is greater in alveolar macrophages than in monocytes. These findings suggest differential flagellin-mediated inflammasome pathway activation in the human alveolar macrophage response to

              The Pel exopolysaccharide is one of the most mechanistically conserved and phylogenetically diverse bacterial biofilm matrix determinants. Pel is a major contributor to the structural integrity of
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              biofilms, and its biosynthesis is regulated by the binding of cyclic-3′,5′-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) to the PelD receptor. c-di-GMP is synthesized from two molecules of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by diguanylate cyclases with GGDEF domains and degraded by phosphodiesterases with EAL or HD-GYP domains. As the
              <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              genome encodes 43 c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes, one way signaling specificity can be achieved is through direct interaction between specific enzyme-receptor pairs. Here, we show that the inner membrane hybrid GGDEF-EAL enzyme, BifA, directly interacts with PelD via its cytoplasmic HAMP, GGDEF, and EAL domains. Despite having no catalytic function, the degenerate active site motif of the BifA GGDEF domain (GGDQF) has retained the ability to bind GTP with micromolar affinity. Mutations that abolish GTP binding result in increased biofilm formation but stable global c-di-GMP levels. Our data suggest that BifA forms a dimer in solution and that GTP binding induces conformational changes in dimeric BifA that enhance the BifA-PelD interaction and stimulate its phosphodiesterase activity, thus reducing c-di-GMP levels and downregulating Pel biosynthesis. Structural comparisons between the dimeric AlphaFold2 model of BifA and the structures of other hybrid GGDEF-EAL proteins suggest that the regulation of BifA by GTP may occur through a novel mechanism.

              c-di-GMP is the most common cyclic dinucleotide used by bacteria to regulate phenotypes such as motility, biofilm formation, virulence factor production, cell cycle progression, and cell differentiation. While the identification and initial characterization of c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes are well established, our understanding of how these enzymes are regulated to provide signaling specificity remains understudied. Here we demonstrate that the inactive GGDEF domain of BifA binds GTP and regulates the adjacent phosphodiesterase EAL domain, ultimately downregulating Pel-dependent
              <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              biofilm formation through an interaction with PelD. This discovery adds to the growing body of literature regarding how hybrid GGDEF-EAL enzymes are regulated and provides additional precedence for studying how direct interactions between c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes and effectors result in signaling specificity.

              expression, ranging from ~3% to almost 200% of the wild-type transcript level, but all showing a reduction in PSI levels, relative to wild type, suggesting a role of the

In contrast, mutant strains with &lt;10% of the wild-type level of PSI were obligate photoheterotrophs. Variable fluorescence yields of all mutants were much higher than those of wild type, indicating that the PSI content is localized differently than in wild type, with less transfer of PSII-absorbed energy to PSI. Strains with less PSI saturate at a higher light intensity, enhancing productivity at higher light intensities. This is similar to what is found in mutants with reduced antennae.

              Chromosome segregation in bacteria is a critical process ensuring that each daughter cell receives an accurate copy of the genetic material during cell division. Active segregation factors, such as the ParABS system or SMC complexes, are usually essential for this process, but they are surprisingly dispensable in

              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              imaging, and biochemical approaches, we dissected the molecular features of RocS involved in chromosome segregation. We investigated the respective functions of the three RocS domains, specifically the C-terminal amphipathic helix (AH), the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the coiled-coil domain (CCD) separating the AH and the DBD. Notably, we found that a single AH is not sufficient for membrane binding and that RocS requires prior oligomerization to interact with the membrane. We further demonstrated that this self-interaction was driven by the N-terminal part of the CCD. On the other hand, we revealed that the C-terminal part of the CCD corresponds to a domain of unknown function (DUF 536) and is defined by three conserved glutamines, which play a crucial role in RocS-mediated chromosome segregation. Finally, we showed that the DBD is phosphorylated by the unique serine-threonine kinase of
              <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              StkP and that mimicking this phosphorylation abrogated RocS binding to DNA. Overall, this study offers new insights into chromosome segregation in Streptococci and paves the way for a deeper understanding of RocS-like proteins in other bacteria.

                Bacteria have evolved a variety of mechanisms to properly segregate their genetic material during cell division. In this study, we performed a molecular dissection of the chromosome partitioning protein Regulator of Chromosome Segregation (RocS), a pillar element of chromosome segregation in
                <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
                that is also generally conserved in the

                family. Our systematic investigation sheds light on the molecular features required for successful pneumococcal chromosome segregation and the regulation of RocS by phosphorylation. In addition, our study also revealed that RocS shares functional domains with the Par protein, involved in an atypical plasmid segregation system. Therefore, we expect that our findings may serve to extend our understanding of RocS and RocS-like proteins while broadening the repertoire of partitioning systems used in bacteria.

              Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by some Gram-positive bacteria. Daptomycin disrupts synthesis of the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall by inserting into the cytoplasmic membrane and binding multiple forms of the undecaprenyl carrier lipid required for PG synthesis. Membrane insertion requires phosphatidylglycerol, so studies of daptomycin can provide insight into assembly and maintenance of the cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we studied the effects of daptomycin on
              <jats:italic>Clostridioides difficile</jats:italic>

We also selected for and characterized eight mutants with elevated daptomycin resistance. The mutations in these mutants were mapped to four genes:

              Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is life-threatening for immunocompromised patients. Quantitative molecular assays on whole blood or plasma are the gold standard for the diagnosis of invasive HCMV infection and for monitoring antiviral treatment in individuals at risk of HCMV disease. For these reasons, an accurate standardization toward the WHO 1st International Standard among different centers and diagnostic kits represents an effort for better clinical management of HCMV-positive patients. Herein, we evaluate, for the first time, the performance of a new transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay versus quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) chemistry, used as a routine method, on whole blood samples. A total of 755 clinical whole blood specimens were collected and tested simultaneously with TMA and qPCR assays. The data showed a qualitative agreement of 99.27% for positive quantified samples and 89.39% for those undetected between the two tested methods. Evaluation of viremia in positive samples highlighted a good correlation between TMA and qPCR chemistries in terms of International Units (ΔLog
              <jats:sub>10</jats:sub>
              IU/mL: −0.29 ± 0.40). The TMA assay showed a significant correlation with qPCR in patients monitored for up to 3 months, thus allowing an accurate assessment of viremia in transplant patients. Therefore, TMA chemistry showed good agreement with qPCR testing, used as a current diagnostic routine. It also offers important advantages, such as FDA approval on plasma and

              Diagnostic (IVD) on both plasma and whole blood, automated workflow with minimal hands-on time, and random access loading, thus enabling a rapid and reliable diagnostic in HCMV-infected patients.

              Manual microscopy of Gram stains from positive blood cultures (PBCs) is crucial for diagnosing bloodstream infections but remains labor intensive, time consuming, and subjective. This study aimed to evaluate a scan and analysis system that combines fully automated digital microscopy with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assist the interpretation of Gram stains from PBCs for routine laboratory use. The CNN was trained to classify images of Gram stains based on staining and morphology into seven different classes: background/false-positive, Gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCCL), Gram-positive cocci in pairs (GPCP), Gram-positive cocci in chains (GPCC), rod-shaped bacilli (RSB), yeasts, and polymicrobial specimens. A total of 1,555 Gram-stained slides of PBCs were scanned, pre-classified, and reviewed by medical professionals. The results of assisted Gram stain interpretation were compared to those of manual microscopy and cultural species identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The comparison of assisted Gram stain interpretation and manual microscopy yielded positive/negative percent agreement values of 95.8%/98.0% (GPCCL), 87.6%/99.3% (GPCP/GPCC), 97.4%/97.8% (RSB), 83.3%/99.3% (yeasts), and 87.0%/98.5% (negative/false positive). The assisted Gram stain interpretation, when compared to MALDI-TOF MS species identification, also yielded similar results. During the analytical performance study, assisted interpretation showed excellent reproducibility and repeatability. Any microorganism in PBCs should be detectable at the determined limit of detection of 10
              <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
              CFU/mL. Although the CNN-based interpretation of Gram stains from PBCs is not yet ready for clinical implementation, it has potential for future integration and advancement.

              It has become increasingly important for microbiology educators to help students learn critical concepts of the discipline. This is particularly true in virology, where current challenges include increasing rates of vaccine hesitancy, misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, and controversy surrounding research on pathogens with pandemic potential. Having students learn virology can attract more people to the field and increase the number of people who can engage in meaningful discourse about issues relating to the discipline. However, the limited number of virologists who teach undergraduates, combined with the fact that many institutions lack stand-alone virology courses, results in virology often being taught as a limited number of lectures within an undergraduate microbiology course (if it is covered at all), which may or may not be taught by an individual trained as a virologist. To provide a framework to teach virology to undergraduate students, a team of virology educators, with support from the American Society for Virology (ASV), developed curriculum guidelines for use in a stand-alone undergraduate virology course or a virology section within another course (D. B. Kushner et al., J Virol 96:e01305-22, 2022,

              ). These guidelines are available at the ASV website (

              ). To assist educators in implementing these guidelines, we created examples of measurable learning objectives. This perspective provides details about the virology curriculum guidelines and learning objectives and accompanies the perspective by Boury et al. in this issue of the

A comprehensive synthesis exploring the teaching practices within the course and how those practices are evaluated is warranted. This scoping literature review identified 78 journal articles investigating teaching practices, and we charted their research methods, student outcomes, and institutional contexts. Content analysis found the teaching practices described most frequently in A&amp;P education research literature involved multiple aligned changes across the curriculum, including student activities, course delivery, and assessments. Critical appraisal of study methodologies revealed that most studies in undergraduate A&amp;P were longitudinal, included comparison groups, and used simple inferential statistics. In contrast, few studies listed limitations of their research, collected data from multiple institutions, or reported student demographic data. We believe these factors pose notable limitations to the interpretation of A&amp;P education studies across institutional contexts. The results of this review identify future lines of inquiry to enrich existing evidence about pedagogical interventions in A&amp;P courses.</jats:p>

            genus and posing global public health concerns. Although human infection by these viruses is mainly asymptomatic, both have been associated with neurological disorders such as encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Since USUV and WNV are transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, the skin represents the initial site of virus inoculation and provides the first line of host defense. Although some data on the early stages of WNV skin infection are available, very little is known about USUV. Herein, USUV-skin resident cell interactions were characterized. Using primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, an early replication of USUV during the first 24 hours was shown in both skin cells. In human skin explants, a high viral tropism for keratinocytes was observed. USUV infection of these models induced type I and III interferon responses associated with upregulated expression of various interferon-stimulated genes as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes. Among the four USUV lineages studied, the Europe 2 strain replicated more efficiently in skin cells and induced a higher innate immune response.
            <jats:italic>In vivo</jats:italic>
            , USUV and WNV disseminated quickly from the inoculation site to distal cutaneous tissues. In addition, viral replication and persistence in skin cells were associated with an antiviral response. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the early steps of USUV infection and suggest that the skin constitutes a major amplifying organ for USUV and WNV infection.

              transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Since they are directly inoculated within the upper skin layers, the interactions between the virus and skin cells are critical in the pathophysiology of USUV and WNV infection. Here, during the early steps of infection, we showed that USUV can efficiently infect two human resident skin cell types at the inoculation site: the epidermal keratinocytes and the dermal fibroblasts, leading to the induction of an antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, following cutaneous inoculation, we demonstrated that both viruses can rapidly spread, replicate, and persist in all distal cutaneous tissues in mice, a phenomenon associated with a generalized skin inflammatory response. These results highlight the key amplifying and immunological role of the skin during USUV and WNV infection.

            White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the largest animal DNA viruses in terms of its genome size and has caused huge economic losses in the farming of crustaceans such as shrimp and crayfish. Detailed knowledge of WSSV-host interactions is still lacking, particularly regarding viral escape from host immune clearance. Intriguingly, we found that the presence of WSSV-VP26 might inhibit the autophagic degradation of WSSV
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            in the crustacean species red claw crayfish. Importantly, this study is the first to show that viral protein VP26 functions as a core factor to benefit WSSV escape by disrupting the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which is necessary for the proposed fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes for subsequent degradation. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of DNA virus evasion by blocking SNARE complex assembly and identify viral VP26 as a key candidate for anti-WSSV targeting.

              Vector competence defines the ability of a vector to acquire, host, and transmit a pathogen. Understanding the molecular determinants of the mosquitos’ competence to host dengue virus (DENV) holds promise to prevent its transmission. To this end, we employed RNA-seq to profile mRNA transcripts of the female
              <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>
              mosquitos feeding on naïve vs viremic mouse. While most transcripts (12,634) did not change their abundances, 360 transcripts showed decreases. Biological pathway analysis revealed representatives of the decreased transcripts involved in the wnt signaling pathway and hippo signaling pathway. One thousand three hundred fourteen transcripts showed increases in abundance and participate in 21 biological pathways including amino acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation with antimycin A reduced oxidative phosphorylation activity and ATP concentration associated with reduced DENV replication in the
              <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>
              cells. Antimycin A did not affect the amounts of the non-structural proteins 3 and 5, two major components of the replication complex. Ribavirin, an agent that reduces GTP concentration, recapitulated the effects of reduced ATP concentration on DENV replication. Knocking down one of the oxidative phosphorylation components, ATP synthase subunit β, reduced DENV replication in the mosquitos. In summary, our results suggest that DENV enhances metabolic pathways in the female
              <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti</jats:italic>
              mosquitos to supply nutrients and energy for virus replication. ATP synthase subunit β knockdown might be exploited to reduce the mosquitos’ competence to host and transmit DENV.

Disruption in the mosquitos’ ability to host these viruses offers strategies to prevent diseases caused by them. With the advent of genomic tools, we discovered that dengue virus (DENV) benefited from the female mosquitos’ bloodmeals for metabolic and energetic supplies for replication. Chemical or genetic disruption in these supplies reduced DENV replication in the female mosquitos. Our discovery can be exploited to produce genetically modified mosquitos, in which DENV infection leads to disruption in the supplies and thereby reduces replication and transmission. Our discovery might be extrapolated to prevent mosquito-borne virus transmission and the diseases they cause.</jats:p>

However, the effect of fusion (F) protein-interacting partners on PPRV infection is poorly understood. In this study, we found that the expression of goat plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) gradually decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in PPRV-infected goat alveolar macrophages (GAMs). Goat PLAU was subsequently identified using co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy as an F protein binding partner. The overexpression of goat PLAU inhibited PPRV growth and replication, whereas silencing goat PLAU promoted viral growth and replication. Additionally, we confirmed that goat PLAU interacted with a virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) to antagonize F-mediated VISA degradation, increasing the production of type I interferon. We also found that goat PLAU reduced the inhibition of PPRV replication in VISA-knockdown GAMs. Our results show that the host protein PLAU inhibits the growth and replication of PPRV by VISA-triggering RIG-I-like receptors and provides insight into the host protein that antagonizes PPRV immunosuppression.</jats:p>

              Amoebae are environmental predators feeding on bacteria, fungi, and other eukaryotic microbes. Predatory interactions alter microbial communities and impose selective pressure toward phagocytic resistance or escape which may, in turn, foster virulence attributes. The ubiquitous fungivorous amoeba
              <jats:italic>Protostelium aurantium</jats:italic>
              has a wide prey spectrum in the fungal kingdom but discriminates against members of the

              <jats:italic>Candida glabrata</jats:italic>
              . Here, we show that this prey discrimination among fungi is solely based on the presence of ubiquinone as an essential cofactor for the predator. While the amoeba readily fed on fungi with CoQ presenting longer isoprenyl side chain variants CoQ8-10, such as those from the
              <jats:italic>Candida</jats:italic>

To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing of heteroresistant bacteria, which revealed global gene expression changes and a signature of the CpxRA cell envelope stress response. Deletion of the
              <jats:italic>cpxRA</jats:italic>

              Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the infectious diseases with high incidence and high mortality. About a quarter of the population has been latently infected with
              <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
              . At present, the available TB treatment strategies have the disadvantages of too long treatment duration and serious adverse reactions. The sustained inflammatory response leads to permanent tissue damage. Unfortunately, the current selection of treatment regimens does not consider the immunomodulatory effects of various drugs. In this study, we preliminarily evaluated the effects of commonly used anti-tuberculosis drugs on innate immunity at the cellular level. The results showed that clofazimine (CFZ) has a significant innate immunosuppressive effect. CFZ significantly inhibited cytokines and type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ) expression under both lipopolysaccharide stimulation and CFZ-resistant strain infection. In further mechanistic studies, CFZ strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of p38. In conclusion, our study found that CFZ suppresses innate immunity against
              <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
              by NF-κB, which should be considered in future regimen development.

The excessive immune inflammatory response of the host for a long time causes irreversible organic damage to the lungs and liver. Current antibiotic-based treatment options involve multiple complex drug combinations, often targeting different physiological processes of Mtb. Given the high incidence of post-tuberculosis lung disease, we should also consider the immunomodulatory properties of other drugs when selecting drug combinations.

              Fimbriae are essential virulence factors for many bacterial pathogens. Fimbriae are extracellular structures that attach bacteria to surfaces. Thus, fimbriae mediate a critical step required for any pathogen to establish infection by anchoring a bacterium to host tissue. The human pathogen enterohemorrhagic
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              (EHEC) O157:H7encodes 16 fimbriae that may be important for EHEC to initiate infection and allow for productive expression of virulence traits important in later stages of infection, including a type III secretion system (T3SS) and Shiga toxin; however, the roles of most EHEC fimbriae are largely uncharacterized. Here, we provide evidence that two EHEC fimbriae, Yad and Yeh, modulate expression of diverse genes including genes encoding T3SS and Shiga toxin and that these fimbriae are required for robust colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. These findings reveal a significant and previously unappreciated role for fimbriae in bacterial pathogenesis as important determinants of virulence gene expression.

                Fimbriae are extracellular proteinaceous structures whose defining role is to anchor bacteria to surfaces. This is a fundamental step for bacterial pathogens to establish infection in a host. Here, we show that the contributions of fimbriae to pathogenesis are more complex. Specifically, we demonstrate that fimbriae influence expression of virulence traits essential for disease progression in the intestinal pathogen enterohemorrhagic
                <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
                . Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria express multiple fimbriae; therefore, these findings may have broad implications for understanding how pathogens use fimbriae, beyond adhesion, to initiate infection and coordinate gene expression, which ultimately results in disease.

Nevertheless, tracking AMR within a community proves challenging due to the substantial sample size required for a representative population, along with high associated costs and privacy concerns.

This perspective contributes valuable insights into trends of AMR carriage, emphasizing the importance of wastewater surveillance in informing effective public health interventions.

              <jats:italic>Bth</jats:italic>
              responds to β-lactam treatment differently depending on the metabolic environment both

              and
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              . Studies of other bacteria show that an increase in respiratory metabolism independent of growth rate promotes susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics. We propose that
              <jats:italic>Bth</jats:italic>
              enters a protected state linked to an increase in polysaccharide utilization and a decrease in the use of simple sugars. Here, we apply antibiotic susceptibility testing, transcriptomic analysis, and genetic manipulation to characterize this polysaccharide-mediated tolerance (PM tolerance) phenotype. We found that a variety of mono- and disaccharides increased the susceptibility of
              <jats:italic>Bth</jats:italic>
              to several different β-lactams compared to polysaccharides. Transcriptomics indicated a metabolic shift from reductive to oxidative branches of the tricarboxylic acid cycle on polysaccharides. Accordingly, supplementation with intermediates of central carbon metabolism had varying effects on PM tolerance. Transcriptional analysis also showed a decrease in the expression of the electron transport chain (ETC) protein NQR and an increase in the ETC protein NUO, when given fiber versus glucose. Deletion of NQR increased
              <jats:italic>Bth</jats:italic>
              susceptibility while deletion of NUO and a third ETC protein NDH2 had no effect. This work confirms that carbon source utilization modulates antibiotic susceptibility in
              <jats:italic>Bth</jats:italic>
              and that anaerobic respiratory metabolism and the ETC play an essential role.

                Antibiotics are indispensable medications that revolutionized modern medicine. However, their effectiveness is challenged by a large array of resistance and tolerance mechanisms. Treatment with antibiotics also disrupts the gut microbiome which can adversely affect health.
                <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>
                are prevalent in the gut microbiome and yet are frequently involved in anaerobic infections. Thus, understanding how antibiotics affect these bacteria is necessary to implement proper treatment. Recent work has investigated the role of metabolism in antibiotic susceptibility in distantly related bacteria such as
                <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
                . Using antibiotic susceptibility testing, transcriptomics, and genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that polysaccharides reduce β-lactam susceptibility when compared to monosaccharides. This finding underscores the profound impact of metabolic adaptation on the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. In the long term, this work indicates that modulation of metabolism could make
                <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>
                more susceptible during infections or protect them in the context of the microbiome.

            ) and host proteases. However, the impact of host proteases on DENV proliferation is not well understood. In this study, we utilized fluorophosphonate-based probes (FPs) to investigate the up-regulation of host serine proteases during DENV infection in detail. Among the identified proteases, acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (ACOT2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes acyl-CoA molecules to generate fatty acids and free CoA, exhibited cleavage activity against DENV polypeptide substrates. Enzymatic assays and virological experiments confirmed that ACOT2 contributes to DENV propagation during the replication stage by cleaving the viral polyprotein. Docking models provided insights into the binding pocket of viral polypeptides and the catalytic mechanism of ACOT2. Notably, this study is the first to demonstrate that ACOT2 functions as a serine protease to hydrolyze protein substrates. These findings offer novel insights into DENV infection, host response, as well as the potential development of innovative antiviral strategies.

            <jats:p>DENV, one of the major pathogens of Dengue fever, remains a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. How DENV efficiently hijacks the host and accesses its life cycle with delicate interaction remains to be elucidated. Here, we deconvoluted that the host protease ACOT2 assists the DENV replication and characterized the ACOT2 as a serine protease involved in the hydrolysis of the DENV polypeptide substrate. Our results not only further the understanding of the DENV life cycle but also provide a possibility for the usage of activity-based proteomics to reveal host-virus interactions.</jats:p>

              To date, many viruses have been discovered to infect honey bees. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to expand the known virome of the honey bee,
              <jats:italic>Apis mellifera</jats:italic>
              , by identifying several novel DNA viruses. While the majority of previously identified bee viruses are RNA, our study reveals nine new genomes from the
              <jats:italic>Parvoviridae</jats:italic>
              family, tentatively named Bee densoviruses 1 to 9. In addition, we characterized a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous-like virus (AmFLV), which shares limited protein identities with the known Apis mellifera filamentous virus. The complete sequence of AmFLV, obtained by a combination of laboratory techniques and bioinformatics, spans 152,678 bp. Linear dsDNA genome encodes for 112 proteins, of which 49 are annotated. Another large virus we discovered is Apis mellifera nudivirus, which belongs to a group of
              <jats:italic>Alphanudivirus</jats:italic>
              . The virus has a length of 129,467 bp and a circular dsDNA genome, and has 106 protein encoding genes. The virus contains most of the core genes of the family
              <jats:italic>Nudiviridae</jats:italic>

              In low-microbial biomass samples such as bovine milk, contaminants can outnumber endogenous bacteria. Because of this, milk microbiome research suffers from a critical knowledge gap, namely, does non-mastitis bovine milk contain a native microbiome? In this study, we sampled external and internal mammary epithelia and stripped and cisternal milk and used numerous negative controls, including air and sampling controls and extraction and library preparation blanks, to identify the potential sources of contamination. Two algorithms were used to mathematically remove contaminants and track the potential movement of microbes among samples. Results suggest that the majority (i.e., &gt;75%) of sequence data generated from bovine milk and mammary epithelium samples represents contaminating DNA. Contaminants in milk samples were primarily sourced from DNA extraction kits and the internal and external skin of the teat, while teat canal and apex samples were mainly contaminated during the sampling process. After decontamination, the milk microbiome displayed a more dispersed, less diverse, and compositionally distinct bacterial profile compared with epithelial samples. Similar microbial compositions were observed between cisternal and stripped milk samples, as well as between teat apex and canal samples.
              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus</jats:italic>

              spp. in 7% (1/14) of cisternal milk samples. Our study suggests that microbiome data generated from milk samples obtained from clinically healthy bovine udders may be heavily biased by contaminants that enter the sample during sample collection and processing workflows.

              <jats:p>Obtaining a non-contaminated sample of bovine milk is challenging due to the nature of the sampling environment and the route by which milk is typically extracted from the mammary gland. Furthermore, the very low bacterial biomass of bovine milk exacerbates the impacts of contaminant sequences in downstream analyses, which can lead to severe biases. Our finding showed that bovine milk contains very low bacterial biomass and each contamination event (including sampling procedure and DNA extraction process) introduces bacteria and/or DNA fragments that easily outnumber the native bacterial cells. This finding has important implications for our ability to draw robust conclusions from milk microbiome data, especially if the data have not been subjected to rigorous decontamination procedures. Based on these findings, we strongly urge researchers to include numerous negative controls into their sampling and sample processing workflows and to utilize several complementary methods for identifying potential contaminants within the resulting sequence data. These measures will improve the accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, and interpretability of milk microbiome data and research.</jats:p>

We conclude that purposeful strain screening and selection efforts can be used to identify unique probiotic strains that possess specially desired mechanisms of action.

              The ruminant-microorganism symbiosis is unique by providing high-quality food from fibrous materials but also contributes to the production of one of the most potent greenhouse gases—methane. Mitigating methanogenesis in ruminants has been a focus of interest in the past decades. One of the promising strategies to combat methane production is the use of feed supplements, such as seaweeds, that might mitigate methanogenesis via microbiome modulation and direct chemical inhibition. We conducted

              investigations of the effect of three seaweeds (

We applied metataxonomics (16S rRNA gene amplicons) and metagenomics (shotgun) methods to uncover the interplay between the microbiome’s taxonomical and functional states, methanogenesis rates, and seaweed supplementations.

              (ACB) complex has been identified as a group of emerging opportunistic pathogens that cause nosocomial infections. The current study investigates the prevalence, distribution, and diversity of pathogenic ACB complex in various aquatic systems with different uses. Of the total 157 agricultural, raw drinking water intake, recreational beach, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent samples, acinetobacters were isolated, quantified, and confirmed by genus- and ACB complex-specific PCR assays. Of all agricultural surface water samples,
              <jats:italic>A. calcoaceticus</jats:italic>

              in WWTP effluent samples, overall, the prevalence of ACB complex in all sampling locations and seasons indicates that these water sources, containing human-associated ACB complex, may pose potential health risks as community-acquired opportunistic infections.

                <jats:italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii</jats:italic>
                complex species remain poorly understood, and there is a need to better understand the occurrence of

                in non-nosocomial environments. Our research details the spatial-temporal distribution of ACB complex species in a regional watershed and highlights the presence of ACB complex in wastewater effluent that is discharged into a river. These findings deepen our understanding of this group of species in non-nosocomial environments and encourage the development of monitoring programs for these species in regional waters.

              isolates from fresh produce and herbs obtained from retail markets in northern Germany were completely sequenced with MiSeq short-read and MinION long-read sequencing and assembled using a Unicycler hybrid assembly. The data showed that 17 of the strains harbored between one and five plasmids, whereas in five strains, only the circular chromosomal DNA was detected. In total, 38 plasmids were identified. The size of the plasmids detected varied between ca. 2,000 and 326,000 bp, and heavy metal resistance genes were found on seven (18.4%) of the plasmids. Eleven plasmids (28.9%) showed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes. Among large plasmids (&gt;32,000 bp), IncF plasmids (specifically, IncFIB and IncFII) were the most abundant replicon types, while all small plasmids were Col-replicons. Six plasmids harbored unit and composite transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes, with IS26 identified as the primary insertion sequence. Class 1 integrons carrying antibiotic resistance genes were also detected on chromosomes of two
              <jats:italic>Citrobacter</jats:italic>
              isolates and on four plasmids. Mob-suite analysis revealed that 36.8% of plasmids in this study were found to be conjugative, while 28.9% were identified as mobilizable. Overall, our study showed that
              <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic>
              from fresh produce possess antibiotic resistance genes on both chromosome and plasmid, some of which are considered to be transferable. This indicates the potential for

              from raw vegetables carried plasmids ranging in size from 2,715 to 326,286 bp, of which about less than one-third carried antibiotic resistance genes encoding resistance toward antibiotics such as tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, fosfomycins, sulfonamides, quinolones, and β-lactam antibiotics. Some strains encoded multiple resistances, and some encoded extended-spectrum β-lactamases. The study highlights the potential of produce, which may be eaten raw, as a potential vehicle for the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Further, audiences including the general public, stakeholders, agricultural commodity producers, and students to which information is directed often possess various backgrounds and educational training. In response to technological advances, and the benefits of web-based learning tools to deliver complex information, an integrative approach to deliver microbial content information was developed. Through the constructed web-based interface, an interactive format to highlight the microbe of interest consisted of a main image with strategically placed hotspots to illuminate the location/environment/organ where the microbe can be found. As each hotspot is accessed, an additional image and description of the role and function of the microbe at the location is presented. To encourage regular user access with the learning tool, monthly features were created to focus on various concepts in nutritional microbiology. Monthly themes were selected by the educator to cover a specific microbe, environment, and physiological or nutritional function. Facilitation of educator operation of the interface was achieved through development of an easy-to-use dashboard, allowing for uploading of main, monthly, and hotspot images, along with information on the overview of microbe function and with details contained within the hotspot descriptions. Additionally, an archive feature was created to allow access to information that was previously covered within the learning tool. Application of this web-based interface can span across classroom settings, outreach educational events, adult and youth learning within Extension, student recruitment, and many other non-traditional learning settings to impact production agriculture with research-driven microbiological and biological concepts.</jats:p>",en,J Microbiol Biol Educ.,NA,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,online tool,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1128/jmbe.v19i2.1557

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA,2005,NA,NA,NA,NA,phylogeny tool,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1128/aem.71.12.8228-8235.2005

          <jats:p>Human influenza A viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens that cause substantial morbidity and mortality in seasonal epidemics around the globe. To ensure continued protection, the strains used for the production of the seasonal influenza vaccine have to be regularly updated, which involves data collection and analysis by numerous experts worldwide. Computer-guided analysis is becoming increasingly important in this problem due to the vast amounts of generated data. We here describe a computational method for selecting a suitable strain for production of the human influenza A virus vaccine. It interprets available antigenic and genomic sequence data based on measures of antigenic novelty and rate of propagation of the viral strains throughout the population. For viral isolates sampled between 2002 and 2007, we used this method to predict the antigenic evolution of the H3N2 viruses in retrospective testing scenarios. When seasons were scored as true or false predictions, our method returned six true positives, three false negatives, eight true negatives, and one false positive, or 78% accuracy overall. In comparison to the recommendations by the WHO, we identified the correct antigenic variant once at the same time and twice one season ahead. Even though it cannot be ruled out that practical reasons such as lack of a sufficiently well-growing candidate strain may in some cases have prevented recommendation of the best-matching strain by the WHO, our computational decision procedure allows quantitative interpretation of the growing amounts of data and may help to match the vaccine better to predominating strains in seasonal influenza epidemics.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Human influenza A viruses continuously change antigenically to circumvent the immune protection evoked by vaccination or previously circulating viral strains. To maintain vaccine protection and thereby reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by infections, regular updates of the vaccine strains are required. We have developed a data-driven framework for vaccine strain prediction which facilitates the computational analysis of genetic and antigenic data and does not rely on explicit evolutionary models. Our computational decision procedure generated good matches of the vaccine strain to the circulating predominant strain for most seasons and could be used to support the expert-guided prediction made by the WHO; it thus may allow an increase in vaccine efficacy.

            GET_HOMOLOGUES is an open-source software package that builds on popular orthology-calling approaches making highly customizable and detailed pangenome analyses of microorganisms accessible to nonbioinformaticians. It can cluster homologous gene families using the bidirectional best-hit, COGtriangles, or OrthoMCL clustering algorithms. Clustering stringency can be adjusted by scanning the domain composition of proteins using the HMMER3 package, by imposing desired pairwise alignment coverage cutoffs, or by selecting only syntenic genes. The resulting homologous gene families can be made even more robust by computing consensus clusters from those generated by any combination of the clustering algorithms and filtering criteria. Auxiliary scripts make the construction, interrogation, and graphical display of core genome and pangenome sets easy to perform. Exponential and binomial mixture models can be fitted to the data to estimate theoretical core genome and pangenome sizes, and high-quality graphics can be generated. Furthermore, pangenome trees can be easily computed and basic comparative genomics performed to identify lineage-specific genes or gene family expansions. The software is designed to take advantage of modern multiprocessor personal computers as well as computer clusters to parallelize time-consuming tasks. To demonstrate some of these capabilities, we survey a set of 50
