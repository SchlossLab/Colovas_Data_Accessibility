            The effect of optimized maternal therapy by bactericidal agents was evaluated in a reproducible rabbit model of
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            maternofetal infection simulating human pharmacokinetics. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was begun in the pregnant rabbit 12 h after bacterial intrauterine inoculation, using a computer-controlled pump to simulate human pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone (1 g/day) associated or not with gentamicin (3 mg/kg of body weight/day). Data were compared for fetal survival, quantitative blood cultures, fetal histology in treated versus untreated groups, and maternal and fetal antibiotic concentrations in plasma in treated animals. Antibiotic therapy led to dramatic improvement in maternal outcome (100% survival versus 100% death in the untreated group in association with maternal septicemia). Fetal survival also improved, with the two-drug combination providing a more potent effect. After 3 days of treatment, 32% of fetuses survived with one-drug therapy and 62% with two-drug therapy (Yates corrected χ

In untreated animals, bacterial counts in blood cultures increased rapidly during the first 24 h up to 8.1 ± 0.5 log CFU/ml, but remained relatively constant at all times with antibiotic treatment: 4.5 ± 0.7 log CFU/ml at the start of treatment and 6.2 ± 0.4 and 5.2 ± 0.9 log CFU/ml after 72 h for one- and two-drug therapy, respectively (data are means ± standard deviations). The failure of animals to be cured after 3 days of treatment was not due to an inadequate concentration of ceftriaxone, as the residual level in fetal serum at sacrifice was more than 1,000 times the MIC of the microbe. Unexpectedly, inflammation in fetal lung decreased in the treated group after as little as 24 h of antibiotic therapy, despite persistent bacteremia. Although maternal outcome improved and drug concentrations were above the MIC, the treatment did not achieve sterilization of fetuses in utero for this rabbit

In 2002, one isolate resistant to metronidazole (MIC = 64 μg/ml) was noted. These data indicate changes in susceptibility over time; surprisingly, some antimicrobial agents are more active now than they were 5 years ago.

A total of 628 patients were enrolled and assessed by evaluation of their clinical and bacteriological responses 5 to 7 days and 21 to 28 days after administration of the last dose of study medication. Although the trial was designed, on the basis of predefined outcomes, to demonstrate the equivalence of the two regimens, the results showed statistically significant higher clinical success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.4%, and for comparator regimen, 85.4%; difference [Δ], 8.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91 to 13.19%;

This superiority was seen irrespective of the severity of the pneumonia and whether or not the combination therapy included a macrolide. The time to resolution of fever was also statistically significantly faster for patients who received moxifloxacin (median time, 2 versus 3 days), and the duration of hospital admission was approximately 1 day less for patients who received moxifloxacin. The treatment was converted to oral therapy immediately after the initial mandatory 3-day period of i.v. administration for a larger proportion of patients in the moxifloxacin group than patients in the comparator group (151 [50.2%] versus 57 [17.8%] patients). There were fewer deaths (9 [3.0%] versus 17 [5.3%]) and fewer serious adverse events (38 [12.6%] versus 53 [16.5%]) in the moxifloxacin group than in the comparator group. The rates of drug-related adverse events were comparable in both groups (38.9% in each treatment group). The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. Thus, it is concluded that monotherapy with moxifloxacin is superior to that with a standard combination regimen of a β-lactam and a β-lactamase inhibitor, co-amoxiclav, with or without a macrolide, clarithromycin, in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to a hospital.

            E1210 is a first-in-class, broad-spectrum antifungal with a novel mechanism of action—inhibition of fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis. In this study, the efficacies of E1210 and reference antifungals were evaluated in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. Oral E1210 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in infections caused by

          <jats:p>The elimination of viral covalently closed circular DNA (CCC DNA) from the nucleus of infected hepatocytes is an obstacle to achieving sustained viral clearance during antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment with adefovir, a new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, the prodrug of which, adefovir dipivoxil, is in clinical evaluation, is able to suppress viral CCC DNA both in vitro and in vivo using the duck HBV (DHBV) model. First, the effect of adefovir on viral CCC DNA synthesis was examined with primary cultures of DHBV-infected fetal hepatocytes. Adefovir was administered for six consecutive days starting one day before or four days after DHBV inoculation. Dose-dependent inhibition of both virion release in culture supernatants and synthesis of intracellular viral DNA was observed. Although CCC DNA amplification was inhibited by adefovir, CCC DNA was not eliminated by antiviral treatment and the de novo formation of CCC DNA was not prevented by pretreatment of the cells. Next, preventive treatment of experimentally infected ducklings with lamivudine or adefovir revealed that both efficiently suppressed viremia and intrahepatic DNA. However, persistence of viral DNA even when detectable only by PCR was associated with a recurrence of viral replication following drug withdrawal. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adefovir is a potent inhibitor of DHBV replication that inhibits CCC DNA amplification but does not effectively prevent the formation of CCC DNA from incoming viral genomes.</jats:p>",en,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,NA,2002,NA

Fluoroquinolones (FQs), successful as drugs clinically, target the enzyme to trap the gyrase-DNA complex, leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in the genome. Mycobacteria are less susceptible to commonly used FQs. However, an 8-methoxy-substituted FQ, moxifloxacin (MFX), is a potent antimycobacterial, and a higher susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to MFX has been demonstrated. Although several models explain the mechanism of FQ action and gyrase-DNA-FQ interaction, the basis for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to various FQs is not understood. We have addressed the basis of the differential susceptibility of the gyrase and revisited the mode of action of FQs. We demonstrate that FQs bind both

            Broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are used clinically as anticancer agents, and more isoform-selective HDACi have been sought to modulate other conditions, including chronic inflammatory diseases. Mouse studies suggest that HDACi downregulate immune responses and may compromise host defense. However, their effects on human macrophage antimicrobial responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that overnight pretreatment of human macrophages with HDACi prior to challenge with
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">Salmonella enterica</jats:named-content>

            results in significantly reduced intramacrophage bacterial loads, which likely reflect the fact that this treatment regime impairs phagocytosis. In contrast, cotreatment of human macrophages with HDACi at the time of bacterial challenge did not impair phagocytosis; instead, HDACi cotreatment actually promoted clearance of intracellular

            . Mechanistically, treatment of human macrophages with HDACi at the time of bacterial infection enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation by these cells. The capacity of HDACi to promote the clearance of intracellular bacteria from human macrophages was abrogated when cells were pretreated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos, which perturbs mitochondrial function. The HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin A promoted bacterial clearance from human macrophages, whereas the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275, which inhibits HDAC1 to -3, had no effect on intracellular bacterial loads. These data are consistent with HDAC6 and/or related HDACs constraining mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production from human macrophages during bacterial challenge. Our findings suggest that, whereas long-term HDACi treatment regimes may potentially compromise host defense, selective HDAC inhibitors may have applications in treating acute bacterial infections.

            Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 remain major human pathogens despite the development of anti-HSV therapeutics as some of the first antiviral drugs. Current therapies are incompletely effective and frequently drive the evolution of drug-resistant mutants. We recently determined that certain natural troponoid compounds such as β-thujaplicinol readily suppress HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication. Here, we screened 26 synthetic α-hydroxytropolones with the goals of determining a preliminary structure-activity relationship for the α-hydroxytropolone pharmacophore and providing a starting point for future optimization studies. Twenty-five compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at 50 μM, and 10 compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 5 μM, with similar inhibition patterns and potencies against both viruses being observed. The two most powerful inhibitors shared a common biphenyl side chain, were capable of inhibiting HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) of 81 to 210 nM, and also strongly inhibited acyclovir-resistant mutants. Moderate to low cytotoxicity was observed for all compounds (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ] of 50 to &gt;100 μM). Therapeutic indexes ranged from &gt;170 to &gt;1,200. These data indicate that troponoids and specifically α-hydroxytropolones are a promising lead scaffold for development as anti-HSV drugs provided that toxicity can be further minimized. Troponoid drugs are envisioned to be employed alone or in combination with existing nucleos(t)ide analogs to suppress HSV replication far enough to prevent viral shedding and to limit the development of or treat nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant mutants.

After 7 days of administration of a cholesterol-enriched diet (0.50% [wt/vol]) or a regular rabbit diet, each rabbit was administered a single intravenous bolus of Doc-AmB (

Blood samples were obtained daily before and 24 h after the administration of each dose and serially thereafter following the administration of the last dose for the assessment of pharmacokinetics in plasma, kidney toxicity, plasma lipoprotein levels, and drug distribution in tissue. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood following the administration of ABLC were also determined in rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched and regular diets (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 3 each group). Before drug treatment, cholesterol-fed rabbits demonstrated marked increases in total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol levels in plasma compared with the levels in rabbits on a regular diet. No significant differences in total plasma triglyceride levels were observed. Significant increases in plasma creatinine levels were observed in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) and rabbits fed a regular diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) when administered AmB. However, the magnitude of this increase was twofold greater in rabbits fed a regular diet than in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. An increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed only in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered ABLC. The pharmacokinetics of AmB were significantly altered in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered Doc-AmB or ABLC compared to those in rabbits on a regular diet administered each of these compounds. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood were significantly different following ABLC administration but not following Doc-AmB administration in both rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched diets and rabbits fed regular diets compared to their corresponding pharmacokinetics in plasma. An increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the TRL fraction when Doc-AmB was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet than when it was administered to rabbits fed a regular diet. Furthermore, an increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the LDL and TRL fractions when ABLC was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet rabbits fed a regular diet. These findings suggest that an increase in plasma cholesterol levels modifies the pharmacokinetics of AmB and renal toxicity following the administration of multiple intravenous doses of Doc-AmB and ABLC.

            , have a high potential for industrial applications. Recent studies showed that deletion of six AT-rich islands from the
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            genome results in reduced amounts of extracellular LipA. Here we demonstrate that the reduced LipA levels are due to the absence of four genes,

            , located in the prophage 1 region. Intact
            <jats:italic>skfABCD</jats:italic>
            genes are required not only for LipA production at wild-type levels by
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            168 but also under conditions of LipA overproduction. Notably, SkfA has bactericidal activity and, probably, requires the SkfB to SkfD proteins for its production. The present results show that LipA is more prone to proteolytic degradation in the absence of SkfA and that high-level LipA production can be improved significantly by employing multiple protease-deficient
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            strains. In conclusion, our findings imply that SkfA protects LipA, directly or indirectly, against proteolytic degradation. Conceivably, SkfA could act as a modulator in LipA folding or as a protease inhibitor.

Some microorganisms, including species of lactobacilli or lactococci, are known to contribute to the organoleptic quality of cheeses, whereas the presence of other microorganisms may lead to spoilage or constitute a health risk.
            <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
            is recognized worldwide as an important food-borne pathogen, owing to the production of enterotoxins in food matrices. In order to study enterotoxin gene expression during cheese manufacture, we developed an efficient procedure to recover total RNA from cheese and applied a robust strategy to study gene expression by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). This method yielded pure preparations of undegraded RNA suitable for RT-qPCR. To normalize RT-qPCR data, expression of 10 potential reference genes was investigated during
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            growth in milk and in cheese. The three most stably expressed reference genes during cheese manufacture were

            Target site inaccessibility represents a significant problem for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 16S rRNA with oligonucleotide probes. Here, unlabeled oligonucleotides (helpers) that bind adjacent to the probe target site were evaluated for their potential to increase weak probe hybridization signals in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            DSM 30083
            <jats:sup>T</jats:sup>
            . The use of helpers enhanced the fluorescence signal of all six probes examined at least fourfold. In one case, the signal of probe Eco474 was increased 25-fold with the use of a single helper probe, H440-2. In another case, four unlabeled helpers raised the FISH signal of a formerly weak probe, Eco585, to the level of the brightest monolabeled oligonucleotide probes available for
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            . The temperature of dissociation and the mismatch discrimination of probes were not significantly influenced by the addition of helpers. Therefore, using helpers should not cause labeling of additional nontarget organisms at a defined stringency of hybridization. However, the helper action is based on sequence-specific binding, and there is thus a potential for narrowing the target group which must be considered when designing helpers. We conclude that helpers can open inaccessible rRNA regions for FISH with oligonucleotide probes and will thereby further improve the applicability of this technique for in situ identification of microorganisms.

At the highest ionic strength, we did not observe a significant difference in the attachment rate of wild-type and paralyzed cells at either fluid velocity. However, when the ionic strength was reduced, paralyzed bacteria attached at rates 4 and 10 times lower than that of the wild type under fluid velocities of 0.0044 and 0.044 cms

We then compared the attachment rates of smooth-swimming (counterclockwise rotation only) and tumbly (clockwise rotation only) cells to the wild type to determine whether the direction of rotation was important to cell attachment. At 0.0044 cms

            , the smooth-swimming cells attached at rates similar to that of the wild type in both buffer solutions but significantly less at the higher fluid velocity. Tumbly cells attached at much lower rates under all conditions. Thus, the combination of clockwise and counterclockwise flagellar rotation and their coupling appeared to be important in cell attachment. We considered a number of hypotheses to interpret these observations, including a residence time analysis and a comparison of traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to soft-particle theory.

The cell-associated concentration of iron was 500 μg per gram (dry cell weight) of the recombinant yeast but was 210 μg per gram (dry cell weight) in the wild type. These findings indicate that the iron-carrying capacity of yeast is improved by heterologous expression of tadpole ferritin and suggests that this approach may help relieve dietary iron deficiencies in domesticated animals by the use of the engineered yeast as a feed and food supplement.

Growth on maltose, a product of starch hydrolysis, was associated with the production of a prominent membrane-associated protein that had an apparent molecular weight of 43,800 and was not detected in cells grown on xylose or glucose. Filter-binding assays revealed that cell membranes bound maltose with high affinity. Metabolic labeling of

A maltose-binding protein was purified by using an amylose resin affinity column, and the binding constant was 270 nM. Since maltase activity was found only in the cytosol of fractionated cells and unlabeled glucose did not compete with radiolabeled maltose for uptake in whole cells, it appeared that maltose was transported intact. In whole-cell transport assays, the affinity for maltose was approximately 40 nM. Maltotriose and α-trehalose competitively inhibited maltose uptake in transport assays, whereas glucose, cellobiose, and a range of disaccharides had little effect.

The structure of the formate and lactate biofilms increased in roughness, and the substratum coverage decreased, to alleviate the metabolic constraints derived from the assimilation of carbon from the substrates. Low levels of acetate promoted formate carbon assimilation and biofilm growth and increased the system's performance to levels comparable to those with acetate only. Lactate carbon assimilation also limited biofilm growth and led to the partial oxidization of lactate to acetate. However, lactate was fully oxidized in the presence of fumarate, which redirected carbon fluxes into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and by acetate-grown biofilms.

Enterocoliticin addition to logarithmic-phase cultures of susceptible bacterial strains led to a rapid dose-dependent reduction in CFU. Calorimetric measurements of the heat output of cultures of sensitive bacteria showed a complete loss of cellular metabolic activity immediately upon addition of enterocoliticin.

          <jats:p>Bacterial communities reside in basal ice, sediment, and meltwater in the supra-, sub-, and proglacial environments of John Evans Glacier, Nunavut, Canada. We examined whether the subglacial bacterial community shares common members with the pro- and supraglacial communities, and by inference, whether it could be derived from communities in either of these environments (e.g., by ice overriding proglacial sediments or by in-wash of surface meltwaters). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes amplified from these environments revealed that the subglacial water, basal ice, and sediment communities were distinct from those detected in supraglacial meltwater and proglacial sediments, with 60 of 142 unique terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) detected exclusively in subglacial samples and only 8 T-RFs detected in all three environments. Supraglacial waters shared some T-RFs with subglacial water and ice, likely reflecting the seasonal flow of surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system, whereas supraglacial and proglacial communities shared the fewest T-RFs. Thus, the subglacial community at John Evans Glacier appears to be predominantly autochthonous rather than allochthonous, and it may be adapted to subglacial conditions. Chemical analysis of water and melted ice also revealed differences between the supraglacial and proglacial environments, particularly regarding electrical conductivity and nitrate, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Whereas the potential exists for common bacterial types to be broadly distributed throughout the glacial system, we have observed distinct bacterial communities in physically and chemically different glacial environments.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA,2006,NA

            The current study was designed to investigate the impact of genetic heterogeneity on host immune responses to pulmonary intracellular infection by using two mouse strains of distinct genetic background, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and a model intracellular pathogen,
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            BCG. Upon infection, compared to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice developed an earlier response of interleukin 12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage chemoattractive protein 1, and greater neutrophilic influx to the lung by days 7 and 14. However, the level of these cytokines at days 27, 43, and 71 was much lower in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. The magnitude of cellular responses was also much lower in the lung of BALB/c mice around day 27. Histologically, while C57BL/6 mice developed lymphocytic granulomas, BALB/c mice displayed atypical granulomas in the lung. Of importance, the level of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 remained low and similar in the lung of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice throughout. Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from systemic and local lymphoid tissues of infected BALB/c mice demonstrated a markedly lower antigen-specific IFN-γ recall response. While the number of mycobacterial bacilli recovered from both the lung and spleen of BALB/c mice was similar to that in C57BL/6 mice at day 14, it was higher than that in C57BL/6 mice at day 43. However, it was eventually leveled off to that in C57BL/6 counterparts later. These results suggest the following: (i) genetic heterogeneity can lead to differential innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses to primary pulmonary mycobacterial infection; (ii) it is the level of adaptive, but not innate, immune response that is critical to host resistance; and (iii) a lower type 1 immune response in BALB/c mice is not accompanied by a heightened type 2 response during pulmonary mycobacterial infection.

Immunization of mice with folded, full-length, purified SadA elicited an IgG response which provided limited protection against bacterial challenge. When anti-SadA IgG titers were enhanced by administering alum-precipitated protein, a modest additional protection was afforded. Therefore, despite SadA having pleiotropic functions, it is not a dominant, protective antigen for antibody-mediated protection against

Although both toxins have similar biological activities, Stx2a is more frequently produced by STEC strains that cause HUS than is Stx1a.

We also compared several biochemical and histological parameters in mice intoxicated orally versus intraperitoneally with Stx2a. We discovered that both intoxication routes caused similar increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, indicative of kidney damage, as well as electrolyte imbalances and weight loss in the animals. Furthermore, kidney sections from Stx2a-intoxicated mice revealed multifocal, acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Of particular note, we detected Stx2a in kidney sections from orally intoxicated mice in the same region as the epithelial cell type in which ATN was detected. Lastly, we showed reduced renal damage, as determined by renal biomarkers and histopathology, and full protection of orally intoxicated mice with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 11E10 directed against the toxin A subunit; conversely, an irrelevant MAb had no therapeutic effect. Orally intoxicated mice could be rescued by MAb 11E10 6 h but not 24 h after Stx2a delivery.

We studied the availability of amino acids by the generation of auxotrophic strains for alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, and proline in a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) and an epithelial cell line (HeLa) and examined access to extracellular nutrients for nutrition. Auxotrophies for alanine, asparagine, or proline attenuated intracellular replication in HeLa cells, while aspartate, asparagine, or proline auxotrophies attenuated intracellular replication in RAW264.7 macrophages. The different patterns of intracellular attenuation of alanine- or aspartate-auxotrophic strains support distinct nutritional conditions in HeLa cells and RAW264.7 macrophages. Supplementation of medium with individual amino acids restored the intracellular replication of mutant strains auxotrophic for asparagine, proline, or glutamine.

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Plasmodium falciparum</jats:named-content>
            infection. The most severe outcomes for patients include coma, permanent neurological deficits, and death. Recently, a large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in humans identified brain swelling as the most prominent predictor of fatal HCM. Therefore, in this study, we sought to define the mechanism controlling brain edema through the use of the murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model. Specifically, we investigated the ability of CD8 T cells to initiate brain edema during ECM. We determined that areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability colocalized with a reduction of the cerebral endothelial cell tight-junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. Furthermore, through small-animal MRI, we analyzed edema and vascular leakage. Using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, we determined that vascular permeability is not homogeneous but rather confined to specific regions of the brain. Our findings show that BBB permeability was localized within the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and lateral ventricle. Concurrently with the initiation of vascular permeability, T2-weighted MRI revealed edema and brain swelling. Importantly, ablation of the cytolytic effector molecule perforin fully protected against vascular permeability and edema. Furthermore, perforin production specifically by CD8 T cells was required to cause fatal edema during ECM. We propose that CD8 T cells initiate BBB breakdown through perforin-mediated disruption of tight junctions. In turn, leakage from the vasculature into the parenchyma causes brain swelling and edema. This results in a breakdown of homeostatic maintenance that likely contributes to ECM pathology.

The Bcc is a complex of 20 species and is rarely eradicated once a patient is colonized; therefore, vaccination may represent a better therapeutic option. We developed a new proteomics approach to identify bacterial proteins that are involved in the attachment of Bcc bacteria to lung epithelial cells. Fourteen proteins were reproducibly identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from four Bcc strains representative of two Bcc species:

In this study the involvement of IL-4 in murine Lyme disease was examined in C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice with targeted disruptions in the IL-4 gene, the IL-4Rα chain gene, or both. A spectrum of arthritis severity was seen in BALB/cJ mice, and ablation of IL-4, IL-4Rα, or both had no effect on the overall severity of arthritis as determined by joint swelling and histopathology. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice exhibited mild to moderate arthritis, and ablation of IL-4 again had no effect on arthritis severity. IL-4- and IL-4Rα-deficient mice produced extremely low levels of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and showed increased production of IgG2b. This shift in immunoglobulin isotype had no effect on the host's ability to control spirochete growth in either strain of mouse, as determined by PCR detection of
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            DNA from heart and ankle tissues. In summary, the IL-4-IL-4Rα pathway, including IL-13 signaling, neither limits arthritis severity nor is required for control of spirochete growth during
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            infection of mice. Furthermore, the IgG1 isotype is not required to control
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            cell numbers in tissues. These findings suggest the host defense against

          <jats:p>In renal bacterial infections granulocytes are of major importance in the primary immune defense against invading pathogens. However, the mechanisms of granulocytic activation in renal interstitial invasion have not been clarified. Renal tubular epithelial cell mechanisms inducing granulocytic activation and bacterial killing may include tubular cell expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), a urinary protein that is known to enhance cytokine expression in monocytes. We studied the role of THP in granulocytic activation. A strong binding of THP to human granulocytes was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Urinary THP and supernatants of THP-expressing cultured tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) enhanced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression by human granulocytes. Renal tubular cells growing polarized on polycarbonate membranes were used to study apical versus basal THP expression. By electron microscopy THP immunoreactivity was exclusively found on the apical surfaces of tubular cells and was absent on the basolateral cell membrane. In the apical cell culture compartment we found significantly more stimulatory activity for granulocytic IL-8 expression. CD62L, a selectin less expressed in activated granulocytes, was decreased in granulocytes incubated with urinary THP and in supernatants of THP-producing renal tubular cells but not in supernatants from THP-negative cells. Again, the effect on CD62L expression was found only in apical culture media and was absent in the basal compartment. In summary our data give evidence that renal tubular cell THP expression may be relevant in kidney diseases since THP is a potent activator of human granulocytes. The regulation of apical versus basal THP expression and release in vivo may be crucial in the induction of the inflammatory response, e.g., in bacterial renal diseases.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA,2002,NA

The only combinations of toxin proteins causing cell cycle arrest were the presence of all three Cdt proteins and the combination of CdtB and CdtC. A similar experimental protocol was used to determine if recombinant Cdt proteins were able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce cytokines. The individual Cdt proteins were able to induce the synthesis by PBMCs of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 but not of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-12, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, with CdtC being the most potent and CdtB being the least potent cytokine inducer. There was evidence of synergism between these Cdt proteins in the stimulation of cytokine production, most markedly with gamma interferon, which required the minimum interaction of CdtB and -C to stimulate production.

            Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) and membrane CD14 function to enhance the responses of monocytes to low concentrations of endotoxin. Surprisingly, recent reports have suggested that LBP or CD14 may be dispensable for macrophage responses to low concentrations of LPS or may even exert an inhibitory effect in the case of LBP. We therefore investigated whether LBP and CD14 participated in the response of mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) to LPS stimulation. In the presence of a low amount of plasma (&lt;1%) or of recombinant mouse or human LBP, PEM were found to respond to low concentrations of LPS (&lt;5 to 10 ng/ml) in an LBP- and CD14-dependent manner. However, tumor necrosis factor production (not interleukin-6 production) by LPS-stimulated PEM was reduced when cells were stimulated in the presence of higher concentrations of plasma or serum (5 or 10%). Yet, the inhibitory effect of plasma or serum was not mediated by LBP. Taken together with previous results obtained with
            <jats:italic>LBP</jats:italic>

            , the protective antigen (PA), the lethal factor (LF), and the edema factor (EF), combine in pairs to produce the lethal (PA+LF) and edema (PA+EF) toxins. A genetic strategy was developed to introduce by allelic exchange specific point mutations or in-frame deletions into
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            toxin genes, thereby impairing either LF metalloprotease or EF adenylate cyclase activity or PA functional domains. In vivo effects of toxin mutations were analyzed in an experimental infection of mice. A tight correlation was observed between the properties of anthrax toxins delivered in vivo and their in vitro activities. The synergic effects of the lethal and edema toxins resulted purely from their enzymatic activities, suggesting that in vivo these toxins may act together. The PA-dependent antibody response to LF induced by immunization with live
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            was used to follow the in vivo interaction of LF and PA. We found that the binding of LF to PA in vivo was necessary and sufficient for a strong antibody response against LF, whereas neither LF activity nor binding of lethal toxin complex to the cell surface was required. Mutant PA proteins were cleaved in mice sera. Thus, our data provide evidence that, during anthrax infection, PA may interact with LF before binding to the cell receptor. Immunoprotection studies indicated that the strain producing detoxified LF and EF, isogenic to the current live vaccine Sterne strain, is a safe candidate for use as a vaccine against anthrax.

            O139 emerged in 1992 as a major cause of epidemic cholera. However, the incidence of disease due to this new serogroup subsequently decreased for almost a decade. In April 2002, there was a dramatic resurgence of
            <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic>
            O139 in Bangladesh. We compared the phenotypic properties of the bacterial isolates and the immunological responses in patients with disease due to

            O139 during the 2002 epidemic with those dating to the emergence of this disease in 1993 to 1995. Strains isolated from patients in the two time periods were compared with respect to capsular polysaccharide, their resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum, and their capacity to be used as target strains in complement-mediated vibriocidal assays. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that strains isolated in 2002 had less capsular material than those isolated from 1993 to 1995 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = &lt;0.001), a finding confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Strains isolated in 2002 were more susceptible to the bactericidal activity of serum compared to strains from 1993 to 1995 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.013). Compared to results using a standard O139 strain, a modified vibriocidal assay utilizing a 2002 strain, CIRS 134, as the target organism detected higher vibriocidal responses in both O139-infected cholera patients as well as O139 vaccine recipients. The vibriocidal assay utilizing the less encapsulated 2002 strain, CIRS 134, is a more sensitive indicator of adaptive immune responses to recent infection with
            <jats:italic>V. cholerae</jats:italic>

            operon promoter can be fully activated by binding of the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) to a site centered at position −41.5 upstream of the transcript start, and this activation is modulated by upstream binding of the integration host factor (IHF) and Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) proteins. Thus, transcription initiation is repressed by the binding of IHF and Fis to sites centered at position −88 (IHF I) and position −142 (Fis I) and activated by IHF binding to a site at position −115 (IHF II). Here, we have exploited mutational analysis and biochemistry to investigate the actions of IHF and Fis at these sites. We show that the effects of IHF and Fis are position dependent and that IHF II functions independently of IHF I and Fis I. Using in vitro assays, we report that IHF and Fis repress transcription initiation by interfering with RNA polymerase binding. Differences in the upstream IHF and Fis binding sites at the

symbiosis within legume nodules, where the bacteria differentiate into
nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Expression of genes involved in nitrogen
fixation and associated respiration is governed by two intermediate
regulators, NifA and FixK, respectively, which are controlled by a
two-component regulatory system FixLJ in response to low-oxygen
conditions. In order to identify the FixLJ regulon, gene expression
profiles were determined in microaerobic free-living cells as well as
during the symbiotic life of the bacterium for the wild type and a
            <jats:italic>fixJ</jats:italic>
            null-mutant strain. We identified 122 genes activated by
FixJ in either state, including 87 novel targets. FixJ controls 74% of
the genes induced in microaerobiosis (2% oxygen) and the majority of
genes expressed in mature bacteroids. Ninety-seven percent of
FixJ-activated genes are located on the symbiotic plasmid pSymA.

            and a
            <jats:italic>fixK</jats:italic>
            mutant
showed that NifA activates a limited number of genes, all specific to
the symbiotic state, whereas FixK controls more than 90 genes, involved
in free-living and/or symbiotic life. This study also revealed that
FixJ has no other direct targets besides those already known. FixJ is
involved in the regulation of functions such as denitrification or
amino acid/polyamine metabolism and transport. Mutations in selected
novel FixJ targets did not affect the ability of the bacteria to form
nitrogen-fixing nodules on
            <jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic>
            roots. From these
results, we propose an updated model of the FixJ
regulon.

            continues to pose a health threat in many developing nations and regions of the world struck by natural disasters. It is a pathogen that rapidly adapts to aquatic environments and the human small intestine. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) may contribute to this adaptability. Specifically, the mannitol operon sRNA (MtlS sRNA; previously designated the IGR7 sRNA) is transcribed antisense to the 5′ untranslated region of the
            <jats:italic>mtl</jats:italic>

            expression in the presence of various carbon sources and the role of the MtlS sRNA. We observed that MtlA protein is present only in cells grown on mannitol sugar, whereas MtlS sRNA is expressed during growth on all sugars other than mannitol. In contrast,
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>
            mRNA is expressed in similar amounts regardless of the carbon source used for bacterial growth. These observations suggest that the regulation of MtlA protein expression is a posttranscriptional event. We further demonstrate that MtlS sRNA overexpression repressed MtlA synthesis without affecting the stability of the messenger and that this process is largely independent of Hfq. We propose a model in which, when carbon sources other than mannitol are present, MtlS sRNA is transcribed, base pairs with the 5′ untranslated region of the
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>

            bacteria, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been recognized as important resistance determinants against antimicrobial peptides. Together with neighboring two-component systems (TCSs), which regulate their expression, they form specific detoxification modules. Both the transport permease and sensor kinase components show unusual domain architecture: the permeases contain a large extracellular domain, while the sensor kinases lack an obvious input domain. One of the best-characterized examples is the bacitracin resistance module BceRS-BceAB of
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            . Strikingly, in this system, the ABC transporter and TCS have an absolute mutual requirement for each other in both sensing of and resistance to bacitracin, suggesting a novel mode of signal transduction in which the transporter constitutes the actual sensor. We identified over 250 such BceAB-like ABC transporters in the current databases. They occurred almost exclusively in
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">Firmicutes</jats:named-content>
            bacteria, and 80% of the transporters were associated with a BceRS-like TCS. Phylogenetic analyses of the permease and sensor kinase components revealed a tight evolutionary correlation. Our findings suggest a direct regulatory interaction between the ABC transporters and TCSs, mediating communication between both components. Based on their observed coclustering and conservation of response regulator binding sites, we could identify putative corresponding two-component systems for transporters lacking a regulatory system in their immediate neighborhood. Taken together, our results show that these types of ABC transporters and TCSs have coevolved to form self-sufficient detoxification modules against antimicrobial peptides, widely distributed among

Dehydration of an 88-h FRD1 biofilm revealed other IR bands that were also found in the spectrum of purified FRD1 alginate. These results provide evidence that alginate was present within the FRD1 biofilms and at greater relative concentrations at depths exceeding 1 μm, the analysis range for the ATR/FT-IR technique. After 88 h, biofilms of the nonmucoid strains produced amide II absorbances that were six to eight times as intense as those of the mucoid FRD1 parent strain. However, the cell densities in biofilms were similar, suggesting that FRD1 formed biofilms with most cells at depths that exceeded the analysis range of the ATR/FT-IR technique. SCLM analysis confirmed this result, demonstrating that nonmucoid strains formed densely packed biofilms that were generally less than 6 μm in depth. In contrast, FRD1 produced microcolonies that were approximately 40 μm in depth. An
            <jats:italic>algJ</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>
            -acetyl groups gave an amide II signal approximately fivefold weaker than that of FRD1 and produced small microcolonies. After 44 h, the

            mutant switched to the nonmucoid phenotype and formed uniform biofilms, similar to biofilms produced by the nonmucoid strains. These results demonstrate that alginate, although not required for

            biofilm development, plays a role in the biofilm structure and may act as intercellular material, required for formation of thicker three-dimensional biofilms. The results also demonstrate the importance of alginate O acetylation in

By substituting amino acids in the enzymatic A subunit that are highly conserved in all members of this family, we constructed 23 variants of CT that exhibited decreased or undetectable toxicity and we characterized their biological and biochemical properties. Many variants exhibited previously undescribed temperature-sensitive assembly of holotoxin and/or increased sensitivity to proteolysis, which in all cases correlated with exposure of epitopes of CT-A that are normally hidden in native CT holotoxin. Substitutions within and deletion of the entire active-site-occluding loop demonstrated a prominent role for His-44 and this loop in the structure and activity of CT. Several novel variants with wild-type assembly and stability showed significantly decreased toxicity and enzymatic activity (e.g., variants at positions R11, I16, R25, E29, and S68+V72). In most variants the reduction in toxicity was proportional to the decrease in enzymatic activity. For substitutions or insertions at E29 and Y30 the decrease in toxicity was 10- and 5-fold more than the reduction in enzymatic activity, but for variants with R25G, E110D, or E112D substitutions the decrease in enzymatic activity was 12- to 50-fold more than the reduction in toxicity.

The activity of these phosphatases was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, but not by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases. Mutations at the catalytic site motif, cysteine 11 of MPtpA and cysteine 160 of MPtpB, abolished enzyme activity. Southern blot analysis revealed that, while

            The unusual and complex cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria plays a major role in pathogenesis, with specific complex lipids acting as defensive, offensive, or adaptive effectors of virulence. The phthiocerol and phthiodiolone dimycocerosate esters (PDIMs) comprise one such category of virulence-enhancing lipids. Recent work in several laboratories has established that the
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis fadD26-mmpL7</jats:italic>
            (Rv2930-Rv2942) locus plays a major role in PDIM biosynthesis and secretion and that PDIM is required for virulence. Here we describe two independent transposon mutants (WAg533 and WAg537) of
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            , both of which carry an insertion in Mb0100 (=

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis shows elevated transcription of genes in the operon upstream from the transposon insertion sites in both mutants. Both mutants have altered colony morphology and do not synthesize PDIMs or glycosylphenol-PDIM.

This sensitivity is corrected by methionine and seems to result from destabilization of MetA (homoserine transsuccinylase), the first enzyme in methionine biosynthesis. The MetA protein is known to be sensitive to thermal inactivation, and
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants are more sensitive to heat-induced methionine auxotrophy. Peroxide increases the sensitivity of

            mutants to both heat and acid and may oxidatively damage (carbonylate) destabilized MetA. While acid appears to impair methionine biosynthesis, it leads to derepression of MetA and may inhibit growth by causing toxic accumulation of denatured protein. This is supported by the observation that the overexpression of MetA in
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants causes acid sensitivity that is not corrected by methionine. We propose that polyphosphate acts as a chemical chaperone that helps refold MetA and/or may stimulate proteolysis of toxic denatured protein. The instability of MetA protein may provide a metabolic fuse that blocks growth under conditions that denature proteins; the sensitivity of this fuse is modulated by polyphosphate.

            . Here we explored the base excision repair pathway for the highly mutagenic 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a ubiquitous form of oxidized guanine. In most organisms, 8-oxoG is removed by a specific DNA glycosylase (Fpg in bacteria or OGG1 in eukaryotes). In the case where replication of the lesion yields an A/8-oxoG base pair, a second DNA glycosylase (MutY) can excise the adenine and thus avoid the fixation of the mutation in the next round of replication.

            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            in cat populations was evaluated by serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18%) resulted in detection of bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serology; 207 (38%) were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results for 65 (12.2%) showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The molecular typing of the isolates showed that 20.6% of bacteremic cats were infected with
            <jats:italic>B. henselae</jats:italic>
            type I strain, 61.1% were infected with

            type II, and 18.3% were coinfected with both. A statistically significant difference in antibody and bacteremia prevalences among geographical areas was detected. Statistical analysis showed no association between characteristics such as seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological test was 84.7%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8%. Receiving operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of

          <jats:p>Supplemental assays, such as recombinant immunoblot assays (RIBA), are used to confirm detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, due to their expense, they are not widely used in developing countries. The purpose of our study was to compare the results of second- and third-generation (G2 and G3, respectively) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and to resolve discordant results by using a supplemental assay to assess the reliability of G2 and G3 EIAs to confirm anti-HCV antibody-positive results. We performed both G2 and G3 EIAs for anti-HCV antibodies on 1,134 serum samples collected during the 2nd year of a longitudinal community-based study in Egypt; 35 samples with discordant results were tested by Abbott Laboratories Micro-Particle Immunoassay (M-EIA) and RIBA. Viremia was determined with an in-house nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect HCV RNA. Concordance between the two assays (G2/G3) was 96.9%; 87 (7.7%) samples were positive and 1,012 (89.2%) were negative by both assays. For 17 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay negative and G3 assay positive, and for 18 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay positive and G3 assay negative. Among the 17 G2 assay-negative and G3 assay-positive samples, 15 were M-EIA positive and 7 were PCR positive. Among the 18 G2 assay-positive and G3 assay-negative samples, 2 were M-EIA positive and none were PCR positive. RIBA results from 24 discordant samples showed 87.5% agreement with the G3 EIA, 12.5% agreement with the G2 EIA, and 95.8% agreement with M-EIA. Eleven samples were indeterminate by RIBA and excluded from this analysis. Based on RIBA results, the sensitivity of the G3 EIA was 99%, compared to 89.8% for the G2 EIA, while the specificity of the G3 EIA was 99.8%, compared to 98.9% for the G2 EIA. These results show that the reliability of the G3 EIA in screening these sera is excellent, and the G3 assay can be used in the absence of supplemental tests where resources are limited. RIBA appears not to have advantages over the less expensive M-EIA screening assay. The main disadvantage of RIBA is the occurrence of indeterminate results, especially among problematic samples. Samples giving discordant results in multiple assays are often indeterminate with the RIBA.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA,2002,NA

There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three different primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method. Similar differences between SCGE and QCGE were found on testing of 14 isolates of four other

          <jats:p>Gastrointestinal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among young children and immunocompromised patients. Diarrhea may result from infection with a variety of microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Historically, the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea has been made using microscopy, antigen tests, culture, and real-time PCR. A combination of these traditional tests is often required due to the inability to distinguish between infectious etiologies based on the clinical presentation alone. Recently, several multiplex molecular assays have been developed for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens directly from clinical stool samples. These panels allow for the detection and identification of up to 20 pathogens in as little as 1 h. This review will focus on the multiplex molecular panels that have received clearance from the FDA for the diagnosis of diarrheal disease and will highlight issues related to test performance, result interpretation, and cost-effectiveness of these new molecular diagnostic tools.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA,2015,NA

            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            was evaluated with 600 consecutive clinical samples. These samples, including 552 respiratory specimens and 48 nonrespiratory specimens, were collected from 333 patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from September to October 2003. The results of both assays were compared to the gold standard of combined culture results and clinical diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAPID BAP-MTB assay for respiratory specimens were 66.7% and 97.2%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 56.7% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the RAPID BAP-MTB were 74.1% and 96.0%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 59.6% and 94.7%, respectively. For smear-negative samples, the sensitivity of the RAPID BAP-MTB and DTB assays was 57.1% and 40.5%, respectively. The RAPID BAP-MTB assay produced 14 false-positive results in 14 samples, including one of the six samples yielding
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</jats:italic>
            , one of the six samples yielding
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium avium intracellulare</jats:italic>
            , one sample from a patient with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis with complete treatment, and three samples from three patients with a previous diagnosis of tuberculosis who were under treatment at the time of specimen collection. Among the 48 nonrespiratory specimens, the RAPID BAP-MTB assay was positive in one biopsy sample from a patient with lumbar tuberculous spondylitis and one pus sample from a patient with tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy. Our results showed that the RAPID BAP-MTB assay is better than the DTB assay for both respiratory specimens and nonrespiratory specimens. The overall time for processing this assay is only 5 h. In addition, its diagnostic accuracy in smear-negative samples is as high as in smear-positive samples.

            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            associated with the botulism case. This was performed using a variety of techniques, including

            culture phenotypic properties, neurotoxin characterization, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) banding patterns. Cultures associated with this case as well as isolates from stored and historical samples were analyzed and compared.
            <jats:italic>C. botulinum</jats:italic>
            type B PFGE patterns from the infant and from an opened container of infant formula were indistinguishable, while the PFGE profile of a strain presumably isolated from an unopened archival container was unique. The results suggest that the unopened brand of formula was not the source for transmission of spores to the infant and that the strain was distinct from previous botulism cases in the United Kingdom. Since environmental testing was not performed, it is not possible to deduce other sources of transmission.

There is, however, a lack of exercises examining the effects of desiccation on bacterial growth and survival. This particular form of antimicrobial control is especially relevant today with an increased emphasis on coughing and sneezing into one’s sleeve or a tissue, where microbes will not contaminate hands and will eventually desiccate and die (2). Desiccation can have bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects depending on the species, the material on which the organism has desiccated, and the length of time. The absence of water can damage many cellular components, including enzymes, nucleic acids, and cell membranes (1). However, many prokaryotes have some degree of resistance to desiccation, with Escherichia coli surviving around 24 hours and Bacillus species surviving upwards of 300 years, though these numbers can vary due to a number of confounding factors (5). Some of these factors include the method by which desiccation occurred, whether desiccation occurred in a natural or laboratory situation, and the species itself (5). To address the effects of desiccation on bacterial growth and survival, a short, simple exercise was developed. By inoculating various materials with bacterial cultures and allowing them to air-dry for 24 hours, students can visualize the effects of desiccation by analyzing the growth, or lack thereof, when organisms are transferred to nutrient agar plates. This exercise has been used in a health professions microbiology course as well as a microbiology course for biology and biochemistry majors.

            With the recent rise of alternative instructional methodologies such as flipped classrooms and active learning, many core concepts are being introduced outside of the classroom prior to scheduled class meeting times. One popular means for external concept introduction in many undergraduate biology courses is the use of stand-alone online learning modules. Using a group of four large introductory biology course sections, we investigate the use of a stand-alone online learning module developed using animations from Virtual Cell Animation Collection as a resource for the introduction of cellular respiration concepts outside of the classroom. Results from four sections of introductory biology (

          <jats:p>Rhinoviral infection is an important trigger of acute inflammatory exacerbations in patients with underlying airway disease. We have previously established that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is central in the communication between epithelial cells and monocytes during the initiation of inflammation. In this study we explored the roles of IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the responses of airway cells to rhinovirus-1B (RV-1B) and further determined how responses to RV-1B were modified in a model of bacterial coinfection. Our results revealed that IL-1β dramatically potentiated RV-1B-induced proinflammatory responses, and while monocytes did not directly amplify responses to RV-1B alone, they played an important role in the responses observed with our coinfection model. MyD88 is the essential signaling adapter for IL-1β and most Toll-like receptors. To examine the role of MyD88 in more detail, we created stable MyD88 knockdown epithelial cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to MyD88. We determined that IL-1β/MyD88 plays a role in regulating RV-1B replication and the inflammatory response to viral infection of airway cells. These results identify central roles for IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the production of CXCL8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, in viral infection. Thus, IL-1β is a viable target for controlling the neutrophilia that is often found in inflammatory airway disease and is exacerbated by viral infection of the airways.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2011,NA

            TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 × 10
            <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>

To determine whether the B-lymphocyte expansions characteristic of this syndrome represent polyclonal and virus-specific processes, the antigen specificity of B cells in lymphoid tissues of monkeys infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimeras was assessed using an inverse immunohistochemical assay with biotinylated HIV-1 envelope gp120 (Env) as an antigen probe. Env-binding B cells were found aggregated in lymph node and splenic germinal centers (GCs). Most Env-binding GCs also contained an unstained population of B cells, suggesting the GCs were formed by a polyclonal (oligoclonal) process. By day 42 following infection, Env-binding B cells were present in 19% of all lymph node GCs. Env-binding cells were present in 25% of GCs even during chronic infection. This extraordinarily high frequency of Env-specific B lymphocytes suggests that the expansion of virus-specific B cells may largely account for the follicular hyperplasia in AIDS virus-infected individuals.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2002,NA

          <jats:p>Previously, we characterized two host protein binding elements located within the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome and assessed their functions in defective-interfering (DI) RNA replication. To determine the role of RNA secondary structures within these two host protein binding elements in viral replication, we explored the secondary structure of the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the MHV strain JHM genome using limited RNase digestion assays. Our data indicate that multiple stem-loop and hairpin-loop structures exist within this region. Mutant and wild-type DIssEs were employed to test the function of secondary structure elements in DI RNA replication. Three stem structures were chosen as targets for the introduction of transversion mutations designed to destroy base pairing structures. Mutations predicted to destroy the base pairing of nucleotides 142 to 136 with nucleotides 68 to 74 exhibited a deleterious effect on DIssE replication. Destruction of base pairing between positions 96 to 99 and 116 to 113 also decreased DI RNA replication. Mutations interfering with the pairing of nucleotides 67 to 63 with nucleotides 52 to 56 had only minor effects on DIssE replication. The introduction of second complementary mutations which restored the predicted base pairing of positions 142 to 136 with 68 to 74 and nucleotides 96 to 99 with 116 to 113 largely ameliorated defects in replication ability, restoring DI RNA replication to levels comparable to that of wild-type DIssE RNA, suggesting that these secondary structures are important for efficient MHV replication. We also identified a conserved 23-nucleotide stem-loop structure involving nucleotides 142 to 132 and nucleotides 68 to 79. The upstream side of this conserved stem-loop is contained within a host protein binding element (nucleotides 166 to 129).</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2001,NA

            Betanodavirus B2 belongs to a group of functionally related proteins from the sense-strand RNA virus family
            <jats:italic>Nodaviridae</jats:italic>
            that suppress cellular RNA interference. The B2 proteins of insect alphanodaviruses block RNA interference by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thus preventing Dicer-mediated cleavage and the subsequent generation of short interfering RNAs. We show here that the fish betanodavirus B2 protein also binds dsRNA. Binding is sequence independent, and maximal binding occurs with dsRNA substrates greater than 20 bp in length. The binding of B2 to long dsRNA is sufficient to completely block Dicer cleavage of dsRNA in vitro. Protein-protein interaction studies indicated that B2 interacts with itself and with other dsRNA binding proteins, the interaction occurring through binding to shared dsRNA substrates. Induction of the dsRNA-dependent interferon response was not antagonized by B2, as the interferon-responsive

            <jats:italic>Mx</jats:italic>
            instead relied solely on viral RNA1 accumulation, which is impaired in the B2 mutant. Hyperediting of virus dsRNA and site-specific editing of 5-HT2C mRNA were both antagonized by B2. RNA editing was not, however, observed in transfected wild-type or B2 mutant RNA1, suggesting that this pathway does not contribute to the RNA1 accumulation defect of the B2 mutant. We thus conclude that betanodavirus B2 is a dsRNA binding protein that sequesters and protects both long and short dsRNAs to protect betanodavirus from cellular RNA interference.

          <jats:p>Localization of VP40 in Marburg virus (MBGV)-infected cells was studied by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analysis. VP40 was detected in association with nucleocapsid structures, present in viral inclusions and at sites of virus budding. Additionally, VP40 was identified in the foci of virus-induced membrane proliferation and in intracellular membrane clusters which had the appearance of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). VP40-containing MVBs were free of nucleocapsids. When analyzed by immunogold labeling, the concentration of VP40 in MVBs was six times higher than in nucleocapsid structures. Biochemical studies showed that recombinant VP40 represented a peripheral membrane protein that was stably associated with membranes by hydrophobic interaction. Recombinant VP40 was also found in association with membranes of MVBs and in filopodia- or lamellipodia-like protrusions at the cell surface. Antibodies against marker proteins of various cellular compartments showed that VP40-positive membranes contained Lamp-1 and the transferrin receptor, confirming that they belong to the late endosomal compartment. VP40-positive membranes were also associated with actin. Western blot analysis of purified MBGV structural proteins demonstrated trace amounts of actin, Lamp-1, and Rab11 (markers of recycling endosomes), while markers for other cellular compartments were absent. Our data indicate that MBGV VP40 was able to interact with membranes of late endosomes in the course of viral infection. This capability was independent of other MBGV proteins.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2002,NA

A 48-kDa polypeptide (RAF-2p48), a cellular splicing factor belonging to the DEAD-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases previously designated BAT1 (also UAP56), has now been identified as essential for RAF-2 stimulatory activity. Additionally, RAF-2p48 was independently identified as an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-interacting protein, NPI-5, in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mammalian cDNA library. In vitro, RAF-2p48 interacted with free NP but not with NP bound to RNA, and the RAF-2p48–NP complex was dissociated following addition of free RNA. Furthermore, RAF-2p48 facilitated formation of the NP-RNA complexes that likely serve as templates for the viral RNA polymerase. RAF-2p48 was shown, in both in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, to bind to the amino-terminal region of NP, a domain essential for RNA binding. Together, these observations suggest that RAF-2p48 facilitates NP-RNA interaction, thus leading to enhanced influenza virus RNA synthesis.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2001,NA

            Adenovirus E4orf4 protein has been shown to induce transformed cell-specific, protein phosphatase 2A-dependent, and p53-independent apoptosis. It has been further reported that the E4orf4 apoptotic pathway is caspase-independent in CHO cells. Here, we show that E4orf4 induces caspase activation in the human cell lines H1299 and 293T. Caspase activation is required for apoptosis in 293T cells, but not in H1299 cells. Dominant negative mutants of caspase-8 and the death receptor adapter protein FADD/MORT1 inhibit E4orf4-induced apoptosis in 293T cells, suggesting that E4orf4 activates the death receptor pathway.

Furthermore, E4orf4 induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a caspase-8- and FADD/MORT1-dependent manner, and inhibition of ROS generation by 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron) inhibits E4orf4-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results demonstrate that E4orf4 engages the death receptor pathway to generate at least part of the molecular events required for E4orf4-induced apoptosis.

          <jats:p>
            Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) is an important equine and human pathogen of the Americas. In the adult mouse model, cDNA-derived, virulent V3000 inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) causes high-titer peripheral replication followed by neuroinvasion and lethal encephalitis. A single change (G to A) at nucleotide 3 (nt 3) of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the V3000 genome resulted in a virus (V3043) that was avirulent in mice. The mechanism of attenuation by the V3043 mutation was studied in vivo and in vitro. Kinetic studies of virus spread in adult mice following s.c. inoculation showed that V3043 replication was reduced in peripheral organs compared to that of V3000, titers in serum also were lower, and V3043 was cleared more rapidly from the periphery than V3000. Because clearance of V3043 from serum began 1 to 2 days prior to clearance of V3000, we examined the involvement of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) activity in VEE pathogenesis. In IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the course of the wild-type disease was extremely rapid, with all animals dying within 48 h (average survival time of 30 h compared to 7.7 days in the wild-type mice). The mutant V3043 was as virulent as the wild type (100% mortality, average survival time of 30 h). Virus titers in serum, peripheral organs, and the brain were similar in V3000- and V3043-infected IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice at all time points up until the death of the animals. Consistent with the in vivo data, the mutant virus exhibited reduced growth in vitro in several cell types except in cells that lacked a functional IFN-α/β pathway. In cells derived from IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the mutant virus showed no growth disadvantage compared to the wild-type virus, suggesting that IFN-α/β plays a major role in the attenuation of V3043 compared to V3000. There were no differences in the induction of IFN-α/β between V3000 and V3043, but the mutant virus was more sensitive than V3000 to the antiviral actions of IFN-α/β in two separate in vitro assays, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to IFN-α/β plays a major role in the in vivo attenuation of V3043.

In contrast to the rest of the parvoviruses, the VP1u of B19 is thought to occupy an external position in the virion, making this region a promising candidate for vaccine development. By using a monoclonal antibody against the most-N-terminal portion of VP1u, we revealed that this region rich in neutralizing epitopes is not accessible in native capsids. However, exposure of capsids to increasing temperatures or low pH led to its progressive accessibility without particle disassembly. Although unable to bind free virus or to block virus attachment to the cell, the anti-VP1u antibody was neutralizing, suggesting that the exposure of the epitope and the subsequent virus neutralization occur only after receptor attachment. The measurement of the VP1u-associated PLA

These results indicate that stretches of VP1u of native B19 capsids harboring neutralizing epitopes and essential functional motifs are not external to the capsid.

In this study, the effects of each substitution on the production of viral progeny, viral DNA replication, and DNA replication fidelity were examined.

Taking advantage of this system in the present study, we investigated whether HCV infection leads to superinfection exclusion, a state in which HCV-infected cells are resistant to secondary HCV infection. To discriminate between viral genomes, we inserted genes encoding fluorescent proteins in frame into the 3′-terminal NS5A coding region. These genomes replicated to wild-type levels and supported the production of infectious virus particles. Upon simultaneous infection of Huh-7 cells, coreplication of both viral genomes in the same cell was detected. However, when infections were performed sequentially, secondary infection was severely impaired. This superinfection exclusion was neither due to a reduction of cell surface expression of CD81 and scavenger receptor BI, two molecules implicated in HCV entry, nor due to a functional block at the level of virus entry. Instead, superinfection exclusion was mediated primarily by interference at the level of HCV RNA translation and, presumably, also replication. In summary, our results describe the construction and characterization of viable monocistronic HCV reporter genomes allowing detection of viral replication in infected living cells. By using these genomes, we found that HCV induces superinfection exclusion, which is primarily due to interference at a postentry step.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2007,NA

          <jats:p>The replication and pathogenicity of influenza A virus (FLUAV) are controlled in part by the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) system. This virus-host interplay is dependent on the production of IFN-α/β and on the capacity of the viral nonstructural protein NS1 to counteract the IFN system. Two different mechanisms have been described for NS1, namely, blocking the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and blocking posttranscriptional processing of cellular mRNAs. Here we directly compare the abilities of NS1 gene products from three different human FLUAV (H1N1) strains to counteract the antiviral host response. We found that A/PR/8/34 NS1 has a strong capacity to inhibit IRF3 and activation of the IFN-β promoter but is unable to suppress expression of other cellular genes. In contrast, the NS1 proteins of A/Tx/36/91 and of A/BM/1/18, the virus that caused the Spanish influenza pandemic, caused suppression of additional cellular gene expression. Thus, these NS1 proteins prevented the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral state, allowing virus replication even in the presence of IFN. Interestingly, the block in gene expression was dependent on a newly described NS1 domain that is important for interaction with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) component of the cellular pre-mRNA processing machinery but is not functional in A/PR/8/34 NS1. We identified the Phe-103 and Met-106 residues in NS1 as being critical for CPSF binding, together with the previously described C-terminal binding domain. Our results demonstrate the capacity of FLUAV NS1 to suppress the antiviral host defense at multiple levels and the existence of strain-specific differences that may modulate virus pathogenicity.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2007,NA

          <jats:p>Nearly a third of the human population is at risk of infection with the four serotypes of dengue viruses, and it is estimated that more than 100 million infections occur each year. A licensed vaccine for dengue viruses has become a global health priority. A major challenge to developing a dengue vaccine is the necessity to produce fairly uniform protective immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes. We have developed two bivalent dengue virus vaccines, using a complex adenovirus vector, by incorporating the genes expressing premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of dengue virus types 1 and 2 (dengue-1 and -2, respectively) (CAdVax-Den12) or dengue-3 and -4 (CAdVax-Den34). Rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular inoculation of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulated by combining the two bivalent vaccine constructs. Vaccinated animals produced high-titer antibodies that neutralized all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. The ability of the vaccine to induce rapid, as well as sustained, protective immune responses was examined with two separate live-virus challenges administered at 4 and 24 weeks after the final vaccination. For both of these virus challenge studies, significant protection from viremia was demonstrated for all four dengue virus serotypes in vaccinated animals. Viremia from dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges was completely blocked, whereas viremia from dengue-2 and dengue-4 was significantly reduced, as well as delayed, compared to that of control-vaccinated animals. These results demonstrate that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four dengue virus serotypes.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2008,NA

            XXC, in the C-terminal domain SU. Here we have tested whether this motif is used for isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide of Env and whether this rearrangement is required for membrane fusion. We introduced the C225A and C228A mutations into Env and found that the former but not the latter mutant matured into covalently linked SU-TM complexes in transfected cells. Next, we constructed a secreted Env ectodomain and showed that it underwent incubation-dependent intersubunit disulfide isomerization on target cells. However, the rearrangement was blocked by the C225A mutation, suggesting that C
            <jats:sub>225</jats:sub>
            carried the isomerization-active thiol. Still, it was possible to reduce the intersubunit disulfide of the native C225A ectodomain mutant with dithiothreitol (DTT). The importance of the CXXC-mediated disulfide isomerization for infection was studied using murine leukemia virus vectors pseudotyped with wild-type or C225A HTLV-1 Env. We found that the mutant Env blocked infection, but this could be rescued with DTT. The fusion activity was tested in a fusion-from-within assay using a coculture of rat XC target and transfected BHK-21 effector cells. We found that the mutation blocked polykaryon formation, but this could be reversed with DTT. Similar DTT-reversible inhibition of infection and fusion was observed when a membrane-impermeable alkylator was present during the infection/fusion incubation. We conclude that the fusion activity of HTLV-1 Env is controlled by an SU CXXC-mediated isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide. Thus, this extends the applicability of the isomerization model from gammaretroviruses to deltaretroviruses.

            The measles virus (MV) accessory proteins V and C play important roles in MV replication and pathogenesis. Infection with recombinant MV lacking either V or C causes more cell death than infection with the parental vaccine-equivalent virus (MVvac), and C-deficient virus grows poorly relative to the parental virus. Here, we show that a major effector of the C phenotype is the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Using human HeLa cells stably deficient in PKR as a result of RNA interference-mediated knockdown (PKR

Furthermore, the results establish that a principal function of the MV C protein is to antagonize the proapoptotic and antiviral activities of PKR.

            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -Golgi network membranes. This process is facilitated by interactions among the carboxyl termini of viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins. To directly investigate the relative importance of the carboxyl terminus of glycoprotein D (gD) in the presence or absence of gE, a recombinant virus (gDΔct) was constructed to specify a truncated gD lacking the carboxy-terminal 29 amino acids. Furthermore, two additional recombinant viruses were constructed by mutating from ATG to CTG the initiation codons of gE (gEctg) or both gE and gM (gEctg+gMctg), causing lack of expression of gE or both gE and gM, respectively. A fourth mutant virus was constructed to specify the gEctg+gDΔct mutations. The replication properties of these viruses were compared to those of a newly constructed recombinant virus unable to express UL20 due to alteration of the two initiation codons of UL20 (UL20ctgctg). All recombinant viruses were constructed by using the double-Red, site-directed mutagenesis system implemented on the HSV-1(F) genome cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. The gEctg, gEctg+gMctg, gDΔct, and gEctg+gDΔct viruses produced viral plaques on African monkey kidney cells (Vero), as well as other cells, that were on average approximately 30 to 50% smaller than those produced by the wild-type virus HSV-1(F). In contrast, the UL20ctgctg virus produced very small plaques containing three to five cells, as reported previously for the ΔUL20 virus lacking the entire UL20 gene. Viral replication kinetics of intracellular and extracellular viruses revealed that all recombinant viruses produced viral titers similar to those produced by the wild-type HSV-1(F) virus intracellularly and extracellularly at late times postinfection, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which replicated more than two-and-a-half logs less efficiently than HSV-1(F). Electron microscopy confirmed that all viruses, regardless of their different gene mutations, efficiently produced enveloped virions within infected cells, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which accumulated high levels of unenveloped virions in the cytoplasm. These results show that the carboxyl terminus of gD and the full-length gE, either alone or in a redundant manner, are not essential in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and egress from infected cells. Similarly, gM and gE do not function alone or in a redundant manner in cytoplasmic envelopment and virion egress, confirming previous findings.

          <jats:p>To explore mechanisms of entry for Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) pseudotyped virions, we used comparative gene analysis to identify genes whose expression correlated with viral transduction. Candidate genes were identified by using EBOV GP pseudotyped virions to transduce human tumor cell lines that had previously been characterized by cDNA microarray. Transduction profiles for each of these cell lines were generated, and a significant positive correlation was observed between RhoC expression and permissivity for EBOV vector transduction. This correlation was not specific for EBOV vector alone as RhoC also correlated highly with transduction of vesicular stomatitis virus GP (VSVG) pseudotyped vector. Levels of RhoC protein in EBOV and VSV permissive and nonpermissive cells were consistent with the cDNA gene array findings. Additionally, vector transduction was elevated in cells that expressed high levels of endogenous RhoC but not RhoA. RhoB and RhoC overexpression significantly increased EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped vector transduction but had minimal effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) GP pseudotyped HIV or adeno-associated virus 2 vector entry, indicating that not all virus uptake was enhanced by expression of these molecules. RhoB and RhoC overexpression also significantly enhanced VSV infection. Similarly, overexpression of RhoC led to a significant increase in fusion of EBOV virus-like particles. Finally, ectopic expression of RhoC resulted in increased nonspecific endocytosis of fluorescent dextran and in formation of increased actin stress fibers compared to RhoA-transfected cells, suggesting that RhoC is enhancing macropinocytosis. In total, our studies implicate RhoB and RhoC in enhanced productive entry of some pseudovirions and suggest the involvement of actin-mediated macropinocytosis as a mechanism of uptake of EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped viral particles.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2009,NA

            Insulin degradation enzyme (IDE) is a 110-kDa zinc metalloprotease found in the cytosol of all cells. IDE degrades insulin and a variety of small proteins including amyloid-β. Recently, IDE has been proposed as the receptor for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) attachment. During our reassessment, some of the original studies were repeated and expanded in scope. We first confirmed that IDE antibody reduced VZV spread. For additional controls, we repeated the same experiments with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells as well as uninfected cells. There was a visible reduction in HSV spread but less than seen in the VZV system. Of greater importance, IDE antibody also inhibited the growth of uninfected cells. Second, we repeated the coprecipitation assays. We confirmed that antibodies to VZV gE (open reading frame 68) coprecipitated IDE and that anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated gE. However, the detected gE protein was not the mature 98-kDa form; rather, it was a precursor 73-kDa gE form found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional control experiments included VZV-infected cell cultures treated with tunicamycin to block gE glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum; again, the anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated a 73-kDa gE product. Finally, Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis of a chromatographically purified gE sample revealed four cellular proteins associated with the unfolded protein response: BiP (HSPA5), HSPA8, HSPD1, and PPIA (peptidyl-propyl

          <jats:p>Central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) takes three clinical forms: meningitis (TBM), intracranial tuberculoma, and spinal arachnoiditis. TBM predominates in the western world and presents as a subacute to chronic meningitis syndrome with a prodrome of malaise, fever, and headache progressing to altered mentation and focal neurologic signs, followed by stupor, coma, and death within five to eight weeks of onset. The CSF formula typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and low glucose and high protein concentrations. Diagnosis rests on serial samples of CSF for smear and culture, combined with CSF PCR. Brain CT and MRI aid in diagnosis, assessment for complications, and monitoring of the clinical course. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of TBM. Vasculitis leading to infarcts in the basal ganglia occurs commonly and is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Treatment is most effective when started in the early stages of disease, and should be initiated promptly on the basis of strong clinical suspicion without waiting for laboratory confirmation. The initial 4 drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) covers the possibility of infection with a resistant strain, maximizes antimicrobial impact, and reduces the likelihood of emerging resistance on therapy. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in all but late stage disease.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA

          <jats:p>In HIV-infected individuals, paradoxical reactions after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with a variety of underlying infections and have been called the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In cases of IRIS associated with tuberculosis (TB), two distinct patterns of disease are recognized: (i) the progression of subclinical TB to clinical disease after the initiation of ART, referred to as unmasking, and (ii) the progression or appearance of new clinical and/or radiographic disease in patients with previously recognized TB after the initiation of ART, the classic or “paradoxical” TB-IRIS. IRIS can potentially occur in all granulomatous diseases, not just infectious ones. All granulomatous diseases are thought to result from interplay of inflammatory cells and mediators. One of the inflammatory cells thought to be integral to the development of the granuloma is the CD4 T lymphocyte. Therefore, HIV-infected patients with noninfectious granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis may also develop IRIS reactions. Here, we describe IRIS in HIV-infected patients with TB and sarcoidosis and review the basic clinical and immunological aspects of these phenomena.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA

            . RNAs of this class selectively bind a specific cognate tRNA, utilizing recognition of the tRNA anticodon and other tRNA features. The riboswitch monitors the aminoacylation status of the tRNA to induce expression of the regulated downstream gene(s) at the level of transcription antitermination or derepression of translation initiation in response to reduced tRNA charging via stabilization of an antiterminator or antisequestrator. Recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed new features of tRNA recognition that extend beyond the initially identified Watson-Crick base-pairing of a codon-like sequence in the riboswitch with the tRNA anticodon, and residues in the antiterminator or antisequestrator with the tRNA acceptor end. These studies have revealed new tRNA contacts and new modes of riboswitch function and ligand recognition that expand our understanding of RNA-RNA recognition and the biological roles of tRNA.

            Several pathogens have evolved to infect host cells from within, which requires subversion of many host intracellular processes. In the case of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, adaptation to an intracellular life cycle relies largely on the activity of type III secretion systems (T3SSs), an apparatus used to deliver effector proteins into the host cell, from where these effectors regulate important cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton reorganization, and the innate immune response. Each bacterium is equipped with a unique suite of these T3SS effectors, which aid in the development of an individual intracellular lifestyle for their respective pathogens. Some bacteria adapt to reside and propagate within a customized vacuole, while others establish a replicative niche in the host cytosol. In this article, we review the mechanisms by which T3SS effectors contribute to these different lifestyles. To illustrate the formation of a vacuolar and a cytosolic lifestyle, we discuss the intracellular habitats of the enteric pathogens

          <jats:p>In addition to SecA of the general Sec system, many Gram-positive bacteria, including mycobacteria, express SecA2, a second, transport-associated ATPase. SecA2s can be subdivided into two mechanistically distinct types: (i) SecA2s that are part of the accessory Sec (aSec) system, a specialized transporter mediating the export of a family of serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins that function as adhesins, and (ii) SecA2s that are part of multisubstrate systems, in which SecA2 interacts with components of the general Sec system, specifically the SecYEG channel, to export multiple types of substrates. Found mainly in streptococci and staphylococci, the aSec system also contains SecY2 and novel accessory Sec proteins (Asps) that are required for optimal export. Asp2 also acetylates glucosamine residues on the SRR domains of the substrate during transport. Targeting of the SRR substrate to SecA2 and the aSec translocon is mediated by a specialized signal peptide. Multisubstrate SecA2 systems are present in mycobacteria, corynebacteria, listeriae, clostridia, and some bacillus species. Although most substrates for this SecA2 have canonical signal peptides that are required for export, targeting to SecA2 appears to depend on structural features of the mature protein. The feature of the mature domains of these proteins that renders them dependent on SecA2 for export may be their potential to fold in the cytoplasm. The discovery of aSec and multisubstrate SecA2 systems expands our appreciation of the diversity of bacterial export pathways. Here we present our current understanding of the mechanisms of each of these SecA2 systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2019,NA

            Malaria is a vector-borne disease that involves multiple parasite species in a variety of ecological settings. However, the parasite species causing the disease, the prevalence of subclinical infections, the emergence of drug resistance, the scale-up of interventions, and the ecological factors affecting malaria transmission, among others, are aspects that vary across areas where malaria is endemic. Such complexities have propelled the study of parasite genetic diversity patterns in the context of epidemiologic investigations. Importantly, molecular studies indicate that the time and spatial distribution of malaria cases reflect epidemiologic processes that cannot be fully understood without characterizing the evolutionary forces shaping parasite population genetic patterns. Although broad in scope, this review in the

            Discontinuity of both strands of the chromosome is a lethal event in all living organisms because it compromises chromosome replication. As such, a diversity of DNA repair systems has evolved to repair double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In part, this diversity of DSB repair systems has evolved to repair breaks that arise in diverse physiologic circumstances or sequence contexts, including cellular states of nonreplication or breaks that arise between repeats. Mycobacteria elaborate a set of three genetically distinct DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining, and single-strand annealing. As such, mycobacterial DSB repair diverges substantially from the standard model of prokaryotic DSB repair and represents an attractive new model system. In addition, the presence in mycobacteria of a DSB repair system that can repair DSBs in nonreplicating cells (nonhomologous end joining) or when DSBs arise between repeats (single-strand annealing) has clear potential relevance to

          <jats:p>Although most of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are incorporated in the host genome almost randomly, some non-LTR retrotransposons are incorporated into specific sequences within a target site. On the basis of structural and phylogenetic features, non-LTR retrotransposons are classified into two large groups, restriction enzyme-like endonuclease (RLE)-encoding elements and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)-encoding elements. All clades of RLE-encoding non-LTR retrotransposons include site-specific elements. However, only two of more than 20 APE-encoding clades, Tx1 and R1, contain site-specific non-LTR elements. Site-specific non-LTR retrotransposons usually target within multi-copy RNA genes, such as rRNA gene (rDNA) clusters, or repetitive genomic sequences, such as telomeric repeats; this behavior may be a symbiotic strategy to reduce the damage to the host genome. Site- and sequence-specificity are variable even among closely related non-LTR elements and appeared to have changed during evolution. In the APE-encoding elements, the primary determinant of the sequence- specific integration is APE itself, which nicks one strand of the target DNA during the initiation of target primed reverse transcription (TPRT). However, other factors, such as interaction between mRNA and the target DNA, and access to the target region in the nuclei also affect the sequence-specificity. In contrast, in the RLE-encoding elements, DNA-binding motifs appear to affect their sequence-specificity, rather than the RLE domain itself. Highly specific integration properties of these site-specific non-LTR elements make them ideal alternative tools for sequence-specific gene delivery, particularly for therapeutic purposes in human diseases.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2015,NA

          <jats:p>Plasmids confer genetic information that benefits the bacterial cells containing them. In pathogenic bacteria, plasmids often harbor virulence determinants that enhance the pathogenicity of the bacterium. The ability to acquire iron in environments where it is limited, for instance the eukaryotic host, is a critical factor for bacterial growth. To acquire iron, bacteria have evolved specific iron uptake mechanisms. These systems are often chromosomally encoded, while those that are plasmid-encoded are rare. Two main plasmid types, ColV and pJM1, have been shown to harbor determinants that increase virulence by providing the cell with essential iron for growth. It is clear that these two plasmid groups evolved independently from each other since they do not share similarities either in the plasmid backbones or in the iron uptake systems they harbor. The siderophores aerobactin and salmochelin that are found on ColV plasmids fall in the hydroxamate and catechol group, respectively, whereas both functional groups are present in the anguibactin siderophore, the only iron uptake system found on pJM1-type plasmids. Besides siderophore-mediated iron uptake, ColV plasmids carry additional genes involved in iron metabolism. These systems include ABC transporters, hemolysins, and a hemoglobin protease. ColV- and pJM1-like plasmids have been shown to confer virulence to their bacterial host, and this trait can be completely ascribed to their encoded iron uptake systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2014,NA

As the recent Ebola virus disease and MERS-CoV outbreaks demonstrate, the modern epidemics and large-scale infectious outbreaks emerge and spread quickly. Air transportation is a major vehicle for the rapid spread and dissemination of communicable diseases, and there have been a number of reported outbreaks of serious airborne diseases aboard commercial flights including tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, smallpox, and measles, to name a few. In 2014 alone, over 3.3 billion passengers (a number equivalent to 42% of the world population) and 50 million metric tons of cargo traveled by air from 41,000 airports and 50,000 routes worldwide, and significant growth is anticipated, with passenger numbers expected to reach 5.9 billion by 2030. Given the increasing numbers of travelers, the risk of infectious disease transmission during air travel is a significant concern, and this chapter focuses on the current knowledge about transmission of infectious diseases in the context of both transmissions within the aircraft passenger cabin and commercial aircraft serving as vehicles of worldwide infection spread.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2015,NA

Subsequent years have seen a greater understanding of all aspects of this viral infection. The North American epidemic resulted in a further understanding of the virology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and epidemiology of WNV infection. Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic people experience an acute systemic febrile illness; less than 1% of infected people develop neuroinvasive disease, which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or anterior myelitis resulting in acute flaccid paralysis. Older age is associated with more severe illness and higher mortality; other risk factors for poor outcome have been challenging to identify. In addition to natural infection through mosquito bites, transfusion- and organ transplant–associated infections have occurred.

            To survive adverse conditions, some bacterial species are capable of developing into a cell type, the “spore,” which exhibits minimal metabolic activity and remains viable in the presence of multiple environmental challenges. For some pathogenic bacteria, this developmental state serves as a means of survival during transmission from one host to another. Spores are the highly infectious form of these bacteria. Upon entrance into a host, specific signals facilitate germination into metabolically active replicating organisms, resulting in disease pathogenesis. In this article, we will review spore structure and function in well-studied pathogens of two genera,

          <jats:p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most deadly bacterial infectious disease worldwide. Its treatment and control are threatened by increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or nearly untreatable extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. New concepts are therefore urgently needed to understand the factors driving the TB epidemics and the spread of different strain populations, especially in association with drug resistance. Classical genotyping and, more recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the world population of tubercle bacilli is more diverse than previously thought. Several major phylogenetic lineages can be distinguished, which are associated with their sympatric host population. Distinct clonal (sub)populations can even coexist within infected patients. WGS is now used as the ultimate approach for differentiating clinical isolates and for linking phenotypic to genomic variation from lineage to strain levels. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the genetic diversity of TB strains translates into pathobiological consequences, and key molecular mechanisms probably involved in differential pathoadaptation of some main lineages have recently been identified. Evidence also accumulates on molecular mechanisms putatively fostering the emergence and rapid expansion of particular MDR and XDR strain groups in some world regions. However, further integrative studies will be needed for complete elucidation of the mechanisms that allow the pathogen to infect its host, acquire multidrug resistance, and transmit so efficiently. Such knowledge will be key for the development of the most effective new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccination strategies.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2016,NA

          <jats:p>The modulation of tuberculosis (TB)-induced immunopathology caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coinfection remains incompletely understood but underlies the change seen in the natural history, presentation, and prognosis of TB in such patients. The deleterious combination of these two pathogens has been dubbed a “deadly syndemic,” with each favoring the replication of the other and thereby contributing to accelerated disease morbidity and mortality. HIV-1 is the best-recognized risk factor for the development of active TB and accounts for 13% of cases globally. The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has considerably mitigated this risk. Rapid roll-out of ART globally and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate ART for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count should lead to further reductions in HIV-1-associated TB incidence because susceptibility to TB is inversely proportional to CD4 count. However, it is important to note that even after successful ART, patients with HIV-1 are still at increased risk for TB. Indeed, in settings of high TB incidence, the occurrence of TB often remains the first presentation of, and thereby the entry into, HIV care. As advantageous as ART-induced immune recovery is, it may also give rise to immunopathology, especially in the lower-CD4-count strata in the form of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome will continue to impact the HIV-TB syndemic.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2016,NA

Urogenital tuberculosis occurs at all age ranges, but it is predominant in males in their fourth and fifth decades. It is a serious, insidious disease, generally developing symptoms only at a late stage, which leads to a diagnostic delay with consequent urogenital organ destruction; there are reports of patients with renal failure as their initial clinical presentation. Although the condition has been long recognized by nephrologists, urologists, and infectious disease specialists, urogenital tuberculosis is still largely unknown. Even when suggestive findings such as hematuria, sterile pyuria, and recurrent urinary infections are present, we rarely remember this diagnostic possibility. Greater knowledge of the features of urogenital tuberculosis then becomes relevant and should emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA

Furthermore, endocrine and metabolic abnormalities do not always reflect direct infection of the gland but may result from physiological response or as a consequence of therapy. Metabolic disease may also predispose patients to the development of active tuberculosis, particularly in the case of diabetes mellitus. While hormonal therapy may be necessary in some instances, frequently these endocrine complications do not require specific interventions other than antituberculous therapy itself. With the exception of diabetes mellitus, which will be covered elsewhere, this chapter reviews the endocrinologic and metabolic issues related to tuberculosis.

          <jats:p>The molecular composition of the cell wall is critical for the biology and ecology of each fungal species. Fungal walls are composed of matrix components that are embedded and linked to scaffolds of fibrous load-bearing polysaccharides. Most of the major cell wall components of fungal pathogens are not represented in humans, other mammals, or plants, and therefore the immune systems of animals and plants have evolved to recognize many of the conserved elements of fungal walls. For similar reasons the enzymes that assemble fungal cell wall components are excellent targets for antifungal chemotherapies and fungicides. However, for fungal pathogens, the cell wall is often disguised since key signature molecules for immune recognition are sometimes masked by immunologically inert molecules. Cell wall damage leads to the activation of sophisticated fail-safe mechanisms that shore up and repair walls to avoid catastrophic breaching of the integrity of the surface. The frontiers of research on fungal cell walls are moving from a descriptive phase defining the underlying genes and component parts of fungal walls to more dynamic analyses of how the various components are assembled, cross-linked, and modified in response to environmental signals. This review therefore discusses recent advances in research investigating the composition, synthesis, and regulation of cell walls and how the cell wall is targeted by immune recognition systems and the design of antifungal diagnostics and therapeutics.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA,2017,NA

Membrane proteins possessing an unfavorable distribution of positively charged residues were significantly more likely to depend on YidC for membrane insertion. Correcting the charge distribution of a charge-unbalanced YidC-dependent membrane protein abrogated its requirement for YidC, while perturbing the charge distribution of a charge-balanced YidC-independent membrane protein rendered it YidC dependent, demonstrating that charge distribution can be a necessary and sufficient determinant of YidC dependence. These findings provide insights into a mechanism by which YidC promotes proper membrane protein biogenesis and suggest a critical function of YidC in all organisms and organelles that express it.

            Biological membranes are fundamental components of cells, providing barriers that enclose the cell and separate compartments. Proteins inserted into biological membranes serve critical functions in molecular transport, molecular partitioning, and other essential cell processes. The mechanisms involved in the insertion of proteins into membranes, however, are incompletely understood. The YidC protein is critical for the insertion of a subset of proteins into membranes across an evolutionarily wide group of organisms. Here we identify a large group of proteins that depend on YidC for membrane insertion in

            The anti-σ factor NepR plays a central role in regulation of the general stress response (GSR) in alphaproteobacteria. This small protein has two known interaction partners: its cognate extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor and the anti-anti-σ factor, PhyR. Stress-dependent phosphorylation of PhyR initiates a protein partner switch that promotes phospho-PhyR binding to NepR, which frees ECF σ to activate transcription of genes required for cell survival under adverse or fluctuating conditions. We have defined key functional roles for structured and intrinsically disordered domains of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Caulobacter crescentus</jats:named-content>
            NepR in partner binding and activation of GSR transcription. We further demonstrate that NepR strongly stimulates the rate of PhyR phosphorylation
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and that this effect requires the structured and disordered domains of NepR. This result provides evidence for an additional layer of GSR regulation in which NepR directly influences activation of its binding partner, PhyR, as an anti-anti-σ factor. We conclude that structured and intrinsically disordered domains of NepR coordinately control multiple functions in the GSR signaling pathway, including core protein partner switch interactions and pathway activation by phosphorylation.

            Anti-σ factors are key molecular participants in a range of adaptive responses in bacteria. The anti-σ factor NepR plays a vital role in a multiprotein partner switch that governs general stress response (GSR) transcription in alphaproteobacteria. We have defined conserved and unconserved features of NepR structure that determine its function as an anti-σ factor and uncovered a functional role for intrinsically disordered regions of NepR in partner binding events required for GSR activation. We further demonstrate a novel function for NepR as an enhancer of PhyR phosphorylation; this activity also requires the disordered domains of NepR. Our results provide evidence for a new layer of GSR regulatory control in which NepR directly modulates PhyR phosphorylation and, hence, activation of the GSR.

            Despite significant advances in health care, outbreaks of infections by enteroviruses (EVs) continue to plague the Asia-Pacific region every year. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), for which there are currently no therapeutics. Here, we report two new antibodies, A9 and D6, that potently neutralize EV71. A9 exhibited a 50% neutralizing concentration (neut

            ) value of 0.1 nM against EV71, which was 10-fold lower than that observed for D6. Investigation into the mechanisms of neutralization revealed that binding of A9 to EV71 blocks receptor binding but also destabilizes and damages the virus capsid structure. In contrast, D6 destabilizes the capsid only slightly but interferes more potently with the attachment of the virus to the host cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of A9 and D6 bound with EV71 shed light on the locations and nature of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies. Although some regions of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies overlap, there are differences that give rise to dissimilarities in potency as well as in the mechanisms of neutralization. Interestingly, the overlapping regions of the epitopes encompass the site that the virus uses to bind SCARB2, explaining the reason for the observed blocking of the virus-receptor interaction by the two antibodies. We also identified structural elements that might play roles in modulating the stability of the EV71 particles, including particle integrity. The molecular features of the A9 and D6 epitopes unveiled in this study open up new avenues for rationally designing antiviral drugs.

            During the course of viral infections, the human body produces neutralizing antibodies which play a defining role in clearing the virus. From this study, we report two new, highly potent neutralizing antibodies, A9 and D6, against enterovirus 71 (EV71), the causative agent of HFMD. Both antibodies prevent the virus from entering the host cell, a step that is important for establishing a successful infection. A9 destabilizes and damages the virus capsid that forms an outer protective covering around the genome of the virus, while also interfering with virus attachment to the host cells. In contrast, D6 only prevents binding of the virus to its receptor(s). The mechanism of neutralization of A9 is unique and has not been observed before for neutralizing antibodies targeting EVs. The two antibodies that we are reporting in this study have potential to be developed into much-needed therapeutic interventions for treatment of HFMD, outbreaks of which are reported every year in the Asia-Pacific region.

Consistent with that hypothesis, ergosterol-containing liposomes but not ergosterol-free liposomes induce pyroptosis. Cell wall mannoproteins directly bind ergosterol, and we found that Dan1, an ergosterol receptor mannoprotein, as well as specific mannosyltransferases, is required for pyroptosis, suggesting that cell wall-associated ergosterol may mediate the process. Taken together, these data indicate that ergosterol, like mammalian cholesterol, plays a direct role in yeast-mediated pyroptosis.

Ergosterol is also present in the fungal cell wall, most likely associated with mannoproteins, and is increased in hyphal cells compared to yeast cells. Our data indicate that specific mannoproteins are required for pyroptosis. This is consistent with a potential mechanism whereby ergosterol present in the outer mannoprotein layer of the cell wall is accessible to the macrophage-mediated process. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that ergosterol plays a direct role in the host-pathogen interactions of fungi.

HAECs treated with β-toxin displayed granular membrane morphology not seen in treatment with the SMase-deficient mutant. The altered morphology resulted in two possibly separable activities, cell rounding and redistribution of cell membranes into granules, which were not the result of endosome production from the Golgi apparatus or lysosomes. β-Toxin directly aggregated rabbit platelets via SMase activity.

We further show that this strategy for intracellular dissemination does not depend on flagellin and resists both host actin and host microtubule disruption. This differs from mechanisms used by previously studied pathogens that utilize either host actin or microtubules for intracellular dissemination independently of microbe motility appendages.

Here, we demonstrate that HIV infection is additionally associated with severely compromised antibody responses, particularly in individuals with active TB. Moreover, despite the influence of HIV infection, antibody profiles still allow accurate classification of individuals with active versus latent TB.

            = 0.969). Exponential-phase cells were used to inoculate cellulose discs for integration into an in vitro wound model that incorporated a reservoir of serum. A significant linear correlation was found between bioluminescence (photon counts monitored by a low-light camera) and viable counts in this growth environment (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            = 0.982). Three antimicrobial wound dressings were applied to the surface of freshly prepared sample discs within the wound model, and the kill kinetics were codetermined by photon and viable counts. Quantifiable kill rates gave the same order of efficacy for the three wound dressings using both types of measurement, and a significant linear correlation was shown between photon and viable counts (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            = 0.873) within this killing environment. Under all defined conditions, a significant linear correlation between bioluminescence and viable counts was shown but the actual slope of the correlation was different, depending on the physicochemical environment of the cells. Hence, significantly more light per cell (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001) was produced when cells in discs were exposed to a killing environment compared to a growing environment. As long as defined conditions are employed, the resulting linear correlation enables the state of the system to be continually monitored without disturbance, allowing more immediate and accurate calculations of kill rates without the need for viable counting.

            (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) have become increasingly common. This study's objectives were to describe the clinical spectrum of MRSA in a community health center and to determine whether the use of specific antimicrobials correlated with increased probability of clinical resolution of SSTI. A retrospective chart review of 399 sequential cases of culture-confirmed
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            SSTI, including 227 cases of MRSA SSTI, among outpatients at Fenway Community Health (Boston, MA) from 1998 to 2005 was done. The proportion of
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            SSTI due to MRSA increased significantly from 1998 to 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). Resistance to clindamycin was common (48.2% of isolates). At the beginning of the study period, most patients with MRSA SSTI empirically treated with antibiotics received a beta-lactam, whereas by 2005, 76% received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). Initially, few MRSA isolates were sensitive to the empirical antibiotic, but 77% were susceptible by 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of patients with MRSA isolates had clinical resolution on the empirical antibiotic by 2005 (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.037). Use of an empirical antibiotic to which the clinical isolate was sensitive was associated with increased odds of clinical resolution on empirical therapy (odds ratio = 5.91), controlling for incision and drainage and HIV status. MRSA now accounts for the majority of SSTI due to
            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
            at Fenway, and improved rates of clinical resolution on empirical antibiotic therapy have paralleled increasing use of empirical TMP-SMX for these infections. TMP-SMX appears to be an appropriate empirical antibiotic for suspected MRSA SSTI, especially where clindamycin resistance is common.

To explore the features of disease and the response to infection, we measured host gene expression in conjunctival samples from Gambian children with active trachoma and healthy controls. Genome-wide expression and transcription network analysis identified signatures characteristic of the expected infiltrating immune cell populations, such as neutrophils and T/B lymphocytes. The expression signatures were also significantly enriched for genes in pathways which regulate NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, antigen processing and presentation, chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. The data suggest that in addition to polymorph and adaptive cellular responses, NK cells may contribute to a significant component of the conjunctival inflammatory response to chlamydial infection.

            malaria would significantly improve the health and quality of the lives of more than 1 billion people around the world. A subunit vaccine is the only option in the absence of long-term culture of
            <jats:italic>P. vivax</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Plasmodium</jats:italic>
            sporozoites is one of the best-studied malarial antigens and the most promising vaccine in clinical trials. We report here the development of a novel ‚Äúimmunologically optimal‚Äù recombinant vaccine expressed in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            that encodes a chimeric CS protein encompassing repeats from the two major alleles, VK210 and VK247. This molecule is widely recognized by sera from patients naturally exposed to
            <jats:italic>P. vivax</jats:italic>
            infection and induces a highly potent immune response in genetically disparate strains of mice. Antibodies from immunized animals recognize both VK210 and VK247 sporozoites. Furthermore, these antibodies appear to be protective in nature since they cause the agglutination of live sporozoites, an in vitro surrogate of sporozoite infectivity. These results strongly suggest that recombinant CS is biologically active and highly immunogenic across major histocompatibility complex strains and raises the prospect that in humans this vaccine may induce protective immune responses.

Plate culturing, flow cytometry, and laser confocal microscopy of spleen homogenates throughout infection revealed three discernible stages of infection. The early phase was characterized by the presence of a small number of intracellular bacteria mostly within CD11b
            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>
            macrophages and Ly-6G

            neutrophils. These bacteria were not viable, as determined by plate culturing of spleen homogenates, until day 2 postinfection. Between days 2 and 4 postinfection, a plateau phase was observed, with bacterial burdens of 10

            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>
            macrophages. The late phase of infection, between days 4 and 5 postinfection, was characterized by a rapid increase in bacterial numbers, as well as escape of bacteria into the extracellular compartment. Annexin V staining of spleens indicated that a large proportion of splenic neutrophils underwent rapid apoptosis on days 1 and 2 postinfection. Fewer macrophages underwent apoptosis during the same period. Our data suggest that during the early stages of
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            infection, splenic neutrophils are responsible for limiting the growth of
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            and that splenic macrophages provide safe intracellular shelters within which
            <jats:italic>Y. pestis</jats:italic>
            is able to grow and escape during the later stages of infection. This macrophage compliance can be overcome in vitro by stimulation with a combination of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Owing to its lumenal pH (‚àº5) and fusion with endolysosomal vesicles, the PV is considered phagolysosome-like. However, the degradative properties of the mature PV are unknown, and there are conflicting reports on the maturation state and growth permissiveness of PV harboring virulent phase I or avirulent phase II

Here, we employed infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and THP-1 cells as host cells to directly compare the PV maturation kinetics and pathogen growth in cells infected with the Nine Mile phase I variant (NMI) or phase II variant (NMII) of
            <jats:italic>C. burnetii</jats:italic>

HMDMs infected by either phase variant secreted similar amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In infected THP-1 cells, equal percentages of NMI and NMII PVs decorate with the early endosomal marker Rab5, the late endosomal/lysosomal markers Rab7 and CD63, and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D at early (8 h) and late (72 h) time points postinfection (p.i.).

            is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, but it also frequently colonizes the human skin and mucosa without causing clinical symptoms. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin that has been associated with soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. We have compared the genotypes, virulence gene repertoires, and phage patterns of 74 furunculosis isolates with those of 108 control strains from healthy nasal carriers. The large majority of furunculosis strains were methicillin sensitive. Clonal cluster (CC) 121 (CC121) and CC22 accounted for 70% of the furunculosis strains but for only 8% of the nasal isolates. The PVL-encoding genes
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            were detected in 85% of furunculosis strains, while their prevalence among colonizing

            strains was below 1%.
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>
            genes were distributed over several lineages (CCs 5, 8, 22, 30, and 121 and sequence type 59). Even within the same lineages,
            <jats:italic>luk-PV</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>mec</jats:italic>
            and accessory gene regulator group genotyping by multiplex PCR, and identification of toxin and potential virulence factor genes via PCR-based assays. Of 8,387 neonates, 115 (1.4%) had MRSA colonization and/or infection. The MRSA colonization rate declined significantly during the study period from 2.2 to 0.5/1,000 patient days (linear time,

            = 0.006). There were 19 cases of MRSA infection (16.5%). Few epidemiologic or clinical differences were identified between MRSA-colonized and MRSA-infected infants. Thirty-one different strains of MRSA were identified with a shift from hospital-associated to combined hospital- and community-associated strains over time.

Continued vigilance for this invasive pathogen remains critical, and specific attention to the unique host, the neonate, and the distinct environment, the NICU, is imperative.

            (MRSA) infections has changed worldwide. From being strictly nosocomial, MRSA is now frequently found as a community-associated (CA) pathogen. Denmark has been a low-prevalence country for MRSA since the mid-1970s but has in recent years experienced an increasing number of CA-MRSA cases. The aim of this study was to describe the emergence of CA-MRSA infections in Denmark. All Danish MRSA specimens and corresponding clinical data from 1999 to 2006 were investigated. Isolates were analyzed by antibiotic resistance and molecular typing and were assigned to clonal complexes (CC). Clinical data were extracted from discharge summaries and general practitioners' notes, from which assessments of community association were made for all infected cases. CA-MRSA cases constituted 29.4% of all MRSA infections (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 1,790) and an increasing proportion of the annual numbers of MRSA infections during the study period. CA-MRSA was associated with a young age, skin and soft tissue infections, and non-Danish origin. Transmission between household members was frequently reported. Molecular typing showed &gt;60 circulating clones, where 89.4% of the isolates belonged to five CC (CC80, CC8, CC30, CC5, and CC22), 81.2% carried staphylococcal cassette chromosome

Resistance to ‚â•3 antibiotic classes was observed for 48.8% of the isolates. The emergence of CA-MRSA in Denmark was caused by diverse strains, both well-known and new CA-MRSA strains. The results suggest multiple introductions of MRSA as an important source for CA-MRSA infections in Denmark.

            ADE2. This edit leads to the buildup of an adenine precursor that dyes the edited cells red. As the repair template, guide RNA, and Cas9 are all encoded in our vector, transformation can be performed in 2 hours. Furthermore, since all components of the Cas9/CRISPR system are encoded by the vector, specialized equipment and reagents, such as a PCR machine or oligonucleotides, are not required to perform the experiments as designed. As such, these exercises provide an efficient cost-effective introduction to a wide variety of key molecular biology concepts and lay the foundation for more rigorous investigations in upper-level classes and independent research projects.

            The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established its ASM-NSF (National Science Foundation) Biology Scholars Program (BSP) to promote undergraduate education reform by 1) supporting biologists to implement evidence-based teaching practices, 2) engaging life science professional societies to facilitate biologists‚Äô leadership in scholarly teaching within the discipline, and 3) participating in a teaching community that fosters disciplinary-level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) reform. Since 2005, the program has utilized year-long residency training to provide a continuum of learning and practice centered on principles from the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to more than 270 participants (‚Äúscholars‚Äù) from biology and multiple other disciplines. Additionally, the program has recruited 11 life science professional societies to support faculty development in SoTL and discipline-based education research (DBER). To identify the BSP‚Äôs long-term outcomes and impacts, ASM engaged an external evaluator to conduct a study of the program‚Äôs 2010‚Äì2014 scholars (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 127) and society partners. The study methods included online surveys, focus groups, participant observation, and analysis of various documents. Study participants indicate that the program achieved its proposed goals relative to scholarship, professional society impact, leadership, community, and faculty professional development. Although participants also identified barriers that hindered elements of their BSP participation, findings suggest that the program was essential to their development as faculty and provides evidence of the BSP as a model for other societies seeking to advance undergraduate science education reform. The BSP is the longest-standing faculty development program sponsored by a collective group of life science societies. This collaboration promotes success across a fragmented system of more than 80 societies representing the life sciences and helps catalyze biology education reform efforts.

          <jats:p>The vaccinia virus (VACV) Lister strain was one of the vaccine strains that enabled smallpox eradication. Although the strain is most often harmless, there have been numerous incidents of mild to life-threatening accidents with this strain and others. In an attempt to further attenuate the Lister strain, we investigated the role of 5 genomic regions known to be deleted in the modified VACV Ankara (MVA) genome in virulence in immunodeficient mice, immunogenicity in immunocompetent mice, and vaccine efficacy in a cowpox virus challenge model. Lister mutants were constructed so as to delete each of the 5 regions or various combinations of these regions. All of the mutants replicated efficiently in tissue culture except region I mutants, which multiplied more poorly in human cells than the parental strain. Mutants with single deletions were not attenuated or only moderately so in athymic nude mice. Mutants with multiple deletions were more highly attenuated than those with single deletions. Deleting regions II, III, and V together resulted in total attenuation for nude mice and partial attenuation for SCID mice. In immunocompetent mice, the Lister deletion mutants induced VACV specific humoral responses equivalent to those of the parental strain but in some cases lower cell-mediated immune responses. All of the highly attenuated mutants protected mice from a severe cowpox virus challenge at low vaccine doses. The data suggest that several of the Lister mutants combining multiple deletions could be used in smallpox vaccination or as live virus vectors at doses equivalent to those used for the traditional vaccine while displaying increased safety.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2011,626

            infection leads to robust induction of an innate immune signaling pathway referred to as the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP), characterized by expression of beta interferon (IFN-Œ≤) and coregulated genes. We previously identified the IFN-Œ≤ stimulatory ligand as secreted cyclic di-AMP. Synthesis of c-di-AMP in
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            is catalyzed by the diadenylate cyclase DacA, and multidrug resistance transporters are necessary for secretion. To identify additional bacterial factors involved in
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            detection by the CSP, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutants that induced altered levels of IFN-Œ≤. One mutant that stimulated elevated levels of IFN-Œ≤ harbored a transposon insertion in the gene

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            and is able to degrade c-di-AMP to the linear dinucleotide pApA. Reduction of c-di-AMP levels by conditional depletion of the di-adenylate cyclase DacA or overexpression of PdeA led to marked decreases in growth rates, both
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and in macrophages. Additionally, mutants with altered levels of c-di-AMP had different susceptibilities to peptidoglycan-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that the molecule may be involved in regulating cell wall homeostasis. During intracellular infection, increases in c-di-AMP production led to hyperactivation of the CSP. Conditional depletion of
            <jats:italic>dacA</jats:italic>
            also led to increased IFN-Œ≤ expression and a concomitant increase in host cell pyroptosis, a result of increased bacteriolysis and subsequent bacterial DNA release. These data suggest that c-di-AMP coordinates bacterial growth, cell wall stability, and responses to stress and plays a crucial role in the establishment of bacterial infection.

            stimulates expression of IFN-Œ≤ and coregulated genes dependent upon host detection of a secreted bacterial signaling nucleotide, c-di-AMP. Using a forward genetic screen for mutants that induced high levels of host IFN-Œ≤ expression, we identified a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase, PdeA, that degrades c-di-AMP. Here we characterize
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. monocytogenes</jats:named-content>
            mutants that express enhanced or diminished levels of c-di-AMP. Decreased c-di-AMP levels by conditional depletion of the diadenylate cyclase (DacA) or overexpression of PdeA attenuated bacterial growth and led to bacteriolysis, suggesting that its production is essential for viability and may regulate cell wall metabolism. Mutants lacking PdeA had a distinct transcriptional profile, which may provide insight into additional roles for the molecule. This work demonstrates that c-di-AMP is a critical signaling molecule required for bacterial replication, cell wall stability, and pathogenicity.

LbpA is an integral outer membrane-embedded iron transporter, whereas LbpB is a cell surface-exposed lipoprotein. In this study, we demonstrate that LbpB is also released into the culture medium. We identified NalP, an autotransporter known to be involved in the processing of other autotransporters, as the protease responsible for LbpB release. This release of LbpB reduced the complement-mediated killing of the bacteria when incubated with an LbpB-specific bactericidal antiserum. Since antibodies directed against LbpB are found in convalescent-patient sera, the release of an immunogenic protein as LbpB may represent a novel means for
