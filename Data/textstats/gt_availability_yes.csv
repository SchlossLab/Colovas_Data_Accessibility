Partial sequence of the 26S rRNA gene yielded the best results in terms of correct identification, followed by classical techniques and 5.8S-ITS analysis. The commercial identification kits RapID Yeast Plus system and API 20C AUX were able to correctly identify only 35 and 13% of the isolates, respectively. Six new 5.8S-ITS profiles were described, corresponding to

            promoter. Using yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as the reporter, 33 mutants were chosen to form the functional promoter library. The 33 mutants spanned an activity range between ∼0.6% and 19.6-fold of the wild-type promoter activity with an almost linear fluorescence intensity distribution. After an extensive characterization of the library, the broader applicability of the results obtained with the yEGFP reporter was confirmed using two additional reporters (β-galactosidase and methionine adenosyltransferase [MAT]) at the transcription and enzyme activity levels. Furthermore, the utility of the promoter library was tested by investigating the influence of heterologous MAT gene expression levels on cell growth and
            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>

The extensive characterization of the promoter strength enabled identification of the optimal MAT activity (around 1.05 U/mg of protein) to obtain maximal volumetric SAM production. The promoter library permits precise control of gene expression and quantitative assessment that correlates gene expression level with physiologic parameters.

            produced strains that showed no obvious morphological defects in yeast vegetative growth or in ability to carry out polymorphic transitions from yeast cells to hyphae or to isotropic forms. However, assays showed that membranes of

            Δ strains were tested in a mouse model of acute infection,

            <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>babA</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>babB</jats:italic>

            and
            <jats:italic>babB</jats:italic>
            are independent of one another and that, for both, geographic variation is present. Analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in these regions showed that
            <jats:italic>babA</jats:italic>
            is more diverse, implying an earlier origin than that of the same region of

            , but that the
            <jats:italic>babA</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>babB</jats:italic>
            showing low mean compatibility scores and homoplasy ratios of 0.71 and 0.67, respectively, recombination is not sufficient to obscure evidence of clonal descent. Despite the involvement of
            <jats:italic>babA</jats:italic>
            in binding to the host blood group antigen Lewis B, neither the presence of different

VL patients' sera showed anti-papLe22 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG reactivities, indicating that a primary response against the leishmanial protein papLe22 accompanied acute VL manifestations. Specific IgG levels were correlated with patients' clinical status. The presence of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses suggested a mixed Th1- and Th2-type response; there was no correlation between subclass reactivity and the disease course. The recombinant papLe22 specifically activated interleukin-10 production by VL patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at diagnosis and after treatment-induced cure, indicating its contribution to VL pathogenesis and concomitant immunosuppression and its potential role in the reactivation of latent parasites. As a dominant immunogen, papLe22 might be used as a vaccine component, provided that the vaccination protocol directs the response toward the Th1 pattern.

            (GBS) is an important pathogen of neonates, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. GBS isolates associated with human infection produce one of nine antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharides which are thought to play a key role in virulence. A comparison of GBS polysaccharide structures of all nine known GBS serotypes together with the predicted amino acid sequences of the proteins that direct their synthesis suggests that the evolution of serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides has proceeded through en bloc replacement of individual glycosyltransferase genes with DNA sequences that encode enzymes with new linkage specificities. We found striking heterogeneity in amino acid sequences of synthetic enzymes with very similar functions, an observation that supports horizontal gene transfer rather than stepwise mutagenesis as a mechanism for capsule variation. Eight of the nine serotypes appear to be closely related both structurally and genetically, whereas serotype VIII is more distantly related. This similarity in polysaccharide structure strongly suggests that the evolutionary pressure toward antigenic variation exerted by acquired immunity is counterbalanced by a survival advantage conferred by conserved structural motifs of the GBS polysaccharides.

            into one of the 12 major sublineages or subgroups. All strains could be correctly positioned on the canonical SNP (canSNP) phylogenetic tree, except the divergent Pasteur vaccine strain ATCC 4229. We detected the cooccurrence of three canSNP subgroups in France. The dominant B.Br.CNEVA sublineage was found to be prevalent in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Auvergne region, and the Saône-et-Loire department. Strains affiliated with the A.Br.008/009 subgroup were observed throughout most of the country. The minor A.Br.001/002 subgroup was restricted to northeastern France. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis using 24 markers further resolved French strains into 60 unique profiles and identified some regional patterns. Diversity found within the A.Br.008/009 and B.Br.CNEVA subgroups suggests that these represent old, ecologically established clades in France. Phylogenetic relationships with strains from other parts of the world are discussed.

            Sixty-three clinical isolates of charcoal-black-pigmented, gram-positive coryneform rods were received for identification by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and were provisionally designated CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 (FCG4). Forty-five of these were characterized by morphological, physiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, cellular fatty acids, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses. Nitrate reduction, cellular fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies segregated these strains into two groups: FCG4a (8 strains) and FCG4b (37 strains). The FCG4a strains, only one of which was from a female genitourinary source, produced cellular fatty acid and biochemical profiles similar to those observed with reference strains of
            <jats:italic>Rothia dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Rothia mucilaginosa</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium</jats:italic>
            species. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated species-level relatedness among six FCG4a tested strains and showed that they were a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of
            <jats:italic>R. dentocariosa</jats:italic>

            and

            , were shown by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to be related at the species level and unrelated to the type strain of
            <jats:italic>R. dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            ; therefore, the
            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>C. aurimucosum</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>C. nigricans</jats:italic>

            Since the publication of the complete genomic sequence of
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter jejuni</jats:italic>
            NCTC 11168 in February 2000, evidence has been compiling that suggests
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            strains exhibit high genomic diversity. In order to investigate this diversity, the unique genomic DNA sequences from a nonsequenced
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic>
            strain,
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176, were identified by comparison with
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            NCTC 11168 by using a shotgun DNA microarray approach. Up to 63 kb of new chromosomal DNA sequences unique to this pathogen were obtained. Eighty-six open reading frames were identified by the presence of uninterrupted coding regions encoding a minimum of 40 amino acids. In addition, this study shows that the whole-plasmid shotgun microarray approach is effective and provides a comprehensive coverage of DNA regions that differ between two closely related genomes. The two plasmids harbored by this
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic>
            strain, pTet and pVir, were also sequenced, with coverages of 2.5- and 2.9-fold, respectively, representing 72 and 92% of their complete nucleotide sequences. The unique chromosomal genes encode proteins involved in capsule and lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, restriction and modification systems, and respiratory metabolism. Several of these unique genes are likely associated with
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176 fitness and virulence. Interestingly, the comparison of
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176 unique genes with those of
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            ATCC 43431 revealed a single gene which encodes a probable TraG-like protein. The product of this gene might be associated with the mechanism of
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            invasion into epithelial cells. In conclusion, this study extends the repertoire of
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            genes and thus will permit the construction of a composite and more comprehensive microarray of

Global transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays revealed that a significant number of genes, including inflammatory genes, were regulated in an NF-κB- and/or PI(3)K-dependent manner, identifying the NF-κB and PI(3)K pathways as key cellular control points in the conversion of monocytes to an activated proinflammatory state following HCMV infection.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA,2008,NA

            genome includes the large family of
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes, whose functions are unknown. Because of precedents in other pathogens in which gene families showing high sequence variation are involved in antigenic variation, a similar role has been proposed for the
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes has not been examined. Here, we sequenced 27
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes in 94 clinical strains from five phylogenetic lineages of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</jats:named-content>
            complex (MTBC). We found that
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes were overall more diverse than the remainder of the MTBC genome, but individual members of the family varied widely in their nucleotide diversity and insertion/deletion (indel) content: some were more, and others were much less, diverse than the genome average. Individual
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes also differed in the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations, suggesting that different selection pressures act on individual
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes. Using bioinformatic methods, we tested whether sequence diversity in
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes might be selected by human T cell recognition, the major mechanism of adaptive immunity to MTBC. We found that the large majority of predicted human T cell epitopes were confined to the conserved PE domain and experimentally confirmed the antigenicity of this domain in tuberculosis patients. In contrast, despite being genetically diverse, the PGRS domains harbored few predicted T cell epitopes. These results indicate that human T cell recognition is not a significant force driving sequence diversity in
            <jats:italic>pe_pgrs</jats:italic>
            genes, which is consistent with the previously reported conservation of human T cell epitopes in the MTBC.

            Single-celled organisms have different strategies to sense and utilize nutrients in their ever-changing environments. The opportunistic fungal pathogen
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Candida albicans</jats:named-content>

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. albicans</jats:named-content>
            gained a competitive advantage over other microbes to become a successful commensal and opportunistic pathogen. Here, we report that

            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>

            cells normally enter the G

GlcNAc triggers the upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis genes, alterations of mitochondrial metabolism, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by rapid cell death via both apoptotic and necrotic mechanisms. Multiple pathways, including the conserved cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling and GlcNAc catabolic pathways, are involved in GICD. GlcNAc acts as a signaling molecule to regulate multiple cellular programs in a coordinated manner and therefore maximizes the efficiency of nutrient use. This adaptive behavior allows
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. albicans</jats:named-content>

            The ability to rapidly and appropriately respond to nutrients in the environment is crucial to free-living microorganisms. To maximize the use of available nutrients, microorganisms often use a limiting nutritional component as a signal to coordinate multiple biological processes. The human fungal pathogen

            , and approximately 10 to 20% of patients report persistent symptoms lasting months to years despite appropriate treatment with antibiotics. To gain insights into the molecular basis of acute Lyme disease and the ensuing development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted a longitudinal transcriptome study of 29 Lyme disease patients (and 13 matched controls) enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for up to 6 months. The differential gene expression signature of Lyme disease following the acute phase of infection persisted for at least 3 weeks and had fewer than 44% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common with other infectious or noninfectious syndromes. Early Lyme disease prior to antibiotic therapy was characterized by marked upregulation of Toll-like receptor signaling but lack of activation of the inflammatory T-cell apoptotic and B-cell developmental pathways seen in other acute infectious syndromes. Six months after completion of therapy, Lyme disease patients were found to have 31 to 60% of their pathways in common with three different immune-mediated chronic diseases. No differential gene expression signature was observed between Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent symptoms at 6 months post-treatment. The identification of a sustained differential gene expression signature in Lyme disease suggests that a panel of selected human host-based biomarkers may address the need for sensitive clinical diagnostics during the “window period” of infection prior to the appearance of a detectable antibody response and may also inform the development of new therapeutic targets.

            Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States, and some patients report lingering symptoms lasting months to years despite antibiotic treatment. To better understand the role of the human host response in acute Lyme disease and the development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted the first longitudinal gene expression (transcriptome) study of patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed up for up to 6 months after treatment. Importantly, we found that the gene expression signature of early Lyme disease is distinct from that of other acute infectious diseases and persists for at least 3 weeks following infection. This study also uncovered multiple previously undescribed pathways and genes that may be useful in the future as human host biomarkers for diagnosis and that constitute potential targets for the development of new therapies.

            to understand the genetic diversity between closely related strains. Comparison of genomic sequences revealed that closely related strains were separated into three groups based on single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed throughout the genome. A large genomic deletion was detected in the region containing a bacitracin resistance gene cluster flanked by rRNA operons, resulting in the loss of bacitracin resistance. The structure of the deleted region, which was also conserved among species of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cereus</jats:named-content>
            group, has the potential for both deletion and amplification and thus might be enabling the species to flexibly control the level of bacitracin resistance for adaptive evolution.

            Thermal interventions are commonly used in the food industry as a means of mitigating pathogen contamination in food products. Concern over heat-resistant food contaminants has recently increased, with the identification of a conserved locus shown to confer heat resistance in disparate lineages of Gram-negative bacteria. Complete sequence analysis of a historical isolate of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Salmonella enterica</jats:named-content>
            serovar Senftenberg, used in numerous studies because of its novel heat resistance, revealed that this important strain possesses two distinct copies of this conserved thermotolerance locus, residing on a multireplicon IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid. Phylogenetic analysis of these loci in comparison with homologs identified in various bacterial genera provides an opportunity to examine the evolution and distribution of loci conferring resistance to environmental stressors, such as heat and desiccation.

            Zinc is crucial for many biological processes, as it is an essential cofactor of enzymes and a structural component of regulatory and DNA binding proteins. Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export.

This regulator was indeed found to be critical for establishment of infection in mice, likely involving its requirement for motility and biofilm formation.

By using N-terminal sequence and an internal protein sequence, a digoxigenin-labeled probe was made for nonradioactive hybridization, and a 2.5-kb gene fragment was obtained by colony hybridization of a cosmid library. Through Southern blotting and sequence analysis of the selected cosmid clone, the structural gene of the enzyme (1,335 bp) was identified, which encodes a protein of 47,244 Da with a theoretical pI of 6.2.

The enantioselectivity of the enzyme suggested that the recognition mode of Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids in the active site is reversed relative to that of Œ±-amino acids. After comparison of its primary structure with transaminase subgroup II enzymes, it was proposed that R43 interacts with the carboxylate group of the Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids and the carboxylate group on the side chain of dicarboxylic Œ±-keto acids such as Œ±-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate. R404 is another conserved residue, which interacts with the Œ±-carboxylate group of the Œ±-amino acids and Œ±-keto acids. The Œ≤-transaminase was used for the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically pure Œ≤-aminocarboxylic acids. (3

Eight ruminally cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 by 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments containing HQH, with either 0% concentrate/100% HQH (100HQH), 25% concentrate/75% HQH (75HQH), or 40% concentrate/60% HQH (60HQH). The fourth group (control [CON]) was fed 60% normal fiber-rich hay and 40% concentrate. The data showed that measures of diversity for the rumen epimural population, specifically the Shannon (

The expression of genes targeting intracellular pH regulation, barrier function, and nutrient uptake of rumen epithelium remained stable regardless of the carbohydrate source. In conclusion, the data suggest strong alterations of the ruminal epimural microbiota in response to changes in the nutritive patterns of the diet. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of these significant microbial changes on rumen health and food safety aspects in cattle at a transcriptional level.

            Feeding of forages versus starchy concentrates is a highly debated topic. Hay is believed to be healthier and more ecological sustainable for cattle than are concentrates, although the effects of feeding hay with enhanced sugar and protein content on epimural microbiota and host gene expression have not yet been evaluated. This research provides a report of the role of feeding hay with increased sugar and protein content in place of starchy concentrates in altering epimural microbiota and in generating a host response. Our research shows that the addition of high-quality hay to dairy rations shifted nutrient intake, resulting in strong alterations in the epimural microbiota in cattle. This work provides a background for further long-term research regarding the effects of feeding practices on the host-microbiome interaction and its role in rumen health and food safety in cattle.

            Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness and is endemic in 52 countries. There is a critical need to further our understanding of the host response during disease and infection, as millions of individuals are still at risk of developing blinding sequelae. Infection of the conjunctival epithelial cells by the causative bacterium,
            <jats:italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</jats:italic>
            , stimulates an acute host response. The main clinical feature is a follicular conjunctivitis that is incompletely defined at the tissue-specific gene expression and molecular levels. To explore the features of disease and the response to infection, we measured host gene expression in conjunctival samples from Gambian children with active trachoma and healthy controls. Genome-wide expression and transcription network analysis identified signatures characteristic of the expected infiltrating immune cell populations, such as neutrophils and T/B lymphocytes. The expression signatures were also significantly enriched for genes in pathways which regulate NK cell activation and cytotoxicity, antigen processing and presentation, chemokines, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. The data suggest that in addition to polymorph and adaptive cellular responses, NK cells may contribute to a significant component of the conjunctival inflammatory response to chlamydial infection.

            serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, and Sendai are human-adapted pathogens that cause typhoid (enteric) fever. The acute prevalence in some global regions and the disease severity of typhoidal
            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>
            have necessitated the development of rapid and specific detection tests. Most of the methodologies currently used to detect serovar Typhi do not identify serovars Paratyphi A or Sendai. To assist in this aim, comparative sequence analyses were performed at the loci of core bacterial genetic determinants and

These determinants provided phylogenetic data on the genetic relatedness of serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, and Sendai; and the protocols developed might allow the rapid identification of these
