          <jats:p>
            The inclusion of high-quality hay (HQH), in place of concentrates, shifts dietary carbohydrate intake, and the extent to which these shifts effect epimural microbiota and epithelial gene expression of the rumen has not yet been evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 by 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments containing HQH, with either 0% concentrate/100% HQH (100HQH), 25% concentrate/75% HQH (75HQH), or 40% concentrate/60% HQH (60HQH). The fourth group (control [CON]) was fed 60% normal fiber-rich hay and 40% concentrate. The data showed that measures of diversity for the rumen epimural population, specifically the Shannon (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.004) and Simpson (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.003) indices, decreased with increasing levels of HQH in the diet. The feeding of HQH shifted the epimural population from predominantly
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Firmicutes</jats:named-content>
            to
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Proteobacteria</jats:named-content>
            . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HQH feeding markedly shifted the abundance of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Campylobacter</jats:named-content>
            spp. from 7.8 up to 33.5% (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.001), with greater ingestion of protein (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.63) and sugars (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.65) in HQH diet being responsible for this shift. The expression of genes targeting intracellular pH regulation, barrier function, and nutrient uptake of rumen epithelium remained stable regardless of the carbohydrate source. In conclusion, the data suggest strong alterations of the ruminal epimural microbiota in response to changes in the nutritive patterns of the diet. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of these significant microbial changes on rumen health and food safety aspects in cattle at a transcriptional level.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Feeding of forages versus starchy concentrates is a highly debated topic. Hay is believed to be healthier and more ecological sustainable for cattle than are concentrates, although the effects of feeding hay with enhanced sugar and protein content on epimural microbiota and host gene expression have not yet been evaluated. This research provides a report of the role of feeding hay with increased sugar and protein content in place of starchy concentrates in altering epimural microbiota and in generating a host response. Our research shows that the addition of high-quality hay to dairy rations shifted nutrient intake, resulting in strong alterations in the epimural microbiota in cattle. This work provides a background for further long-term research regarding the effects of feeding practices on the host-microbiome interaction and its role in rumen health and food safety in cattle.

The postharvest supply chain with microbial travelers (PSCMT) model, presented here, provides a unique tool for postharvest supply chain simulations to evaluate microbial contamination. The tool was validated through modeling an observed tomato supply chain. Visualization of dynamic contamination levels from harvest to the supermarket and analysis of the model parameters highlighted critical points where intervention may prevent microbial levels sufficient to cause foodborne illness.

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. difficile</jats:named-content>
            ribotype 027 isolates as the basis for comparison of two capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based ribotyping methods. There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three different primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method. Similar differences between SCGE and QCGE were found on testing of 14 isolates of four other

Due to the large number of publications produced in bioinformatics, which nearly matches the number published in biochemistry, it can be inferred that bioinformatics is almost equal in significance to biochemistry.

            <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>
            ADE2. This edit leads to the buildup of an adenine precursor that dyes the edited cells red. As the repair template, guide RNA, and Cas9 are all encoded in our vector, transformation can be performed in 2 hours. Furthermore, since all components of the Cas9/CRISPR system are encoded by the vector, specialized equipment and reagents, such as a PCR machine or oligonucleotides, are not required to perform the experiments as designed. As such, these exercises provide an efficient cost-effective introduction to a wide variety of key molecular biology concepts and lay the foundation for more rigorous investigations in upper-level classes and independent research projects.

We also demonstrated that fat-soluble vitamins prevent antibiotic capture by binding bacterial lipocalin with higher affinity than antibiotics. Therefore, bacterial lipocalins contribute to antimicrobial resistance by capturing diverse antibiotics in the extracellular space at the site of infection, which can be counteracted by known vitamins.

            Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focuses on targeting essential functions within bacterial cells. We discovered a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operating in the extracellular space, which depends on bacterial protein molecules called lipocalins. These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells. We also discovered that liposoluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, overcome

Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export.
