Since studying foodborne pathogens in the environment is a complex and costly endeavor, computer simulation models can help to understand and visualize microorganism behavior resulting from supply chain activities. The postharvest supply chain with microbial travelers (PSCMT) model, presented here, provides a unique tool for postharvest supply chain simulations to evaluate microbial contamination. The tool was validated through modeling an observed tomato supply chain. Visualization of dynamic contamination levels from harvest to the supermarket and analysis of the model parameters highlighted critical points where intervention may prevent microbial levels sufficient to cause foodborne illness. The PSCMT model framework and simulation results support ongoing postharvest research and interventions to improve understanding and control of fresh produce contamination.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA,2018,NA

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            genotyping method, but its utility is limited by lack of standardization. In this study, we analyzed four published whole genomes and tested an international collection of 21 well-characterized
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. difficile</jats:named-content>
            ribotype 027 isolates as the basis for comparison of two capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based ribotyping methods. There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three different primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method. Similar differences between SCGE and QCGE were found on testing of 14 isolates of four other
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. difficile</jats:named-content>
            ribotypes. Based on our results, ISR profiles based on accurate sequencer-based band lengths would be preferable to agarose gel-based banding patterns for the assignment of ribotypes.

Modern technologies such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing offer a rapid species level identification when compared to conventional phenotype-based methods, however they rely on a well-established taxonomy database and phenotypic assays can still play an important role in species determination. Another major limitation is the up-front cost of purchasing these modern specialized instruments and the requirement of skilled personnel to operate specialized equipment and software, which makes them unsuitable to use in the undergraduate teaching laboratory. Commercial biochemical identification systems such as the Oxoid Microbact™ GNB 12A/12E/24E kit is used for the identification of Enterobacteriaceae and other Gram negative bacteria in clinical and veterinary diagnostic laboratories, and food industries for disease control and treatment. In this article, we describe a method of reliably simulating this Microbact™ strip assay using artificial color liquids (which are affordable and easy to source) for the demonstration of phenotypic characterization of unknown Gram negative organisms while providing a safe teaching environment as no bacteria are used, familiarizing students with the concept of using Microbact™ 12A kit to identify a range of unknown Gram negative organisms.</jats:p>",en,J Microbiol Biol Educ.,NA,2018,NA

Many papers have suggested the importance of adding these subjects, particularly bioinformatics, to an undergraduate curriculum; however, most of their assertions have relied on qualitative arguments. In this paper, we will show our metadata analysis of a scientific literature database (PubMed) that quantitatively describes the importance of the subjects of bioinformatics, systems biology, and biophysics as compared with a well-established interdisciplinary subject, biochemistry. Specifically, we found that the development of each subject assessed by its publication volume was well described by a set of simple nonlinear equations, allowing us to characterize them quantitatively. Bioinformatics, which had the highest ratio of publications produced, was predicted to grow between 77% and 93% by 2025 according to the model. Due to the large number of publications produced in bioinformatics, which nearly matches the number published in biochemistry, it can be inferred that bioinformatics is almost equal in significance to biochemistry. Based on our analysis, we suggest that bioinformatics be added to the standard biology undergraduate curriculum. Adding this course to an undergraduate curriculum will better prepare students for future research in biology.</jats:p>",en,J Microbiol Biol Educ.,NA,2015,NA

          <jats:p>
            The potential for microbes to overcome antibiotics of different classes before they reach bacterial cells is largely unexplored. Here we show that a soluble bacterial lipocalin produced by
            <jats:italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</jats:italic>
            upon exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations increases resistance to diverse antibiotics
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . These phenotypes were recapitulated by heterologous expression in
            <jats:italic>B. cenocepacia</jats:italic>
            of lipocalin genes from
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
            ,
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            , and methicillin-resistant
            <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
            . Purified lipocalin bound different classes of bactericidal antibiotics and contributed to bacterial survival
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Experimental and X-ray crystal structure-guided computational studies revealed that lipocalins counteract antibiotic action by capturing antibiotics in the extracellular space. We also demonstrated that fat-soluble vitamins prevent antibiotic capture by binding bacterial lipocalin with higher affinity than antibiotics. Therefore, bacterial lipocalins contribute to antimicrobial resistance by capturing diverse antibiotics in the extracellular space at the site of infection, which can be counteracted by known vitamins.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focuses on targeting essential functions within bacterial cells. We discovered a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operating in the extracellular space, which depends on bacterial protein molecules called lipocalins. These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells. We also discovered that liposoluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, overcome
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial lipocalins, providing an unexpected new alternative to combat resistance by using this vitamin or its derivatives as antibiotic adjuvants.

Previous studies in piglets demonstrated that MF alters the gut microbiome and induces inflammatory cytokine production. The links between MF feeding, gut microbiome, and inflammation status are unclear due to challenges associated with the collection of intestinal samples from human infants. The current report provides the first insight into MF-microbiome-inflammation connections in the small intestine compared with HM feeding using a porcine model.

            It is now relatively easy to obtain a high-quality draft genome sequence of a bacterium, but bioinformatic analysis requires organization and optimization of multiple open source software tools. We present Bactopia, a pipeline for bacterial genome analysis, as an option for processing bacterial genome data. Bactopia also automates downloading of data from multiple public sources and species-specific customization. Because the pipeline is written in the Nextflow language, analyses can be scaled from individual genomes on a local computer to thousands of genomes using cloud resources. As a usage example, we processed 1,664

For a comprehensive view, we use a joint evaluation of temporal dynamics in assembly mechanisms and community structure for both bacterial taxa and their functional genes at different abundance levels, in both disturbed and undisturbed states. We further reverted the disturbance state to contrast recovery of function with community structure.

            The inclusion of high-quality hay (HQH), in place of concentrates, shifts dietary carbohydrate intake, and the extent to which these shifts effect epimural microbiota and epithelial gene expression of the rumen has not yet been evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 by 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments containing HQH, with either 0% concentrate/100% HQH (100HQH), 25% concentrate/75% HQH (75HQH), or 40% concentrate/60% HQH (60HQH). The fourth group (control [CON]) was fed 60% normal fiber-rich hay and 40% concentrate. The data showed that measures of diversity for the rumen epimural population, specifically the Shannon (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.004) and Simpson (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.003) indices, decreased with increasing levels of HQH in the diet. The feeding of HQH shifted the epimural population from predominantly
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Firmicutes</jats:named-content>
            to
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Proteobacteria</jats:named-content>
            . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HQH feeding markedly shifted the abundance of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Campylobacter</jats:named-content>
            spp. from 7.8 up to 33.5% (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.001), with greater ingestion of protein (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.63) and sugars (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.65) in HQH diet being responsible for this shift. The expression of genes targeting intracellular pH regulation, barrier function, and nutrient uptake of rumen epithelium remained stable regardless of the carbohydrate source. In conclusion, the data suggest strong alterations of the ruminal epimural microbiota in response to changes in the nutritive patterns of the diet. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of these significant microbial changes on rumen health and food safety aspects in cattle at a transcriptional level.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Feeding of forages versus starchy concentrates is a highly debated topic. Hay is believed to be healthier and more ecological sustainable for cattle than are concentrates, although the effects of feeding hay with enhanced sugar and protein content on epimural microbiota and host gene expression have not yet been evaluated. This research provides a report of the role of feeding hay with increased sugar and protein content in place of starchy concentrates in altering epimural microbiota and in generating a host response. Our research shows that the addition of high-quality hay to dairy rations shifted nutrient intake, resulting in strong alterations in the epimural microbiota in cattle. This work provides a background for further long-term research regarding the effects of feeding practices on the host-microbiome interaction and its role in rumen health and food safety in cattle.

            Central dogma, transformation, and genome editing are key biological concepts for which junior scientists must gain experience during training. Here we present an exercise that introduces these concepts in a single practical laboratory exercise. Our exercise utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to introduce a stop codon into
            <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>
            ADE2. This edit leads to the buildup of an adenine precursor that dyes the edited cells red. As the repair template, guide RNA, and Cas9 are all encoded in our vector, transformation can be performed in 2 hours. Furthermore, since all components of the Cas9/CRISPR system are encoded by the vector, specialized equipment and reagents, such as a PCR machine or oligonucleotides, are not required to perform the experiments as designed. As such, these exercises provide an efficient cost-effective introduction to a wide variety of key molecular biology concepts and lay the foundation for more rigorous investigations in upper-level classes and independent research projects.
