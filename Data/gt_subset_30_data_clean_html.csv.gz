friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of open read frame from A friuliensis be sequence and analyze In addition to gene for regulation selfresistance and transport the cluster contain gene encode peptide synthetase protein involve in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic and protein involve in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acid pipecolinic acid

protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene pip Furthermore we show the involvement of the dabA and dabB gene in the biosynthesis of diaminobutyric acid by gene inactivation and subsequent feed experiment In recent year the sequence of numerous gene cluster involve in the synthesis of many secondary metabolite have become available for comparison and exploitation The program manipulation of gene encode enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway offer promise for redesign exist antibiotic structure to create antibiotic with new activity and the ability to overcome bacterial resistance Therefore each newly analyze gene cluster represent a new tool for combinatorial biosynthesis and can provide information about the synthesis of unusual build block such as nonproteinogenic amino acid acyl residue and sugar moiety a interest group of secondary metabolite for such experiment seem to be bioactive lipopeptides isolate from streptomycetes So far only a few biosynthetic gene cluster correspond to this lipopeptides have be isolate and characterize such as the cluster for calciumdependent antibiotic CDA from Streptomyces coelicolor daptomycin from Streptomyces roseosporus and A from Streptomyces fradiae By target modification and gene exchange it be possible to generate new lipopeptide structure Another member of this group of secondary metabolite be the antibiotic friulimicin that be produce by the actinomycete Actinoplanes friuliensis This compound be highly active against multidrugresistant grampositive bacterium such as methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus strain The biosynthesis of this lipopeptide be catalyze by nonribosomal peptide synthetase NRPS The eight bioactive lipopeptides isolate from A friuliensis consist of amino acid that form a ring structure with one exocyclic amino acid link to a acyl residue of various chain length The acyl residue be a branchedchain fatty acid with a Îcis double bond The structure of four of this lipopeptides be identical to that of know peptide antibiotic of the amphomycin group and possess aspartic acid at the exocyclic position The other four lipopeptides have asparagine at this position and be know as friulimicins A to have The peptide component of this friulimicins be characterize by unusual amino acid such as lthreo and derythrodiaminobutyric acid dpipecolinic acid and

repressionNucleotide sequence accession numb The nucleotide sequence datum report here be deposit in the EMBL datum library under accession no AJRESULTS AND DISCUSSION Organization of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster Heinzelmann and coworker previously identify a kb DNA fragment of the A friuliensis friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster locate on cosmid be The miss upstream section of the gene cluster be identify by far sequence analysis of this cosmid In order to complete the sequence of the friulimicin gene cluster downstream of the ORFs contain on be a cosmid library for A friuliensis be screen with a probe derive from the right end of the DNA insert of cosmid be Large overlap and miss part on cosmid E be identify repeat screen use a probe derive from the end of the DNA insert of the newly isolate cosmid lead to the identification of cosmid P The assembly of the sequence of the three overlap cosmid insert result in a stretch of approximately kb The putative ORFs and genetic organization of this chromosomal region be depict in Fig We identify putative promoter in intergenic region with suitable size or with a change in the direction of transcription We also propose the function of protein encode by the detectable ORFs base on significant similarity of the deduce amino acid sequence to sequence of know protein or conserve domain Relevant feature of the ORFs be summarize in Table Determination of the gene cluster boundary We can not clearly identify the boundary of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster base on the deduce function of the gene product Table The regulatory gene regA and regD have already be show to be a part of the gene cluster by use gene inactivation experiment to be publish elsewhere To determine whether orfOâ² and orfAP locate upstream of regA and orfP and orfTD locate downstream of regD Fig represent friulimicin biosynthetic gene the correspond gene be inactivate by gene disruption orfOâ² and orfAP and gene replacement orfP and orfTD use plasmid pCMFpCMF and pCMOPApra pCMTDApra respectively see material and method The genotype of the generate mutant be prove by Southern hybridization datum not show and analyze in a bioassay see material and method Inactivation of any of this gene have no effect on friulimicin biosynthesis datum not show and therefore this gene be not involve It be reasonable to assume that regA and regD represent the leave and right end of the cluster With this assumption a total of ORFs define the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster cover approximately kbNRPS Four gene of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster encode the nonribosomal peptide synthetase PstA to PstD Similarity to PstB and PstD be find in the daptomycin producer Streptomyces filamentosus Table The domain organization be analyze in silico use the highly conserve core motif of NRPS for a review see reference accord to the peptide structure of friulimicin adenylating domain be find one in PstA two in PstB six in PstC and two in PstD The gene encode the monomodular synthetase PstA be separate from the other NRPS gene by a set of nine gene involve in transport and regulation the synthesis of methylaspartic acid and the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component The Nterminal region of PstA approximately amino acid show no sequence similarity to any NRPS or polyketide synthase domain with know function Epimerization domain be locate at the end of PstB and PstC in the module and in accordance with the have configuration of pipecolinic acid and the Dab amino acid residue This result be consistent with the publish stereochemical structure of the friulimicin and amphomycin peptide PstD end with a thioesterase domain for regiospecific cyclization The friulimicin branch lactam ring be build from the C terminus of proline and the amino side chain of Dab The thioesterase domain may be a useful tool for the chemoenzymatic generation of other lipopeptide derivative Such a approach have be use for the synthesis of daptomycin derivative with the recombinant cyclization domain of the Streptomyces coelicolor CDA NRPS The synthesis of nonproteinogenic amino acid The peptide core of friulimicin include methylaspartic acid which be provide by a glutamate mutase complex encode by gene glmA and glmB and the nonproteinogenic amino acid pipecolinic acid at position and diaminobutyric acid at position and Fig The deduce amino acid sequence of the pip gene product Pip amino acid show high similarity to the sequence of lysine and ornithine cyclodeaminases the former be think to be responsible for the synthesis of pipecolinic acid rapL in the rapamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces hygroscopicus encode a protein with sequence identity to Pip RapL have high sequence similarity to a ornithine cyclodeaminase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and its involvement in the synthesis of pipecolinic acid be show by Khaw et al and Gatto et al It catalyze the deaminative cyclization of lysine to pipecolinic acid therefore the enzyme be consider to be a lysine cyclodeaminase To determine whether pip be involve in friulimicin biosynthesis we inactivate the gene by replace a internal bp NcoIXhoI fragment with a apramycin resistance cassette result in the mutant AFPIP The genotype of the mutant be confirm by Southern hybridization datum not show The mutant do not produce friulimicin as indicate by the loss of antibiotic activity in the bioassay datum not show This phenotype be attribute to the loss of pip gene function by successful genetic complementation and the subsequent restoration of friulimicin production see material and method Mutant AFPIP have friulimicin activity when grow on be medium supplement with racemic pipecolinic acid whereas other nonproducing mutant eg AFON and AFO see below do not have antibiotic activity when grow on this medium To verify pipecolinic acid production by Pip the pip gene on plasmid pRF under the control of the T promoter be heterologously express in E coli BLDEpLys see material and method Soluble Nterminally Histagged Pip be produce as show by purification use metal chelate affinity chromatography with Ninitrilotriacetic acid resin under native condition and subsequent Western blot analysis use the antibody epitope Xpress epitope in the recombinant protein for visualization Fig A To show the in vivo production of pipecolinic acid cell pellet of the expression strain E coli BLDEpLyspRF and of E coli BLDEpLyspRSETB be extract twice with ethanol and the correspond ethanolsoluble fraction be analyze by HPLC and TLC and compare The HPLC profile of the E coli BLDEpLyspRF extract reveal a new peak at about min no such peak be observe for the negative control E coli BLDEpLyspRSETB Fig C The mass spectrometry spectrum of the new peak reveal the expect molecular mass of pipecolinic acid Fig have The result be confirm by coinjection with pipecolinic acid as the internal standard With the detection of lpipecolinic acid in the ethanolsoluble fraction of the expression strain the in vivo activity of the Histagged lysine cyclodeaminase equivalent in a heterologous host be demonstrate The chiral specificity of the heterologously produce enzyme in E coli BLDEpLys be determine by chiralplate TLC and densitometric analysis Only lpipecolinic acid be find within the ethanolsoluble fraction of the expression strain Fig B owe to the ability to introduce reverse turn into peptide pipecolinic acid and its derivative be frequently use as a structural moiety in a numb of synthetic pharmaceutical The incorporation of unusual amino acid such as pipecolinic acid also seem to increase the proteolytic stability of this compound The biological activity of a molecule be often dependent upon its absolute configuration Therefore it would be desirable to have access to nonracemic pipecolinic acid Pip seem to be a good candidate for the biotechnological production of lpipecolinic acid which can then be use as a build block for the synthesis of bioactive peptide To date the biosynthetic mechanism of diaminobutyric acid be unknown We attempt to elucidate the step in diaminobutyric acid synthesis by identify gene within the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster encode protein with similarity to enzyme of amino acid metabolism The ORFs designate dabA and dabB and dabC encode protein with similarity to cysteine synthase and to a fusion protein contain both a argininosuccinate lyase and a ligase domain respectively Table equivalent of this ORFs be present in the symbiosis island of Mesorhizobium loti a rhizobacterium that also contain small amount of diaminobutyric acid We inactivate dabA and dabB to test their involvement in diaminobutyric acid synthesis The dabA gene be subject to insertional mutagenesis use plasmid pCMOApraN This plasmid carry the apramycinermEp resistance cassette aprP in the middle of the dabA gene A dabB knockout mutant be construct by replace a bp NcoISacI fragment of the gene with the aprP cassette by use plasmid pCMOApra Since in silico datum suggest that the gene expB dabA dabB dabC pstA and orf be translationally couple they may together form a operon Therefore ermEp be introduce in the transcriptional direction of the inactivate gene in both mutant to lessen the polar effect on gene downstream of the inactivation site The genotype of the result apramycinresistant kanamycinsensitive mutant AFON and AFO be confirm by Southern hybridization Fig A to have In this experiment instead of a kb BamHI fragment characteristic of the wildtype DNA hybridize kb and kb BamHI fragment in the correspond dabA and dabB mutant respectively be detect Friulimicin production be abolish in both mutant Fig E which indicate that both gene be essential for friulimicin biosynthesis The mutant be genetically complement by the clone of a native bp StuIEcoIII fragment of cosmid be carry part of regA expB dabA dabB dabC and part of pstA downstream of ermEp and the integration of the clone fragment into the genome of the mutant via the Î¦C attachment site see material and method The complement mutant produce friulimicin Despite the fact that a unintended polar effect on dabC cannot absolutely be exclude the phenotype of mutant AFON and AFO seem to be the result of a correct mutagenesis event For feed experiment RRdiaminobutyric acid be synthesize accord to the procedure describe by Han et al The synthesis of the SR form fail for unknown reason RRDiaminobutyric acid be not able to restore antibiotic activity in the dabA and dabB knockout mutant Therefore we assume that SRdiaminobutyric acid be specifically activate by the A domain of the correspond peptide synthetase module The RR form at position be subsequently form by the epimerization domain of this module This be in accordance with the stereospecific incorporation of amino acid in the biosynthesis of other nonribosomal peptide eg that of gramicidin In this example a dleucine thioester intermediate at the lleucinebinding site completely inhibit peptide synthesis The configuration be probably control at the peptide bond formation step SRdiaminobutyric acid be obtain by the hydrolysis of pure friulimicin have and subsequent partial purification The dabA and dabB knockout mutant feed the watersoluble component of fraction N contain both SR and RRdiaminobutyric acid produce friulimicin as detect by the formation of a zone of growth inhibition in a bioassay Fig E whereas the mutant feed a mixture of the individual amino acid present in the friulimicin peptide core except for diaminobutyric acid do not synthesize the antibiotic datum not show As control mutant with other inactivate friulimicin biosynthesis gene eg lipD and pstA be feed friulimicin be not produce datum not show Therefore the complementation of mutant AFON and AFO can be attribute to diaminobutyric acid which provide evidence for the involvement of dabA and dabB in the synthesis of this nonproteinogenic amino acid The order of the enzyme reaction be analyze in cosynthesis experiment by grow pair of the various mutant parallel to each other on agar plate Antibiotic production by the nonproducing mutant arise from cross feed suggest that the biosynthetic intermediate can be secrete into the medium and take up by other mutant to produce friulimicin The dabB knockout mutant AFO restore antibiotic production to the dabA AFO and pip AFPip knockout mutant The dabA knockout mutant restore production only to the pip knockout mutant and not to the dabB knockout mutant this result indicate that the dabB mutant be block at a late step of the reaction than the dabA mutant regard the in silico datum and the experimental result for dabA and dabB one can conclude that DabA DabB and DabC be involve in the synthesis of diaminobutyric acid Since DabA have similarity to the pyridoxal phosphatedependent cysteine synthase a Î² replacement or elimination reaction may be engage For the synthesis mechanism of the structurally relate compound diaminopropionate in the viomycin biosynthetic pathway the role of the cysteine synthase VioB in Î²substituent replacement on Oacetylserine have be propose previously But the mechanism for diaminobutyric acid synthesis must still be investigatedRegulation transport resistance synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component At less four gene of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster show similarity to regulatory gene RegC and RegD probably represent a twocomponent response regulatory system RegA have similarity to the transcriptional activator of bialaphos biosynthesis BrpA from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and PrpA from Streptomyces viridochromogenes RegB be a SyrPlike protein and may be involve in a phosphorylation cascade expA and expB encode the two component of a ABC transporter The gene encode the two component of other ABC transporter in antibioticproducing actinomycetes lie next to each other The expA and expB gene of A friuliensis in contrast be separate by a numb of other ORFs and be transcribe in opposite direction The mem gene possibly encode a integral membrane protein that function in friulimicin transport Friulimicin probably inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis by the complex of the carrier undecaprenyl monophosphate in analogy to the mode of action of the structurally relate antibiotic amphomycin Since the target lie inside the cell antibiotic efflux may be a important mechanism of selfresistance We provide evidence for such a selfresistance mechanism involve expA which encode the transmembrane component of a ABC transporter The expA gene under the control of the constitutive promoter ermEp on plasmid pEMExpA be overexpress in the friulimicinsensitive strain Streptomyces lividans TK The MIC for Streptomyces lividans TK transform with the vector pEM as a control be to Î¼g mlâ In contrast the MIC for Streptomyces lividans TK transform with pEMExpA be to Î¼g mlâ The increase in friulimicin resistance owe to expA expression be observe even though the ATPbinding domain of the correspond ABC transporter be miss in the heterologous host This mean that ExpA must have nonspecifically interact with another ATPbinding domain produce by Streptomyces lividans The gene lipA lipB and lipD be likely to have a role in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of friulimicin The deduce product of lipA have similarity to acyl coenzyme A acylCoA ligase exhibit the conserve AMPbinding domain motif and therefore probably represent a acylAMP ligase lipD encode a acyl carrier protein equivalent of lipA and lipD be present in the gene cluster for the lipopeptide daptomycin In A biosynthesis this function be fuse by the fusion of the correspond gene in the cluster The involvement of the lipB gene product a acylCoA dehydrogenase in the formation of the Îcis double bond in the acyl residue have previously be show by insertional inactivation and heterologous expression of the gene lipE encode a protein belong to the Î±Î²hydrolase family which include acyltransferases and thioesterases Whether this enzyme be involve in a acyltransferase reaction as predict in the acylation model of friulimicin biosynthesis be not clear A thioesterase type II function for the regeneration of misprimed NRPS be also possible To date a acyltransferase involve in such a antibiotic biosynthetic pathway have be find only for teicoplanin biosynthesis in Actinoplanis teichomyceticus where it acylates the sugar moiety Acyltransferase gene have not be identify in other biosynthetic gene cluster especially that for lipopeptides such as CDA daptomycin and surfactin The product of orf putative kinase orf hypothetical protein and orf

BIAevaluation software BiacoreRESULTS cDNA analysis and molecular clone of the U gene We be interest in the bp ORF U because the deduce amino acid sequence of the original predict ORF U product have a high degree of similarity to the sequence of the chemokine receptor include GPCRs The Nterminal amino acid sequence of the original predict ORF U be short than that of HHV U The primer UKpnI and UBamHI be design to include a methionine site in a small ORF upstream of the original predict U and the terminal site in the U gene respectively With this primer the U code region be amplify from cDNA that be synthesize with a oligodT primer from total RNA purify from HHVinfected cell Two band of and bp and of approximately equal intensity be obtain Fig A and this DNAs be insert into pCR The bp band be not observe in the gel contain total RNA purify from HHVinfected cell without reverse transcriptase RT treatment Fig A lane or in the gel contain DNA purify from infect cell with RT treatment Fig A lane this result suggest that the virusinfected cell contain at less two species of mRNAs for U in approximately equal amount The nucleotide sequence datum from five clone for each band show that and bp band be amplify from unspliced RNA or genomic DNA and splice mRNA respectively From the position of consensus splice donor and acceptor site it appear that the short mRNA be generate from two exon after a nucleotide intron be splice out Fig A and We then analyze U expression by Northern blot analysis use total RNA prepare from HHVinfected or uninfected SupT cell As show in Fig B U be highly express in the infect cellsAmino acid sequence homology with human CCR The Nterminal extracellular domain of the U product contain a potential Nglycosylation site as do much know GPCRs All the extracellular domain of the U product contain four highly conserve cysteine residue that be essential to the structure of GPCRs The cDNA contain intron a feature of much chemokine receptor gene and its sequence be identical to the genomic sequence The resultant nucleotide of code region can be translate into a aminoacid polypeptide encode a GPCR homolog Fig Since as describe above there be counterpart of this gene in the HHV and human genome we compare the amino acid sequence with human chemokine receptor U also exhibit homology to multiple mammalian GPCRs the high be to EBICCR The deduce amino acid sequence show homology to human CCR Fig Sequence alignment of the U product with the EBICCR product suggest that HHV U contain seven transmembrane region four extracellular domain and four cytoplasmic domain Fig Expression of UGFP We use fluorescence microscopy to confirm the expression of UGFP in each experiment Fig A A schematic draw of the section plane be give in Fig B A UGFPtagged expression vector be utilize in this experiment because the U polyclonal antiserum be not very reactive in Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence assay The GFP vector pEGFPN alone be a control in this experiment GFP expression be localize to the cytoplasm Fig A panel a and b in the control and the UGFP product seem to be detect on the membrane give that fluorescence be detect as dot throughout the cell Fig B panel c and dSignaling through the U GPCR in response to ELCMIPÎ² To test whether the U product be capable of signal transduction intracellular Ca level be monitor by measure the relative fluorescence of indoloaded cell stimulate with ELCMIPÎ² RANTES I MIPÎ² and IL as describe previously Fig To confirm the positive signal by a specific ligand and receptor we use as positive control cell express CXCR CCR CCR and CCR which respond to IL MIPÎ² I and RANTES respectively Fig B Untransfected and pCEPtransfected K cell do not respond to any of the chemokine test datum not show K cell transfect with U respond to ELCMIPÎ² but not to the other cytokine Fig A Treatment with buff alone do not induce Ca flux in parental K cell or K cell transfect with CCR CCR CCR or CXCR datum not show Treatment of U gene transfectants with ELCMIPÎ² induce transient elevation of the intracellular Ca level with a effective concentration of about nM Fig bind of ELCMIPÎ² to U ELCMIPÎ²SEAPHis be secrete as a single major protein with a expect apparent molecular mass of kDa Fig A This fusion protein have a alkaline phosphatase activity for quantitative trace and a His tag in its COOH terminus for easy purification and for fix to the Biacore NTA sensor chip By use realtime biospecific interaction analysis BIAcore Uppsala Sweden we study the bind affinity of the U Fig B To test whether the U product function as a chemokine receptor we examine the bind activity of the U product with ELCMIPÎ² Fig B Stable K cell line express pCEP EBICCR or U be use for this assay The Utransfected K cell express specific bind site for ELCMIPÎ²SEAPHis whereas the pCEPtransfected K cell do not A typical profile of bind of ELCMIPÎ²SEAPHis to Utransfected cell be show in Fig B The K cell transfect with pCEP EBICCR and U bind with relatively equal affinity to SEAPHis Fig B Under the same experimental condition SEAPHis use here as a negative control do not show bind of U to ELCMIPÎ² Fig BDISCUSSION In this paper we report that the U gene of HHV encode a chemokine receptor that be express in HHV infect SupT cell and we characterize the U protein The U gene be a kb RNA and encode a protein of amino acid residue that have seven transmembrane domain and a highly conserve GPCR motif at the junction of the 3 transmembrane domain and 2 intracellular loop Fig and The Nterminal amino acid sequence of HHV U be amino acid short than that of HHV U Homology search show that the U sequence be identical to that of EBICCR Fig The U receptor be capable of transduce a chemokine signal from ELCMIPÎ² to the cytoplasm that result in a transient elevation of the intracellular Ca concentration with a effective concentration of nM Fig and Its signal transduction response be similar to that of EBICCR Fig U be notable in that of the purify chemokine test the U protein appear to interact only with ELCMIPÎ² ELCMIPÎ² show homology to other CC chemokine with to identity ELCMIPÎ² be constitutively express in various lymphoid tissue include the thymus lymph node appendix and spleen Collectively this result show that ELCMIPÎ² be a specific highaffinity biological ligand for U The present study strongly suggest that HHVinfected cell respond to ELCMIPÎ² via U The EBICCR gene be first report by Birkenbach et al as a lymphocytespecific GPCR induce by EpsteinBarr virus EBV infection EBICCR be specific for ELCMIPÎ² and secondary lymphoidtissue chemokine and act to moderate cell migration and proliferation Furthermore Hasegawa et al show that the EBICCR gene be induce not only by EBV but also by HHV and infection in CD T cell Because EBICCR be constitutively express in various lymphoid tissue and on activate T and B lymphocyte ELCMIPÎ² and EBICCR may play role not only in inflammatory and immunological response but also in normal lymphocyte recirculation and home much CC chemokine be potent attractant of monocyte and be know to act via share receptor gene for EBICCR and EBI designate EBVinduced gene and be isolate through their strong upregulation in EBVnegative Burkitts lymphoma cell upon infection with EBV Similarly BLR and BLR designate as Burkitts lymphoma virus receptor and be isolate through their induction by EBV infection BLR which be identical to EBICCR be far show to be induce by the EBVencoded transactivator EBNA BLR and EBICCR be much homologous to the chemokine receptor whereas EBI be much relate to the thrombin receptor Furthermore herpesvirus such as HCMV herpesvirus saimiri HHV HHV and HHVKaposis sarcomaassociated herpesvirus be all know to encode GPCRs that be homologous to chemokine receptor A chemokine receptor encode by HHV be find to be constitutively active and to stimulate the proliferation of transfect cell make it a candidate viral oncogene take together this result suggest that virally encode putative chemokine receptor play important role in the infection and life cycle of herpesvirus especially in vivo The role of ELCMIPÎ² and U in HHVinfected T cell be not know at present but they may have biological activity in infect cell such as promote growth protect cell from apoptosis andor direct migration into specific anatomical location in vivo The identification of ELCMIPÎ² as a specific ligand for U now enable us to examine the possible role of ELCMIPÎ² and U in the infection process and life cycle of HHV Such study may lead to new strategy to prevent herpesvirus infection far study explore the function of U in vivo may provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis and latency of HHV infection In summary this paper report the first characterization of HHV U as signal the GPCR This result be expect give the property of HHV U but this still represent the first description of this molecule The much interest result be the identification of the U ligand The significance of this result stem from the possibility that a signal receptor may good contribute to pathogenesis

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01966-21","In the struggle with antibiotic resistance we be lose There be now a serious threat of move into a postantibiotic world High level of resistance in term of both frequency and strength have evolve against all clinically approve antibiotic worldwide The usable life spin of new clinically approve antibiotic be typically little than a decade before resistance reach frequency so high as to require only guard usage However microbe have produce antibiotic for millennium without resistance become a existential issue If resistance be the inevitable consequence of antibiotic usage as have be the human experience why have it not become a issue for microbe as good especially since resistance gene be as prevalent in nature as the gene responsible for antibiotic production Here we ask how antibiotic can exist give the almost ubiquitous presence of resistance gene in the very microbe that have produce and use antibiotic since before human walk the planet We find that the context of both production and usage of antibiotic by microbe may be key to understand how resistance be manage over time with antibiotic synthesis and resistance exist in a pair relationship much like a cipher and key that impact microbial community assembly Finally we put forward the cohesive ecologically base âsecret societyâ hypothesis to explain the longevity of antibiotic in nature INTRODUCTION WHY DO antibiotic EXIST IN NATURE The majority of develop antibiotic owe their existence to microbe antibiotic likely have be part of the microbial world for million of year But from the time they be discover by human and put into clinical use we consistently see resistance evolve to high frequency in short period of time typically within a decade or so FigÂ Resistance be often to such a high degree in term of frequency and level that the antibiotic become effectively useless for chemotherapeutic purpose give this two very different outcome we must consider why antibiotic use have not lead to resistance in natural microbial usage as it so reliably have for human The fact that all human use of antibiotic have lead to antibiotic resistance imply that resistance may be inevitable This outcome be not surprise give the intense selection for resistance in antibioticladen environment But if resistance be inevitable why do resistance to all naturally occur antibiotic not evolve and eliminate the possibility of miracle drug long before the discovery of penicillin almost a century ago Do microbe just manage antibiotic good or be there something intrinsic about microbial use of this compound that sustain their applicability Why have resistance to even the old form of naturally occur antibiotic not reach fixation Surely enough time have elapse for this possibility to occur What do microbe and human do differently In short we need to ask ourselves why do antibiotic exist at all Here we review the current state of knowledge concern antibiotic use and effect in both natural and humancontrolled system to good understand the role of antibiotic in the ecology and evolution of microbe past and presentTHE ORIGIN OF antibiotic AND THE ANTIBIOTIC ORIGIN STORY The cornerstone of modern medicine be lay in the s when Paul Ehrlich work with in vivo stain develop the idea of pair stainlike compound capable of enter cell with toxin that can kill it Ehrlichâs work lead to the development of salvarsan the worldâs first antibacterial dye continue to be a focus in the new field of âchemiotherapyâ In Gerhard Domagk show that prontosil a red dye be effective against streptococcal infection make it the first sulfa drug Prontosil be also highly effective against puerperal fever much associate with death in woman follow childbirth Sulfa drug suffer from negative side effect and be use with limit success in the midtwentieth century particularly during World War II antibiotic Salvarsan and prontosil be the flagship drug of the first two class of antimicrobial chemotherapy But while bactericidal they be both synthetic and not naturally occur biomolecule The first true antibiotic penicillin be discover by Alexander Fleming in Flemingâs observation that a fungus Penicillium notatum inhibit the growth of staphylococcus on agar medium lead to the isolation and identification of what become know as penicillin Contrary to how we think of penicillin today medicine be not revolutionize overnight even though Fleming publish his finding immediately Rather Fleming find that cultivate the fungus be difficult and that purify penicillin be problematic As such what would late be call the miracle drug be not good know until the problem of production be take up by Ernst Boris Chain Howard Florey Norman Heatley and Edward Abraham The work of this chemist lead to the isolation and purification of penicillin along with technique to efficiently prepare solution that can then be administer to patient Another milestone in the development of penicillin occur when another fungal strain Penicillium chrysogenum which produce many time much penicillin than Flemingâs strain be isolate from moldy fruit by Mary Hunt at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Illinois Clinical use of penicillin begin in but the worldâs first true antibiotic be largely ineffective against many infectious disease because penicillin work only against Grampositive bacterium Treatment of Gramnegative bacterium would wait for the next major advancement in infectious disease control which come when streptomycin be discover in the lab of Selman Waksman at Rutgers University in RISE OF RESISTANCE The first antibiotic resistance describe in publish report be to penicillin in Streptomycin resistance be report in the first randomize control clinical trial for a drug in In fact resistance to all know antibiotic whether natural or synthetic follow quickly after clinical or industrial use of the drug FigÂ The typical response be to identify and develop new antibiotic to replace old class lead to what have be call the golden age of antibiotic in the s and s However the pipeline of new easily identify antibiotic be quickly exhaust review in reference lead to a lack of available treatment option by the s that continue today Some program such as the Ã â initiative have add newly approve antibiotic but this trend seem likely to be shortlived There be two major reason for the decline in new antibiotic over the past halfcentury great difficulty in identify new class of drug and the skyrocket cost of development The cost of bring a new drug to market be estimate to be over billion convert from dollar With such a investment require pharmaceutical company have little financial interest in develop lowprofit shorttreatmentduration medicine such as antibiotic Financial concern be far magnify give that the life expectancy of this new and expensive product have consistently be limit to little than a decade of clinical use due to antibioticresistant strain rise to high frequency within that time FigÂ In reaction to the antibiotic resistance problem and with treatment option dwindle public health official attempt to control antibiotic usage as a mean of control resistance The expectation be that rate of resistance would diminish as antibiotic usage drop However resistance persist even in the face of such drug management practice on both small and large scale â This fail approach for control the evolution of resistance by limit usage be aptly name âthe ecological fallacyâ This fallacy be base upon a simplify view of evolution in which fitness gain due to antibiotic resistance be offset by fitness cost to bearer of resistance phenotype due to reduce performance in other aspect of their biology ie tradeoff The flaw in this reason be the assumption that the absence of a antibiotic from the environment have the same level of impact as but opposite effect of its presence We have learn that reversion to sensitivity be neither a immediate nor necessary outcome of selection simply because a resistant pathogen be no long in a antibioticladen environment The reason for this relate to the last impact of antibiotic treatment upon microbe as good as change at the genetic level that reconfigure the fitness landscape for resistant population and make reversion little likely â In essence the presence of clinical concentration of antibiotic much strongly select for resistance than the absence of antibiotic select for reversion to antibiotic sensitivityTHE ENVIRONMENTAL RESISTOME microbe be among the old extant organism and during their billion of year of existence have come into close contact with toxic molecule of all type Microbial genomics have provide a wealth of datum indicate that much bacterial genome have gene that allow them to become resistant to one or much antibiotic this datum have lead to the development of the concept of a âantibiotic resistomeâ which include all antibiotic resistance gene ARGs and their precursor in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacterium Notably ARGs exist in all ecological niche that harbor microbial community this finding reinforce the essential role that antibiotic and other toxic substance have play in bacterial evolution and strongly suggest that resistance to antibiotic have coevolved along with antibiotic biosynthesis review in reference The metagenomic analysis of ancient DNA show clearly that antibiotic resistance be a natural mechanism that predate the use of antibiotic as therapeutic drug Soil bacterium play a essential role in the production of antibiotic and provide deep insight into the capacity to inactivate them For instance the genome of soil actinomycetes contain much than biosynthetic gene cluster for diverse bioactive compound and ARGs In addition there be soil bacterium that can use antibiotic as their sole carbon source A deep understand of the functional role of both antibiotic biosynthesis and ARGs in the environment can shed light onto how to address the future use of antibiotic to fight bacterial infectionsNATURAL RESISTANCE Retrospective investigation into the existence of resistance in the time before the introduction of penicillin the preantibiotic era Box indicate that ARGs be not only present but also common in a wide range of bacterial species particularly on plasmid While the numb of such preantibioticera study be limit we see that resistance to naturally occur antibiotic be common with much than one ARG exist for natural antibiotic such as penicillin The numb and diversity of ARGs in the preantibiotic era be much great than expect and plasmid carry this gene have long be horizontally transfer within and between species this datum suggest that antibiotic resistance have be in existence for as long as antibiotic themselves Why then do widespread antibiotic resistance never arise and sweep to fixation over the million of year of consistent use by microbe though it so reliably and irreversibly evolve in treatment for modern pathogen HOW be antibiotic use IN NATURE In nature antibiotic be employ in a very different way than they be in clinical treatment much glaringly antibiotic be not produce in such high concentration for such long duration or at such large scale In the clinic antibiotic be use to kill all susceptible bacterium any outside consequence of that use be ancillary As such the difference in the application of antibiotic between microbe and the clinic should be carefully consider as this difference suggest that their effect may also differCONCENTRATION DURATION AND SCALE Clinical use of antibiotic in human be center upon concentrate delivery of the compound over time This usage directly tie concentration and duration together in a fundamental way Clinically effective dose of antibiotic be identify use pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics PKPD Box dose of a antibiotic to cure a infectious disease be a determine function of the peak concentration of antibiotic a proxy of bacteriumkilling power and the efficacy of a deliver dose over time usually âh a proxy measure of chemical stamen in situ Put simply the measure ability of a single dose of a antibiotic to kill bacterium and persist at detectable concentration be optimize by PKPD for clinical use against a bacterial strain of specify susceptibility If lowlevel resistance be find in a strain high peak and residual concentration over the specify time be use PKPD curve must be determine for human and animal since biologically active host will metabolize and excrete the antibiotic This degradation reduce the total drug present over time with the entire host environment capable of metabolize the drug Contrast this with natural environment where antibiotic concentration will be much variable over time Clearly there will be no PKPDlike optimization and in a environment such as soil metabolic degradation will be much transient than would be the case in animal tissue As a result antibiotic in natural environment such as soil may linger for much long period of time than in clinical use Experimental datum support this conclusion show that antibiotic in soil water and even plant seem to persist over long period of time before they be degrade by biotic and abiotic reaction mostly by microbial population But the ability of microbe to degrade environmental antibiotic suggest that this process be heavily dependent upon the type and size of microbial community present as good as abiotic condition such as temperature moisture and pH give the reliance on such diverse and uncontrolled variable in the environment antibiotic degradation be decidedly slow and heterogeneous The much likely result be long antibiotic residence time in the environment Concentration however be a different issue There be no consistent datum on natural antibiotic concentration in the environment review in reference but concentration be reasonably suspect to be much low than that use in the clinic For a compound to be functional as a antibiotic ie either bactericidal or bacteriostatic concentration in nature must meet or exceed the MIC for the target speciesstrain Often the MIC can be extremely low âmgL or ângÎ¼L Such concentration should be achievable in naturally grow population although likely over only limit distance The result be that a single microbe can produce a small amount of a antimicrobial compound that raise the concentration to or above MICs in the microlitersized space around that particular cell As many cell within the population produce the antibiotic the concentration in the volumetric space around that population increase Nonetheless concentration of antibiotic in naturally occur population be not likely to approach even the same order of magnitude as in the clinic Consider streptomycin in patient with tuberculosis target serum concentration be often about âÎ¼gmL or Ã high than the measure MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Ã high than a MIC of âmgL This difference in concentration represent a drastic change in the magnitude of selection with all lowlevelresistant mutant be impact in the same way and to the same degree as completely sensitive wildtype clone The conclusion be that concentration of naturally occur antibiotic compound and their effect be order of magnitude low than that use in the clinic In addition the time in which antibiotic remain in natural environment be different than in human patient Pharmacodynamics not only optimize peak concentration but also set low limit below which serum concentration should not fall This low limit be often associate with the measure MIC for the pathogen Any time spend below this level be implicate in selection for resistance mutation such as in the mutant selection window hypothesis Therefore from a evolutionary perspective the way we use antibiotic be central to the current problem of antibiotic resistance and may be crucial to understand how microbe have be able to employ antibiotic over long period In the natural situation describe a concentration gradient exist in space with high concentration close to the source and low concentration far away FigÂ In the clinical picture the concentration gradient exist in time with value during treatment in a constant cyclical and control flux In addition antibiotic concentration be roughly the same everywhere within the host at any give time The important distinction between this two lie in the possible response a physical gradient can be tolerate through movement perhaps even small one In contrast a temporal flux particularly at the concentration consider become a existential condition necessarily impact the ability to survive and with it the strength and direction of selection Similarly it have be show that combination of antibiotic can enhance or diminish bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect suggest that clinicallevel concentration be not the only way of ensure populationlevel effect upon microbe This range of combinatorial effect add depth to the numb of possible outcome in a localize environment as synergistic effect of antibiotic can both low the probability of evolve resistance and expand the mutant selection window via antagonistic interaction The last of our immediate consideration be that of scale The limit concentration and unknown duration of antibiotic compound in natural environment contrast with the consistently high concentration call for by PKPD Additionally the impact of human use of antibiotic be global in all sense of the word Within patient antibiotic be distribute by design throughout the body Ease of infection site delivery have always be a key advantage of antibiotic patient be treat with antibiotic orally intravenously rectally or via injection with circulatory system facilitate transport to infect area This effortlessness be due in large part to the small size of antibiotic molecule and the fact that they have little crossreactivity with molecule outside the target species Contrast this with the complication of infection site delivery associate with other approach such as phage therapy The combination of the ease of delivery with the widespread use of broadspectrum antibiotic to treat large group of suspect but not necessarily identify pathogen result in the withinpatient ubiquity of antibiotic upon which we have come to rely On a large scale since antibiotic have become a omnipresent pollutant in environment of all type Even in place largely untouched by human we can find antibiotic compound and with them ARGs â In recent year we have learn that even low level of antibiotic pollution select for high level of resistance â Additionally regardless of the biome or their ability to clear pollutant humanityâs worldwide industriallevel use of antibiotic have result in a steady stream of antibiotic into the environment without ever allow natural system to return to baseline level The result of humanityâs overproduction and misuse of antibiotic include their massive presence in agriculture and animal husbandry â be the transformation of a natural product use in limit scope within microbial community into a biological weapon of mass destruction dispatch against microbial community of all type in all place This abuse be on the same scale as nuclear weapon test another misuse midtwentieth century technology Although the expect duration of antibiotic contamination be think to be significantly short than that of nuclear fallout the longterm impact upon microbial community and the genetic change necessarily impose by selection for resistance through contamination of the environment be beyond calculation Interestingly although the timeline of nuclear fallout and its impact be much long than that of antibiotic pollution in the environment antibiotic pollution have already last long in term of generation for microbe radionuclide result from test explosion such as plutonium halflife year degrade on a scale of approximately human generation Even if we require several halflives to have pass in order to accept a low nuclear pollution level that time be still dwarf by the numb of microbial generation that have pass since the industrial production of antibiotic start in signal If the concentration duration and scale of antibiotic use in nature be so vastly different from clinical use the question of what need antibiotic evolve to meet remain What be the role of antibiotic in natural environment Potential answer to this question be few but one hypothesis that have gain considerable support be that antibiotic function as a signal molecule in microbial environment â The observation that low concentration of antibiotic compound can act as transcriptional regulator have become integral to our understand of interspecific dynamic in natural microbial community The transcriptional change induce by antibiotic compound range widely from species to species and compound to compound however many of the gene upregulated be implicate in stress response or biofilmassociated phenotype suggest that the use of antibiotic in nature differ from their presume role as weapon of microbial warfare In fact we argue that this presumption cannot be correct Consider how antibiotic be disperse through space in a natural medium such as soil Microbial cell produce and excrete the antibiotic into the space around them The concentration be high at the source and drop with distance from the producer cell The result be a zone of inhibition the phenomenon Fleming first observe in A standardize paper disk or KirbyBauer test be base upon the principle that the outer circumference of the zone of inhibition be directly relate to the MIC for the bacterial strain test mean that at the outer edge the concentration of the antibiotic be test be high enough to stop growth However the diffusion of the antibiotic can reasonably be expect to continue past the outer ring of the inhibition zone disregard any metabolic inactivation and should continue to decrease over space potentially affect transcription in the bacterial cell present in this space Contrast this with the PKPD approach where the goal be to maintain high serum concentration in the entire volume over a specify time Hormesis and the totality of antibiotic effect upon microbial population be still not good understand combination of antibiotic can also shift the effect of antibiotic compound in a environment suggest that the low concentration find in nature may have oversized effect upon bacterial population base on the totality of compound present Such synergistic or antagonistic effect may also inform hypothesis as to why microbe produce and excrete both bacteriostatic and bactericidal compound as good as offer a hypothesis underlie observation of antagonism between this different type of compound particularly at microbial scale In addition the range of natural environment in animal host for microbe be large Consider for example the different environment possible for âgut microbiomesâ In each of that different bacterial community with specific functional requirement will coexist Furthermore the impact of antibiotic on such community and their residual influence on host health be vital to a complete understand of the effect of antibiotic and resistance in natural microbial environment Clearly the use of antibiotic in natural environment have much to teach us about how and why this compound have be in use for eon force us to reevaluate our assumption that the sole purpose of antibiotic lie in antagonismREINTERPRETING antibiotic WITH NATURE AS OUR ROSETTA STONE Clinical use of antibiotic be root in the assumption that species produce a particular antibiotic do so for the purpose of directly compete against other species or strain in the natural environment This presumption be the same as that which underlie antibiotic use by human antibiotic be armament of antagonism produce by one microbe and mean to hinder another Interestingly human depart from this supposition much than we adhere to it clinical therapeutics be not the large use of antibiotic and have not be for some time In the s it be observe that livestock much efficiently achieve market size when give low dose of antibiotic While hypothesis for this observation exist a complete explanation have not yet be decipher Nonetheless we continue to use much industrially produce antibiotic not for microbial antagonism per se but rather for fast animal growth without regard for the mode of action or its consequence give humanityâs incomplete and inconsistent consideration of antibiotic their application and their purpose a much complete analysis of their use under condition shape by evolutionary and ecological force be warrant particularly give the long success microbe have have use antibiotic and perhaps much importantly manage antibiotic resistance First and foremost we note that in nature synthesis of and resistance to antibiotic be intimately connect study of naturally occur resistance indicate that a ARG be often link with the gene involve in biosynthesis of that antibiotic This association be confirm in sample represent preantibioticera strain as good as that from pristine environment with many of the antibioticresistance pair encode in phylogenetically relate group The consistent pair of antibiotic production with ARGs within monophyletic group couple with such productionresistance pairing on mobile plasmid strongly suggest that this connection signal a longstanding fundamental characteristic of antibiotic use in nature Phylogenetic tie between strain and group be also support by ecological interaction between and within this group much often than expect by a null model microbial community be make up of phylogenetically relate interact species The hypothesis underlie this observation be that abiotic variable in the environment filter community member and much closely relate species be much likely to have similar niche We propose another possible hypothesis for this observation community assembly be govern by biotic or perhaps much properly antibiotic filter as much as abiotic filter This hypothesis explain the phylogenetic cluster observe in microbial community across a large array of environment as good as the consistency of grouping at the family taxonomic level observe in community Additionally the existence of such mutualism would also provide a explanation for the observation of antibiotic resistance arise as a emergent phenomenon within some community as a result of cooperative action rather than from the biochemical process within single cell As community grow distinct pairing that represent symbiotic interaction be often vital It be beneficial for a species present to filter the pool of possible neighbor with which they will interact so as to increase the likelihood that a beneficial partner will be present particularly when limit carbon resource be likely to be utilize by much than one member of the community By produce and secrete a give antibiotic into the space around the producerâs position a species may not be so much try to impair competitor as to reserve space for prove partner Experimental evidence of community construction base upon interaction in which antibiotic play a role have be observe neighbor thus select will need to be antibiotic resistant which may also be much probable if they be also phylogenetically relate to the producer In addition because of the pair of antibiotic production gene with ARGs the resistant neighbor be also much likely to be able to produce the same antibiotic compound thereby reinforce the screen effect and reserve even much space for the mutualistic pair to then grow into andor control Such a dynamic would indicate that resistance be precisely the mechanism that make antibiotic valuable in natural microbial community far multimember community action be implicate as combination of antibioticclasses present can enhance or antagonize the effect of a antibiotic overall lead to additional communitylevel filter capacity The implication that natural antibiotic production and resistance should be intimately tie together can be contrast with the presumption that antibiotic be a weapon of microbial warfare In the combat framework antibiotic production be beneficial with the ability to produce much be good akin to the PKPD approach This dynamic imply the strong potential for a evolutionary arm race However this system seem never to have dwell in the realm of the red queen hyperproducers on the scale of clinical concentration be not know nor be high level of resistance The strain of P chrysogenum that Mary Hunt isolate from a rot cantaloupe be a hyperproducer of penicillin but artificial selection and Xray mutagenesis experiment yield even higherproducing mutant suggest that such a mutational path be possible via one or a few mutational step but not likely to have ever be beneficial to fitness In addition investigation into the evolution and longterm application of antibiotic as weapon of microbial warfare suggest that the microbial armory be large and diverse but that evolutionary strategy that employ competition and antagonism ultimately need to be tightly control Control be ultimately both costly and complex particularly when eukaryote be also consider The cost of control mechanism along with their nearubiquity across microbial species suggest that a largescale evolutionary arm race be limit even though the numb and type of microbial âweaponsâ continue to diversify A slightly different approach and one that be in line with evolutionary game theory be that even limit cooperation can be little costly over the numb of interaction likely as good as over the evolutionary time scale involve Consider that clinically relevant antibiotic resistance of the kind common today be know to be costly to fitness overall make both side of this evolutionary war game lose strategy without a consistent and strong offset force Any breakdown of such a compensate tension would likely lead to antibiotic rapidly lose all potential benefit and be select against by natural selection follow by costly ARGs although this argument run dangerously close to replay the ecological fallacy pair this phenotype however create a balance approach that can be maintain via selection by the constant need for community assembly across many environment over vast evolutionary timescale Even strain that be not resistant to a particular antibiotic may be influence by low concentration of the compound through transcriptional change and gene regulation gene that be transcriptionally impact can possibly make the species much likely to cooperate with the antibiotic producer or alternatively little likely to invade the producerâs space edgespecialist bacterium Such supposition be amenable to experimental inquiry and offer one potential line of hypothesis test andor development This cooperative effect would presumably be great just beyond the outer edge of a zone of inhibition where concentration be low suggest a kind of secret âfriend or foeâ inquiry be put to a potential neighbor by the producer prior to any direct interaction Similar system be know to exist in quorum sense feedback in species such as Clostridioides formerly Clostridium difficile suggest that nonconstitutive phenotype can be induce base upon biointeractions with adjoin bacterial cell give the metabolic and fitness cost associate with antibiotic production it be not surprise that researcher be also find antibiotic synthesis link to quorum sense in cocultures particularly as a mechanism to limit social cheater suggest that a main outcome of this interaction be relate to community build and stability This âsecret societyâ hypothesis where know member be trust new member undergo hazinglike phenotype acquisition and potential newcomer be continuously recruit also provide a potential explanation for why ARGs in the clinic be often associate with plasmid Preantibioticera plasmid often maintain a producerresistance pair This may have be beneficial in increase the likelihood of a pair of successful community member become neighbor again in another community even if they be not phylogenetically relate The probability of a mutualistic association can be increase in the future by the share of a plasmid by a producer in essence a initiation ritual A recent study show increase probability of plasmid persistence with increase number of strain in a community A similar system exist in colicinogenic plasmid in certain strain of Escherichia coli where the colicin operon contain a colicinencoding gene cxa be bundle with the immunityencoding gene cxi or imX Plasmid transfer be also affect by antibiotic concentration with the makeup and structure of microbial community influence what the target recipient of plasmid may be suggest again that antibiotic have long be tie to the structure and makeup of microbial community If the secret society system be a dominant selective force in evolve and maintain antibiotic in the preantibiotic era then change in the magnitude frequency and diversity of antibiotic after would likely have cause a consequent shift away from a productionresistance balance in favor of a resistancedominated evolutionary strategy We observe just such a signal when we compare the level of resistance in preantibiotic era collection to modern circulate strain of bacterium We also observe such cooption of exist plasmid in the environment Such evidence compel us to consider the possibility that the propensity to donate a plasmid contain a productionresistance pair may have regularly be coopt by bacterium after the dawn of the antibiotic age drive by selection as a measure to survive clinical treatment with high concentration of industrially produce antibiotic compoundsGHOSTS OF RESISTOMES PAST One potential concern inherent in a secret society system be that past violation in which the pair be break would likely already have become fix within the relevant population This lead to consideration of what potential signature of the pair system may exist beyond that already mention The question of concern be whether break pairing in the past can have lead to fixation of ARGs which would in turn lead to the eventual loss of synthesis gene for that specific natural antibiotic If antibiotic be use in eon past not in a pair way but rather as a way to kill competitor as have long be the presumption then resistance to that antibiotic compound would be highly beneficial to fitness The frequency of resistance carrier would increase and become fix over time render the antibiotic useless The ability to synthesize the antibiotic would presumably be lose via selection over time How then can we put forward the secret society hypothesis without be able to know if such a simple series of event happen in the distant past One possible approach would be to look for echo of selection from long ago pairing compare to the natural antibiotic compound present today much precisely we can look at the halflife of natural antibiotic in their relevant environment to understand how quickly they naturally degrade and use that datum to inform a null hypothesis There be three likely scenario extant natural antibiotic can have a long halflife than other compound such as signal molecule they can have a short halflife or they can have one that be about the same as that of other synthesize extracellular compound Should natural antibiotic have a comparable halflife not much new information can be gain If they have a short halflife in the environment than similar extracellular molecule that would imply that natural antibiotic be incapable of build up in the natural environment render the likelihood of runaway selection for resistance low However if the halflife of natural antibiotic in the environment be long then selection for resistance to the accumulate concentration of this compound become much likely If this happen long ago we would have lose any signal because the resistance allele would have become fix perhaps before we even know of microbesâ existence Therefore we would expect that natural antibiotic have a short halflife than much other naturally produce extracellular compound since we can still find such a diversity of them produce in microbial community While not a definitive test such a approach provide for some baseline experimental inquiryCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE prospect To have any hope of counter the rise in antibioticresistant infection we will need to good understand the source impact and implication of the problem While concern over infection rate be a biomedical matter resistance be the result of evolutionary process Here we argue that as a precursor to develop effective mitigation strategy we need to expand consideration beyond either biomedicine or evolutionary biology and include the vast ecological dimension We begin by ask why antibiotic exist at all give that resistance to clinical drug have so reliably evolve shortly after the introduction of every new class of antibiotic over the past âyears antibiotic be not new they be old than the human species Yet within a single human lifetime many clinical antibiotic have be render ineffective Within another lifetime antibiotic resistance may become the scourge of our time To understand this sea change we look to the biological history of this secondary microbial metabolite for clue as to how their use may be preserve much profound among the difference between the historic use by nature of antibiotic and their current therapeutic purpose be the divorce of antibiotic use from any counterbalance resistance separate this ecologically conjoin twin and remove the context and countercontext put their trajectory on different and ultimately dangerous path The concentration duration and scale of human use create a potent artificial selection for antibiotic resistance to unnaturally high level and frequency Evolution to resistance under clinical antibiotic condition be quite literally a mandatory survival strategy for microbe datum collect over decade suggest that antibiotic production phenotype have largely be pair with complementary antibiotic resistance phenotype A similar pair be find in other microbial toxin system such as in colicins Natureâs signal in this regard seem clear produce a antibiotic be not very meaningful without also be resistant Horizontal gene transfer system particularly plasmid reinforce this conclusion but the numb and type of such plasmid suggest that antibiotic play a large role than just a weapon of war among microbe We suggest that this large role be one of mutualistic cooperation particularly important in establish and maintain microbial community Beneficial interaction in one community can become much likely in other community if the interactor be both present in the new community But we still do not understand all the way in which cooperative interaction begin Antibiotic use as describe here may offer additional insight into this area Novel beneficial interaction can be reinforce and even reciprocate through production of a antibiotic by one or both participant In addition the exchange of antibiotic production and resistance gene can cement a relationship for future interaction The importance of such mutualism may be intensify give the structure spatial makeup of microbial community such as in biofilm as good as the numb and type of producer present This pair of production and resistance level may have be the main mean of maintenance over million of generation Neither production amount nor resistance level experience directional selection pressure to increase or decrease since there would be significant fitness cost without any benefit gain In addition if a give cooperation be beneficial to the community that interaction would be select for under the condition experience In other word there would exist selection for a maintain balance between antibiotic production and resistance Of course the implication be that human break this microbial social contract by coopt antibiotic under the presumption that they be a underutilize tool and transform them into a biological weapon of mass destruction In do so we create a potent selection for high and high resistance level lose the ability to control or manipulate it be inevitable if not foresee We have put forward the hypothesis that antibiotic resistance be not a evolutionary reaction to antibiotic warfare but rather a cocomponent of a prefer assembly mechanism for microbial community This hypothesis can be investigate experimentally Such a series of experiment would continue to shine light not only on the mechanism and role of antibiotic in natural system in the preantibiotic era but also on their importance in a ecological context Finally by understand how the pair of antibiotic production with resistance can achieve and maintain a balance we will have develop the potential for mitigation strategy that may impact human health for lifetime to comeACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Davida Smyth and Antun Skanata for many helpful discussion

inhibitor have contribute significantly to the effective treatment of infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus HCV coronavirus have two protease the main protease CLpro or Mpro and the papainlike

of CLpro present a distinct glutamine at the P site LeuGlnSer Ala Gly while no know human protease recognize this cleavage site CLpro can thus be consider a highly attractive drug target for the

chemistry investigation be use to rationalize the phenotype observe for ALG in vitro PF and the associate crystal structure XHM provide a convenient start point for model ALG in the catalytic pocket of CLpro due to the structural similarity between the two compound In particular both structure feature a hydroxymethylketone warhead that bind covalently to Cys as good as a methoxyindoleP substituent Multiple conformation of ALG be use as input for dock calculation this yield a wellconverged predict bind mode of ALG covalently bind to the catalytic site of WT CLpro FigÂ A In line with the crystal structure disclose for similar compound eg XHM ALG be predict to form a covalent bond from the activate carbon atom of its hydroxymethylketone warhead to the side chain of the catalytic C residue anchor the inhibitor into the bind cleave of CLpro ALG form seven direct hydrogen bond with the SARS CoV CLpro catalytic site FigÂ B The oxygen atom of the inhibitorâs warhead interact with the backbone NH of C in the oxyanion hole The carbonyl oxygen of the P lactam hydrogenbonds to the side chain of H while the NH of the P lactam be involve in a bifurcate interaction with the side chain of E and the backbone carbonyl of F The peptide backbone of ALG anchor itself with hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of H and the backbone HN of E The NH function of the P indole hydrogenbonds the inhibitor to the backbone carbonyl of E The fuse bicyclic P substituent of ALG maximize Van der Waals interaction via extensive productive contact to the protein side chain that form the S subpocket of WT CLpro A key difference with PF reside in the lack of interaction between the inhibitor backbone and Gln a direct consequence of the cyclization on P which result in the loss of a hydrogen bond donor site The predict bind mode of ALG within CLpro provide some rationale for the amino acid substitution associate with resistance FigÂ C In particular residue and be locate within âÃ of the bind ALG This observation can be extend to both PF and nirmatrelvir base on crystal structure from PDB code XHM and RFW respectively Consequently the observe substitution have a direct impact on the compoundtarget interaction E play a key role in compound bind with no little than three hydrogen bond form with the inhibitor The EA substitution eliminate one of the hydrogen bond make within the P subpocket interaction with this subpocket be important for substrate recognition by coronaviral CLpro enzyme and its occupancy in many case by a lactam moiety be a key driver for inhibitor potency It be therefore unsurprising that all three inhibitor be adversely affect by the EA change FigÂ C Meanwhile LF result in the presence of a bulky side chain on the neighbor position While this change do not directly conflict with compound bind the side chain of L be in close contact with other residue include Phe FigÂ Molecular dynamic MD simulation on the LF EA LF enzyme suggest that the bulky Phe side chain result in some distortion of the neighbor subpocket In particular the loop contain LF move away from F and the distance between the CÎ±s of F and LFP consistently increase result in a much open bind site and a suboptimal fit of the inhibitor even though Hbond interaction include the two remain Hbonds with the A backbone appear conserve throughout ns simulation FigÂ Interestingly all three inhibitor ALG PF and nirmatrelvir be affect by the LF change The reason behind the LF mutation remain much elusive as this residue fall outside direct Van der Waals or hydrogenbond contact range to ALG However the L side chain be locate only âÃ from Q a residue which can interact with the peptide backbone of this inhibitor class either directly as with PF or via water molecule FigÂ LF may therefore indirectly affect compound bind by alter the position of Q and the subsequent interaction mediate by this residue However a rigorous assessment of how this change impact enzyme activity andor inhibitor bind would require much elaborate technique eg free energy perturbation that be beyond the scope of this work Finally it be anticipate that the natural SARS CoV polyprotein substrate which be process by the CLpro be little affect by the LF EA andor LF substitution due to their large size and approximately fold high numb of polar interaction with the protease as observe in QG for SARS CoV CLpro in complex with bind substrateDISCUSSION Nirmatrelvir be the first oral SARSCoV CLpro protease inhibitor grant emergency use authorization by the US FDA for the treatment of COVID To avoid resistance development HIV and HCV protease inhibitor be use with great success in fixeddose combination with other directly act antiviral drug that have a different mechanism of action As a single agent several of this inhibitor select rapidly for drugresistant variant SARSCoV infection be typically acute in nature hence treatment can be of short duration which may largely reduce the likelihood that resistant variant develop Yet also for acute infection the emergence of drugresistant variant be a serious concern certainly in case that such variant can efficiently transmit result in a loss of therapeutic option for patient For example the firstgeneration influenza drug amantadanes be no long recommend as resistance to amantadine and rimantadine be widespread To monitor clinical drug resistance it be crucial to identify the mutation involve To that end we use the CLpro inhibitor ALG a probe compound in the context of a drug discovery program to select for resistant variant in vitro by passaging SARSCoV in the presence of increase drug concentration Similar experiment have be perform with SARSCoV neutralize antibody and polymerase inhibitor The selection process indicate that there be a significant barrier to resistance for the CLpro inhibitor ALG The first change be observe only between passage and to âdays this be the double substitution LF EA in CLpro which then evolve to the triple substitution LF EA LF Phenotyping this triple mutant virus reveal a Ã increase in the EC for ALG Moreover significant crossresistance Ã increase EC be observe with nirmatrelvir the active component of Paxlovid and PF a early CLpro clinical candidate Next we engineer a infectious clone with the only the Clpro substitution LF EA LF and the resistance against ALG nirmatrelvir and also ensitrelvir can be confirm Ã increase in EC As a 2 confirmation a cellbased assay be use with heterologous expression of wildtype and mutate CLpro LF EA LF and a substrate link to a reporter protein The EC value for ALG and nirmatrelvir in this assay increase Ã and Ã respectively compare with the wild type Importantly all of the virus analyze remain fully susceptible to the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir g form We far characterize the CLpro substitution use biochemical assay enzyme carry the single substitution LF EA or LF be find to have markedly low enzymatic activity compare to the wild type Each of the enzyme be also little efficiently inhibit by the CLpro inhibitor The large increase in IC be observe when all three substitution LF EA LF be combine For this triple mutant enzyme the IC for ALG nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir increase by Ã Ã and Ã respectively A structural biology analysis reveal that the substitution decrease interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitor EA cause a direct loss of a hydrogen bond with the lactam moiety that be find in all the inhibitor test here LF increase the size of the bind pocket cause a decrease of the Van der Waals force between enzyme and inhibitor and LF be think to change the rotamer conformation of Q which for the wild type have many interaction with the inhibitor through a network of water molecule The loss of interaction result from amino acid substitution associate with resistance may have a low effect on substrate than on inhibitor as the former rely on a significantly high numb of interaction for bind Consequently this resistanceassociated mutation seem to allow a good discrimination between substrate and inhibitor at the expense of intrinsic enzymatic activity A recent sequence analysis across million global SARSCoV isolate circulate prior to the introduction of Paxlovid show a high genetic conservation of the CLpro protein From the amino acid position only have a polymorphism in of the sample and have a change in to of the sample change at position L E or L have a prevalence E display extreme high conservation in this datum set with sample have a alternative amino acid At this moment peerreviewed information on resistance against CLpro inhibitor in COVID patient be to our knowledge not available The Paxlovid label indicate that EV be much common in nirmatrelvirritonavirtreated subject relative to placebotreated subject and respectively and in one patient with a baseline LF substitution the EV substitution cooccurred with LF on day of treatment Both this observation be in accordance with the result describe above While we can clearly observe resistance of different CLpro inhibitor for the LF EA LV virus we can not fully characterize the contribution of each substitution by itself During the selection experiment LF together with EA be select first and LV be acquire late Additional cellbased experiment demonstrate that a LFcarrying virus be not resistant while biochemical experiment indicate that EA and LF be associate with resistance take this finding together we hypothesize that EA be the main driver for resistance that LF be need to support EA and that the presence of LF far increase resistance It would require a extensive study of the replication capacity of the different variant to support this hypothesis Importantly clear nirmatrelvirensitrelvir crossresistance be observe with both the EA LF and LF EA LF virus During the write of this manuscript two other study on the selection of nirmatrelvirresistant SARSCoV virus be report One group performedâ independent selection experiment result in the identification of multiple pathway of nirmatrelvir resistance They conclude that EV confer the high level of resistance of all substitution test Ã for nirmatrelvir Ã for ensitrelvir In addition this author show that EV cause a reduce fitness that be restore by add LF or TI The selection of LF EV by nirmatrelvir in vitro have also be report by another group Also this author come to the conclusion that EV be responsible for resistance whereas LF be a compensatory substitution require for maintain fitness As EA and EV be very similar substitution alanine and valine have similar chemical structure this finding be in strong agreement with our observation A 3 group engineer a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus VSVvariant which have SARSCoV CLpro express in a artificial polyprotein for which the replication depend on CLpro activity Selection for nirmatrelvir resistance result in the appearance of LF in the absence of other mutation and a engineer SARSCoV infectious clone with only the LF substitution show a marginal level of resistance for nirmatrelvir Ã increase EC Important to mention be also the work of Flynn et al who perform different functional CLpro screen in yeast to study the resilience of all amino acid position toward substitution Interestingly the author conclude that position E be highly tolerant to substitution include the EA or EV substitution base on available structural biology datum of CLpro in complex with inhibitor or natural substrate and their functional screen datum this author identify EA and EQ as potentially resistanceassociated substitution Our report emphasize the need for additional research to elucidate potential resistance pathway of SARSCoV inhibitor in vitro It be also a start point for the surveillance of nirmatrelvir resistance and indicate the potential need for combination therapy with different class

treatment be often associate with the development of drugresistant virus In order to guide the use of novel antiviral it be essential to understand the risk of resistance development and to characterize the associate change in the viral gene and protein In this work we describe for the first time a pathway that allow SARSCoV to develop resistance against Paxlovid in vitro The characteristic of in vitro antiviral resistance development may be predictive for the clinical situation Therefore our work will be important for the management of COVID with Paxlovid and nextgeneration SARSCoV CLpro inhibitor INTRODUCTION There be a urgent need for potent and safe antiviral drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of SARSCoV infection Highly efficacious and safe viral protease inhibitor have contribute significantly to the effective treatment of infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus HCV coronavirus have two protease the main protease CLpro or Mpro and the papainlike protease CLpro be a cysteine protease that cleave the two polyprotein ppa and ppab of SARSCoV at different site result in various nonstructural protein which be key for viral replication The substrate of CLpro present a distinct glutamine at the P site LeuGlnSer Ala Gly while no know human protease recognize this cleavage site CLpro can thus be consider a highly attractive drug target for the development of SARSCoV antiviral The potential of CLpro inhibitor have become apparent with the development of nirmatrelvir PF a peptidomimetic reversible covalent inhibitor that be coformulated with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir the result combination be market as Paxlovid When treatment be initiate during the first day after symptom onset it result in substantial clinical benefit â We recently demonstrate that nirmatrelvir be equipotent in vitro against the current SARSCoV variant of concern VoC Nirmatrelvir protect Syrian golden hamster from intranasal infection with different VoCs and prevent transmission to untreated cohoused sentinel Other clinical candidate CLpro inhibitor include ensitrelvir S a nonpeptidic noncovalent SARSCoV CLpro inhibitor and PBI The clinical development of lufotrelvir a intravenous prodrug of PF have be discontinue Treatment with antiviral can result in the selection of resistant viral variant and subsequent therapeutic failure This have be describe extensively in the treatment of chronicpersistent or acute viral infection cause by HIV hepatitis B virus HBV hepatitis C virus HCV herpesvirus and influenza Importantly transmission of resistant virus have be report for HIV and influenza For SARSCoV selection of resistant isolate have only be describe for remdesivir a polymerase inhibitor In vitro selection with remdesivir result in the emergence of resistanceassociated mutation Yet in the clinical set treatment with remdesivir so far only lead to the selection of mutation that be associate with lowlevel resistance â A causal effect between SARSCoV resistance to any replicase inhibitor and therapy failure have not yet be demonstrate much likely because this inhibitor be not yet widely use in the clinic andor resistant variant may have a fitness disadvantage Here we report on a pathway by which SARSCoV achieve significant resistance and crossresistance to CLpro inhibitor during serial passage in cell culture in the presence of a firstgeneration CLpro inhibitor ALG This molecule be prepare as a tool compound in the context of a drug discovery programRESULTS SARSCoV acquire resistance to CLpro inhibitor during passage with ALG ALG be a SARSCoV inhibitor with a effective concentration EC of âÎ¼M when test for inhibition of SARSCoV isolate GHB a prototypic Wuhan isolate from a Belgian patient in VeroE cell TableÂ It have no effect on the viability of uninfected host cell at concentration up to âÎ¼M Since VeroE cell have a high efflux of some chemotypes all selection experiment antiviral assay and toxicity assay on this cell be perform in the presence of the Pglycoprotein Pgp efflux inhibitor CP âÎ¼M The antiviral activity of ALG can be ascribe to inhibition of CLpro inhibitory concentration IC âÎ¼M TableÂ and there be no relevant inhibitory effect on human cathepsin L IC âÎ¼M see TableÂ S in the supplemental material For comparative purpose the chemical structure of ALG and the clinical CLpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir PF and ensitrelvir be show in FigÂ Supplemental Material TABLEÂ SEnzymatic activity against CLpro and cathepsin L Download TableÂ S DOCX file MB Copyright Â© Jochmans et al This content be distribute under the term of the Creative common Attribution International licenseTo identify resistance development to CLpro inhibitor we passaged SARSCoVGHB in VeroE cell in the presence of increase concentration of ALG The selection start at a concentration of âÎ¼M and for each next passage the virus be culture at the same concentration a Ã high concentration and a Ã low concentration The culture demonstrate virus breakthrough as observe by a significant cytopathic effect at the high concentration be then use for the next passage We start this experiment in triplicate but for two trial we can not significantly increase the ALG concentration above âÎ¼M by passage this culture be therefore not far analyze In one culture however the concentration of ALG can be increase gradually to âÎ¼M at passage p day FigÂ and maintain for one passage at âÎ¼M but that concentration have to be decrease again to âÎ¼M for the subsequent passage to allow viral replication until p day FigÂ Wholegenome sequence Illumina be perform on RNA purify from harvest supernatant at passage and At p no mutation be identify in the CLpro gene but at p and p dominant mutation of the read be present that result in amino acid substitution LF EA and LF EA LF respectively FigÂ TableÂ As a control SARSCoV be also passaged at the same frequency in the absence of compound and no mutation be identify in the CLpro gene at any passage datum not show Selection over the full genome of all nonsynonymous nucleotide change which be present inâ of the read in any of the sample show that other nonsynonymous mutation also become fix TableÂ This can be explain by the fact that the nucleotide change result in the CLpro substitution occur in a minor variant that also have this background mutation Importantly all this other change be outside the CLpro gene or the CLpro cleavage site encode sequence TableÂ For phenotypic analysis a new virus stock p be grow in the presence of âÎ¼M ALG and the presence of LF EA LF be confirm by genotypic analysis Antiviral test with this stock show strong resistance to ALG and crossresistance to both nirmatrelvir and PF TableÂ The EC value for all this CLpro inhibitor be increasedâÃ As expect the sensitivity of the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir remain unchanged In a 2 series of experiment we investigate whether the observe amino acid substitution in CLpro be sufficient for the resistance phenotype To this end we engineer use a infectious clone virus stock with LF EA LF or LF EA LF Unfortunately we be not able to generate virus with EA or LF alone Genotypic analysis confirm the presence of the mutation and reveal that there be no other nonsynonymous mutation in the genome datum not show Antiviral test with this engineer virus show that LF by itself be not associate with resistance while EA LF and LF EA LF cause a Ã and Ã increase respectively in EC for ALG TableÂ Again crossresistance be detect for nirmatrelvir EC increase Ã with the LF EA LF virus At this stage of our study ensitrelvir become available we find that this molecule also show crossresistance EC increase Ã with LF EA LF For all protease inhibitor test we observe little resistance with the EA LF virus than with the LF EA LF virus Importantly all the virus analyze remain fully sensitive to remdesivir Resistance to CLpro inhibitor in a cellbased reporter assay The resistance profile be next confirm in a previously describe cellbased reporter assay of SARSCoV CLpro enzymatic function In this gainofsignal assay inhibition of CLpro result in a increase enhance green fluorescent protein eGFP signal introduce the three amino acid change LF EA LF into the construct result in a Ã and Ã loss of potency for ALG and nirmatrelvir respectively TableÂ The resistance level of the triple mutant against PF be Ã Effect of amino acid substitution on CLpro enzymatic activity Recombinant CLpro protein be produce with the LF EA and LF substitution alone or combine and their enzymatic activity be test in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET assay use a peptide substrate feature the canonical glutamine cleavage site In this assay wildtype WT CLpro show linear product conversion in the enzyme concentration range of to ânM FigÂ A compare with the WT protein all test mutant display reduce enzymatic activity FigÂ B EA and LF as single mutant reduce the activity to about to of that of the wild type whereas the LF substitution reduce the activity to as low as The enzyme contain the three substitution LF EA LF be little compromise than LF alone with activity compare with the WT The loss in enzymatic activity for each mutant may be attribute to a apparent reduce bind affinity for the substrate a loss in protein stability andor a reduce formation of active dimer FigÂ As we test only a single batch of recombinant protein for each mutant we cannot exclude that some of this reduce activity be due to a lowerquality enzyme preparation Ligandinduced protease activation and dimerization with a low concentration of active site inhibitor have previously be describe for MERS CLpro This be explain by the inhibitorstabilizing dimer formation by occupy only one of the two bind site while full occupancy of the two dimer active site result in complete enzyme inhibition FigÂ S Although we do not perform direct protein dimerization study we observe that the impair enzymatic activity of the mutant can be partially rescue with low concentration around âÎ¼M of ALG PF

licenseResistance to CLpro inhibitor in the biochemical assay base on the characterization of the different enzyme see above we decide to use all enzyme at a concentration of ânM to quantify the activity of the inhibitor The effect of the LF substitution can not be determine under this condition due to its low intrinsic enzymatic activity ALG nirmatrelvir and PF all inhibit WT CLpro with IC value range from to ânM TableÂ For ALG the IC increase Ã to Ã with single substitution EA and LF and reach Ã for the enzyme with LF EA LF In comparison the potency of nirmatrelvir be much affect by substitution EA versus LF Ã versus Ã and reach a Ã increase on the enzyme with the substitution For PF the shift in IC be in general low with a Ã change versus the enzyme with LF EA LF However the shift in IC be high Ã with the noncovalent and chemically distinct inhibitor ensitrelvirStructural biology and computational chemistry Experimental datum with the CLpro system and computational chemistry investigation be use to rationalize the phenotype observe for ALG in vitro PF and the associate crystal structure XHM provide a convenient start point for model ALG in the catalytic pocket of CLpro due to the structural similarity between the two compound In particular both structure feature a hydroxymethylketone warhead that bind covalently to Cys as good as a methoxyindoleP substituent Multiple conformation of ALG be use as input for dock calculation this yield a wellconverged predict bind mode of ALG covalently bind to the catalytic site of WT CLpro FigÂ A In line with the crystal structure disclose for similar compound eg XHM ALG be predict to form a covalent bond from the activate carbon atom of its hydroxymethylketone warhead to the side chain of the catalytic C residue anchor the inhibitor into the bind cleave of CLpro ALG form seven direct hydrogen bond with the SARS CoV CLpro catalytic site FigÂ B The oxygen atom of the inhibitorâs warhead interact with the backbone NH of C in the oxyanion hole The carbonyl oxygen of the P lactam hydrogenbonds to the side chain of H while the NH of the P lactam be involve in a bifurcate interaction with the side chain of E and the backbone carbonyl of F The peptide backbone of ALG anchor itself with hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of H and the backbone HN of E The NH function of the P indole hydrogenbonds the inhibitor to the backbone carbonyl of E The fuse bicyclic P substituent of ALG maximize Van der Waals interaction via extensive productive contact to the protein side chain that form the S subpocket of WT CLpro A key difference with PF reside in the lack of interaction between the inhibitor backbone and Gln a direct consequence of the cyclization on P which result in the loss of a hydrogen bond donor site The predict bind mode of ALG within CLpro provide some rationale for the amino acid substitution associate with resistance FigÂ C In particular residue and be locate within âÃ of the bind ALG This observation can be extend to both PF and nirmatrelvir base on crystal structure from PDB code XHM and RFW respectively Consequently the observe substitution have a direct impact on the compoundtarget interaction E play a key role in compound bind with no little than three hydrogen bond form with the inhibitor The EA substitution eliminate one of the hydrogen bond make within the P subpocket interaction with this subpocket be important for substrate recognition by coronaviral CLpro enzyme and its occupancy in many case by a lactam moiety be a key driver for inhibitor potency It be therefore unsurprising that all three inhibitor be adversely affect by the EA change FigÂ C Meanwhile LF result in the presence of a bulky side chain on the neighbor position While this change do not directly conflict with compound bind the side chain of L be in close contact with other residue include Phe FigÂ Molecular dynamic MD simulation on the LF EA LF enzyme suggest that the bulky Phe side chain result in some distortion of the neighbor subpocket In particular the loop contain LF move away from F and the distance between the CÎ±s of F and LFP consistently increase result in a much open bind site and a suboptimal fit of the inhibitor even though Hbond interaction include the two remain Hbonds with the A backbone appear conserve throughout ns simulation FigÂ Interestingly all three inhibitor ALG PF and nirmatrelvir be affect by the LF change The reason behind the LF mutation remain much elusive as this residue fall outside direct Van der Waals or hydrogenbond contact range to ALG However the L side chain be locate only âÃ from Q a residue which can interact with the peptide backbone of this inhibitor class either directly as with PF or via water molecule FigÂ LF may therefore indirectly affect compound bind by alter the position of Q and the subsequent interaction mediate by this residue However a rigorous assessment of how this change impact enzyme activity andor inhibitor bind would require much elaborate technique eg free energy perturbation that be beyond the scope of this work Finally it be anticipate that the natural SARS CoV polyprotein substrate which be process by the CLpro be little affect by the LF EA andor LF substitution due to their large size and approximately fold high numb of polar interaction with the protease as observe in QG for SARS CoV CLpro in complex with bind substrateDISCUSSION Nirmatrelvir be the first oral SARSCoV CLpro protease inhibitor grant emergency use authorization by the US FDA for the treatment of COVID To avoid resistance development HIV and HCV protease inhibitor be use with great success in fixeddose combination with other directly act antiviral drug that have a different mechanism of action As a single agent several of this inhibitor select rapidly for drugresistant variant SARSCoV infection be typically acute in nature hence treatment can be of short duration which may largely reduce the likelihood that resistant variant develop Yet also for acute infection the emergence of drugresistant variant be a serious concern certainly in case that such variant can efficiently transmit result in a loss of therapeutic option for patient For example the firstgeneration influenza drug amantadanes be no long recommend as resistance to amantadine and rimantadine be widespread To monitor clinical drug resistance it be crucial to identify the mutation involve To that end we use the CLpro inhibitor ALG a probe compound in the context of a drug discovery program to select for resistant variant in vitro by passaging SARSCoV in the presence of increase drug concentration Similar experiment have be perform with SARSCoV neutralize antibody and polymerase inhibitor The selection process indicate that there be a significant barrier to resistance for the CLpro inhibitor ALG The first change be observe only between passage and to âdays this be the double substitution LF EA in CLpro which then evolve to the triple substitution LF EA LF Phenotyping this triple mutant virus reveal a Ã increase in the EC for ALG Moreover significant crossresistance Ã increase EC be observe with nirmatrelvir the active component of Paxlovid and PF a early CLpro clinical candidate Next we engineer a infectious clone with the only the Clpro substitution LF EA LF and the resistance against ALG nirmatrelvir and also ensitrelvir can be confirm Ã increase in EC As a 2 confirmation a cellbased assay be use with heterologous expression of wildtype and mutate CLpro LF EA LF and a substrate link to a reporter protein The EC value for ALG and nirmatrelvir in this assay increase Ã and Ã respectively compare with the wild type Importantly all of the virus analyze remain fully susceptible to the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir g form We far characterize the CLpro substitution use biochemical assay enzyme carry the single substitution LF EA or LF be find to have markedly low enzymatic activity compare to the wild type Each of the enzyme be also little efficiently inhibit by the CLpro inhibitor The large increase in IC be observe when all three substitution LF EA LF be combine For this triple mutant enzyme the IC for ALG nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir increase by Ã Ã and Ã respectively A structural biology analysis reveal that the substitution decrease interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitor EA cause a direct loss of a hydrogen bond with the lactam moiety that be find in all the inhibitor test here LF increase the size of the bind pocket cause a decrease of the Van der Waals force between enzyme and inhibitor and LF be think to change the rotamer conformation of Q which for the wild type have many interaction with the inhibitor through a network of water molecule The loss of interaction result from amino acid substitution associate with resistance may have a low effect on substrate than on inhibitor as the former rely on a significantly high numb of interaction for bind Consequently this resistanceassociated mutation seem to allow a good discrimination between substrate and inhibitor at the expense of intrinsic enzymatic activity A recent sequence analysis across million global SARSCoV isolate circulate prior to the introduction of Paxlovid show a high genetic conservation of the CLpro protein From the amino acid position only have a polymorphism in of the sample and have a change in to of the sample change at position L E or L have a prevalence E display extreme high conservation in this datum set with sample have a alternative amino acid At this moment peerreviewed information on resistance against CLpro inhibitor in COVID patient be to our knowledge not available The Paxlovid label indicate that EV be much common in nirmatrelvirritonavirtreated subject relative to placebotreated subject and respectively and in one patient with a baseline LF substitution the EV substitution cooccurred with LF on day of treatment Both this observation be in accordance with the result describe above While we can clearly observe resistance of different CLpro inhibitor for the LF EA LV virus we can not fully characterize the contribution of each substitution by itself During the selection experiment LF together with EA be select first and LV be acquire late Additional cellbased experiment demonstrate that a LFcarrying virus be not resistant while biochemical experiment indicate that EA and LF be associate with resistance take this finding together we hypothesize that EA be the main driver for resistance that LF be need to support EA and that the presence of LF far increase resistance It would require a extensive study of the replication capacity of the different variant to support this hypothesis Importantly clear nirmatrelvirensitrelvir crossresistance be observe with both the EA LF and LF EA LF virus During the write of this manuscript two other study on the selection of nirmatrelvirresistant SARSCoV virus be report One group performedâ independent selection experiment result in the identification of multiple pathway of nirmatrelvir resistance They conclude that EV confer the high level of resistance of all substitution test Ã for nirmatrelvir Ã for ensitrelvir In addition this author show that EV cause a reduce fitness that be restore by add LF or TI The selection of LF EV by nirmatrelvir in vitro have also be report by another group Also this author come to the conclusion that EV be responsible for resistance whereas LF be a compensatory substitution require for maintain fitness As EA and EV be very similar substitution alanine and valine have similar chemical structure this finding be in strong agreement with our observation A 3 group engineer a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus VSVvariant which have SARSCoV CLpro express in a artificial polyprotein for which the replication depend on CLpro activity Selection for nirmatrelvir resistance result in the appearance of LF in the absence of other mutation and a engineer SARSCoV infectious clone with only the LF substitution show a marginal level of resistance for nirmatrelvir Ã increase EC Important to mention be also the work of Flynn et al who perform different functional CLpro screen in yeast to study the resilience of all amino acid position toward substitution Interestingly the author conclude that position E be highly tolerant to substitution include the EA or EV substitution base on available structural biology datum of CLpro in complex with inhibitor or natural substrate and their functional screen datum this author identify EA and EQ as potentially resistanceassociated substitution Our report emphasize the need for additional research to elucidate potential resistance pathway of SARSCoV inhibitor in vitro It be also a start point for the surveillance of nirmatrelvir resistance and indicate the potential need for combination therapy with different class of SARSCoV inhibitorsMATERIALS AND method compound cell virus protein and peptide ALG nirmatrelvir and PF be synthesize by Aligos Therapeutics and purify to purity The synthesis of ALG be describe in

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v21i2.2081","INTRODUCTION human have be produce and consume yogurt for several millennium as fermentation have historically be the only reliable method for preserve milk besides dry it ferment milk product can be find in almost every culture and have even be observe in Egyptian hieroglyph The early record reference to the health benefit of consume yogurt date back to Indian script from BC Today yogurt remain one of the much popular ferment dairy product worldwide make up a billiondollar industry Thus yogurt make be often teach in microbiology laboratory course as a way to introduce student to the basic of microbiology and its application in food preservation Although student can produce yogurt due to safety concern they be often not allow to taste the yogurt they produce which can lead to student dissatisfaction and lack of engagement with the laboratory procedure Therefore we design a laboratory exercise in which student deconstruct commercially available yogurt to identify the two main bacterium present Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus Federal regulation require that anything sell as âyogurtâ contain only this two species of bacterium The variety of texture and flavor that be achieve between the different commercially available yogurt be due to strain difference of this two bacterial species as good as difference in the way the yogurt be process This handson procedure introduce student to the basic concept of food fermentation and allow them to practice many of the basic microbiology technique they have be learn while mitigate the safety concern around food preparation in a laboratory settingLEARNING objective Due to the large nature of the microbiology class at our institution section student per section find a alternative space in which student can prepare yogurt have become untenable Therefore in order to still allow student to interact with microbe involve in the fermentation process we create a laboratory exercise in which student be task with identify the bacterium in commercially available storebought yogurt Prior to the begin of this activity student have receive a lecture on the role of microorganism in the fermentation of human food which include how yogurt and cheese be produce At the end of this activity which be design to occur over the course of four dayslab period student will be able to Gram stain and identify the bacterial species use in yogurt production collect and analyze result from MRS agar and phenol red broth to identify the bacterial species use in yogurt production provide the characteristic of bacterial species use in yogurt production and explain the role of bacterium and their metabolism in make yogurtPROCEDURE student work in pair follow the protocol provide in Appendix A visual representation of the four day of task can be find in Figure On the first day a single container of CHOBANI Greek unflavored yogurt be provide to the class On day student be task with Gram stain the yogurt and streak the yogurt on a MRS plate Hardy Diagnostics This agar be develop as a alternative nonselective medium for the cultivation of fastidious Lactobacillus On day student have to identify the two different type of bacterium on their MRS plate base on the provide colony morphology and choose one of each type to streak for isolation of colony on new MRS plate As the two bacterial species be not present in equal density the isolation of colony be a challenge but attainable task for student On day student Gram stain each isolate bacterial type to confirm isolation and inoculate sucrose and glucose phenol red broth with Durham tube On day student record the result of their phenol red broth and confirm the identification of their two species of bacterium During the lab student record their result on the provide worksheet Appendix This worksheet also include a numb of question for student to answer regard the procedure and reagent use as good as the overall fermentation process that occur in yogurt All work for this activity should be perform in a biosafety level BSL space and assume student have have basic safety train in perform laboratory experiment with bacterium instructor should refer to the ASM BSL guideline for laboratory space requirement personal protection requirement and standard laboratory practice In particular instructor should make sure that student have be instruct on safe use of Bunsen burner the safe handle of bacterium and the proper method for dispose of

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00856-21","LETTER We read with interest the publication by NougayrÃ¨de and coworker who describe that Escherichia coli strain Nissle EcN be mutagenic by mean of its express colibactin The contribution of this work on the biological activity of colibactin be of high significance and increase our knowledge on this enigmatic toxin The use of mouse model be a important methodology to study the effect of colibactin in vivo NougayrÃ¨de et al provide evidence that EcN have genotoxic potential in the model they apply The topic of colibactin be of extreme importance to our company as patient and consumer safety have our utmost priority the use of probiotic product that contain EcN as a active ingredient should not have health risk That have be the basis of our companyâs strategy in the past and it remain our focus in the present and future For this reason database on drug side effect such as EudraVigilance the European database of suspect adverse drug reaction report wwwadrreportseu be closely be monitor So far this show no evidence of a potential cancer risk from intake of EcN As this matter be of high concern to us we have conduct genotoxicity test that be compliant with FDA recommendation and OECD guideline this guideline have be define to detect genotoxicity of a give compound and commercial company be oblige to follow such guideline This include use of the Ames test perform accord to the original test protocol and additionally with slight modification for test live EcN bacterium No mutagenic or cytotoxic effect of live EcN or its metabolite be find with this test Needless to say test be perform accord to good manufacture practice GMP standard with inclusion of all appropriate control this control identify that the numb of spontaneous revertants in the Ames test be in accordance with the frequency range report in the literature and with inhouse historical datum compare to this control the presence of EcN do not raise the numb of revertant colony of the Ames strain and it do not reduce the numb of the Ames strain colony by kill them a conclusion that be unfortunately inaccurately draw from our work by NougayrÃ¨de and colleague The background lawn obtain in the Ames test indicate the absence of any cytotoxic effect by EcN a observation that we possibly do not point out clearly enough in our publication We observe a background lawn of the EcN sample that in all case be identical to that of the HO control Thus a possible kill effect by microcins or any other antagonistic influence of EcN on the use Salmonella Ames reporter strain can safely be exclude The 2 OECDapproved technique we use be the in vivo mammalian alkaline comet assay use rat which be also recommend by the FDA for detection of DNA strand break In contrast NougayrÃ¨de et al use two alternative mouse model One model utilize axenic mouse that be monoassociated once with EcN and sacrifice day late Their 2 model use dayold mouse pup that be sacrifice only h after a single exposure to EcN Colon tissue from animal of both model be assess immunohistologically for the presence of histone Î³HAX In the rodent model we use to weekold SPF rat be feed EcN daily for day or day Despite this much long exposure histological examination and comet assay of the specify gut tissue do not detect any mutagenic effect of EcN As mention above the comet assay be highly appropriate in light of the propose activity of colibactin to induce DNA strand break We point out that Pharmaceutical market Authorisation holder be expect to use standardize guidelinedefined test for comparison of obtain datum The comet assay do not display any genotoxic activity of EcN but that do not make the assay âinappropriateâ as express by NougayrÃ¨de et al The contradictory datum obtain with the different animal model can be cause by multiple factor include the presence or absence of a mature immune system a natural microbiota and a intact intestinal barrier all of which much likely reduce the direct cellcell contact that be consider essential for the action of colibactin This be not to say that we be not concern about the genotoxic potential of pksE coli include EcN that have be demonstrate by alternative test as this potentially point toward a negative impact on human health and a role of colibactin in the development of colorectal cancer CRC As NougayrÃ¨de and colleague correctly state EcN be administer to infant In this context we draw attention to a recent publication describe natural mothertoinfant transmission of pksE coli strain in newborn that author conclude that âa respectable numb of healthy individual may become predispose to a high risk of CRC at the very early stage of lifeâ We can confirm that pksE coli bacterium be common in infant base on as yet unpublished datum In a randomize control trial unpublished datum EcN or placebo be give to newborn and again at the age of âyear A year late stool sample be analyze for the presence of pk by PCR and pk be find in approximately of infant in both group The incidence of pksE coli in a general population have be estimate between and â assume that all phylotype B E coli strain contain the pk locus Numerous study have demonstrate that CRC patient be much often colonize by phylotype B E coli eg reference and a overrepresentation of pksE coli be also demonstrate A molecular signature of DNA damage that can be attribute to colibactin activity be demonstrate in wholegenome sequence WGS datum obtain from CRC tumor However this apply to only of the investigate WGS datum If infant be already frequently colonize by pksbearing strain if this strain be persistent over time and if they be able to induce colorectal cancer late in life it need to be explain why only such a relatively small fraction of CRC tumor bear this signature This paradox have also be notice by other suggest that the presence of commensal pk bacterium alone be likely insufficient for cancer development and such bacterium exert a carcinogenic influence only under specific condition The genotoxic activity of colibactin be observe only follow direct cellcell contact plus the transcriptional activation of all clb gene of the pk island seem to be require The direct cellcell contact of pk strain with host epithelium cell be not only hamper by presence of mucus in the gut but the intestinal barrier be even enhance by EcNâs ability to promote mucus production and to seal the tight junction Transcriptional regulation of clb gene be influence by many factor eg metabolite and transcription of several clb component be promote by inflammation but EcN be know to be antiinflammatory by modulate the host immune system in multiple way Beside the discuss genotoxic potential of pksE coli there be other hostderived biological impact in human Obviously the onset of CRC be multifactorial to which genetic factor and diet also contribute Additionally DNA damage repair response play a important role review in for example reference and It be therefore relevant to consider the possibility that much of the DNA damage induce by colibactin would be repair or would generally result in apoptosis Moreover chronic inflammation be a know trigger of CRC EcN reduce the risk of colitisassociated CRC as demonstrate in ulcerative colitis UC patient who maintain in remission by intake of EcN due to its antiinflammatory activity that be similar in potency to mesalazine In addition by mean of microcin expression EcN limit the presence of proinflammatory species of the family Enterobacteriaceae Moreover EcN do not increase microsatellite instability in UC patient It be not our intention to downplay the important finding report by NougayrÃ¨de and coworker in any way We just want to point out that the biological relevance of their finding generate by in vitro and in vivo murine model may not paint a complete picture of the intricate relationship between the human host and its natural gut microflora or a microflora influence by intake of probiotic bacterium While we and other continue our research to elucidate this we remain vigilant to react quickly in case evidence emerge that would suggest our EcNbased probiotic product would harm consumer"

supercoiling reaction buff for min at Â°C The trap enzymeDNA complex be resolve by use native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualize with a phosphorimager FLA GE Healthcare The fold increase in the formation of enzymeDNA complex in the presence of FQs be calculate with respect to the complex form in the absence of the drugFluorescence measurement The fluorescence measurement be carry out with a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter fit with a polarizer All of the fluorescence measurement be take use a slit width of mm a PMT voltage of V and a integration time of s The assay be carry out at specific excitationemission wavelength of nm for MFX and nm for CFX respectively Fluorescence anisotropy titration be carry out at fix concentration of the FQs and with increase concentration of DNA

interaction a nM concentration of be tuberculosis DNA gyrase be incubate with various concentration to nM of CFX or MFX The ratio of change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein excitation nm emission nm at a give drug concentration ÎF and the change at infinite concentration of the drug ÎFmax be plot against the drug concentration The plot be fit and analyze by the Hill bind equation in GraphPad Prism The drugenzyme interaction be also monitor by the spin column gel filtration method result DNA cleavage in the presence of FQs Although CFX and OFX be widely use FQs for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infection several study show their low efficacy against be tuberculosis â However the FQs with methoxy substitution at C MFX and GFX exhibit potent antimycobacterial activity and also inhibit mycobacterial DNA gyrase at low concentration unpublished result The DNA supercoiling reaction catalyze by gyrase involve two sequential transesterification reaction and a intermediate strand passage step to pass the intact duplex DNA through the cleave DNA The FQs trap the covalent complex form by gyrase with DNA during the first transesterification reaction convert the enzyme into a doublestrand cleave endonuclease To analyze the basis of the differential susceptibility of the mycobacterial gyrase to the FQs DNA cleavage experiment be carry out with be tuberculosis DNA gyrase The cleavage induce by MFX or GFX be two to three time much than with CFX or OFX Fig A A similar pattern be observe with be smegmatis DNA gyrase datum not show this result be consistent with the result obtain in DNA supercoiling assay where to foldhigher inhibition be see with MFX The increase cleavage see in the presence of MFX can be due to increase complex formation between the DNA and the enzyme in the presence of the compound Electrophoretic mobility shift assay be carry out to assess the extent of complex formation in the presence of the two FQs by incubate â²endlabeled bp DNA with the enzyme and nM CFX or MFX a increase in the enzymeDNA complex be see indicate the formation of a FQ stabilize complex Importantly the extent of complex formation be fold much with MFX than with CFX Fig B early study indicate that quinolone and FQs induce a different cleavage pattern by the E coli DNA gyrase However the differential interaction of two FQs with a give gyrase have not be investigate The FQs interact with the enzymeDNA complex near the active site Due to the difference in their chemical nature the interaction with the FQs may involve different residue The difference in the extent of complex formation and DNA cleavage see in the presence of CFX and MFX may arise due to difference in their interaction To evaluate whether this difference be also associate with a distinct cleavage pattern assay be carry out with a linear DNA fragment label at the â² end In the presence of CFX three cleave DNA fragment be see whereas MFXinduced cleavage result in a additional DNA fragment Fig A In contrast the cleavage pattern be similar in the presence of both CFX and MFX with E coli enzyme see Fig S in the supplemental material To investigate whether the interaction of CFX and MFX with the mycobacterial gyrase occur at the same site cleavage competition assay be carry out use a fix concentration of one FQ and increase the concentration of the other increase the concentration of MFX lead to the appearance of the MFXspecific cleavage product whereas it gradually disappear with a increase in CFX concentration Fig B From this datum it be evident that this two FQs compete to the same bind site and when bind induce their respective characteristic cleavage pattern Interaction of the FQs with the be tuberculosis DNA gyrase To understand the basis of the differential interaction of CFX and MFX with the be tuberculosis gyrase and to evaluate the mechanism of action of the FQs fluorescence anisotropy assay be carry out The technique provide a sensitive and realtime measurement of the molecular interaction occur in solution The interaction of small fluorescent ligand with large receptor protein molecule can be conveniently monitor by this technique Many FQs be intrinsically fluorescent enable the measurement of their interaction with the gyrase andor DNA by a change in anisotropy Initially a set of control experiment be carry out before monitor the interaction of the FQs with the enzymeDNA complex A nM concentration of CFX or MFX be titrate with a range of enzyme concentration Surprisingly a concentrationdependent increase in anisotropy be observe in this control experiment which have only FQ and the enzyme The bind of the FQs to the enzyme reach saturation at high concentration of the enzyme Fig A Notably MFX bind induce significantly high change in anisotropy compare to CFX Fig A In experiment with and nM concentration the FQs also show a similar pattern of interaction datum not show A numb of previous study have show the requirement of DNA for gyraseFQ interaction â Moreover the bind of FQs on their own to the enzyme be not apparent in this study Thus to rule out the possibility that enzyme preparation contain contaminate DNA which can have contribute to the observe drug bind to the enzyme the follow experiment be carry out First the enzyme be treat with DNase I over a extend period of time see material and method before carry out fluorescence measurement The bind of both CFX and MFX to the enzyme remain unaltered Fig B In another important control experiment the enzyme be subject to proteinase K treatment before the measurement In the latter case the change in anisotropy be negligible indicate that in the experimental condition use the FQs bind to the enzyme directly Fig A Next to monitor the role of DNA in FQgyrase interaction CFX or MFX be incubate with gyraseDNA complex as describe in material and method which result in alter interaction as see by change in anisotropy Fig C However similar to the pattern see with free enzyme the interaction of MFX with the enzymeDNA complex be good than CFX Fluorescencequenching and spin column gel filtration experiment indicate that MFX bind be tuberculosis gyrase good than CFX see Fig SA and B in the supplemental material When the bind of DNA alone to FQs be monitor in a separate experiment surprisingly a much low change in anisotropy be observe see Fig S in the supplemental material The implication of this finding be elaborate in the late part of the manuscript Although the experiment with the be tuberculosis enzyme describe above show a direct interaction between FQs and the gyrase in the case of E coli gyrase FQ bind require the enzymeDNA complex â To examine whether the DNA gyrases from two different bacterium do indeed exhibit different interaction pattern with the FQs we carry out assay with the E coli enzyme Anisotropic change be see when the E coli gyrase be incubate with either of the FQs Fig A However in contrast to the pattern see in case of be tuberculosis gyrase the bind of both the FQs to E coli enzyme seem to be comparable Fig A The bind be remarkably poor in the case of OXO datum not show a weak inhibitor of the E coli enzyme much importantly prior digestion of the enzyme sample with the DNase I similar to the experiment with the be tuberculosis enzyme do not affect the bind of the FQs to the E coli gyrase Fig B However with the proteinase K treatment to the enzyme the bind of FQs be nearly abolish Fig A Although from this study it be evident that FQs can bind directly to DNA gyrase holoenzymes from two different species they do not reveal whether the drug preferentially bind to only one of the subunit or whether the assemble tetrameric holoenzyme be necessary for bind To determine whether the FQs bind only to the holoenzyme or also to individual subunit fluorescence anisotropy measurement be carry out with individual subunit of the be tuberculosis gyrase From the datum show in Fig A it be evident that both FQs can bind to the GyrA subunit itself to a extent similar to that of the holoenzyme Notably the GyrA interaction with MFX seem to be markedly high than to CFX Fig A a low degree of bind of GyrB to FQs be see Fig A Together this result imply that be tuberculosis GyrA be primarily involve in interaction with the FQs and the contribution from GyrB alone or GyrB in complex with GyrA ie in the holoenzyme context appear to be minimal Interestingly in the experiment with individual subunit of E coli gyrase we observe different result the bind of either the GyrA or GyrB subunit of the E coli enzyme be substantially low and only the assemble holoenzyme be competent for both CFXMFX bind Fig B this result be in contrast to that of a early study in which E coli GyrA be show to interact with CFX FQ bind experiment be also carry out with Topo IV another type II topoisomerase present in E coli and its subunit ParC and ParE Topo IV alone can bind to CFX and MFX in the absence of DNA similar to E coli gyrase subunit the individual subunit of topo IV show low degree of interaction with the FQs see Fig SA and B in the supplemental material From the abovedescribed experiment it be apparent that CFX and MFX show a difference in the interaction with the be tuberculosis gyrase which explain the basis for their different inhibition potential One of the much likely reason for the FQ resistance acquire upon mutation in the quinolone resistancedetermining region QRDR would be the weak interaction of the FQs with the enzyme To investigate whether a mutation in QRDR affect FQenzyme interaction we choose one of the much common QRDR mutant Among all QRDR mutation serine S and aspartate have mutation in the GyrA subunit be much common in gyrases from various bacterium Indeed a mutation in have correspond to have in E coli GyrA see Fig S in the supplemental material confer FQ resistance to both the be tuberculosis and the be smegmatis DNA gyrase Fluorescence anisotropy experiment show a substantially weak bind of FQs with either DG GyrA alone or the be smegmatis holoenzyme contain DG GyrA Fig However the bind of CFX and MFX to the wildtype be smegmatis GyrA or holoenzyme be similar to the result obtain with GyrA or the holoenzyme from be tuberculosis DISCUSSION By virtue of their ability to trap the gyraseDNA covalent complex lead to the generation of doublestrand break in the genome FQs have be subject to intensive study in order to find much effective derivative â As a result a numb of new FQs with vary inhibitory potency against different bacterium have be characterize In parallel their mechanism of action have be also study extensively to develop molecule with improve ability to induce doublestrand cleavage Initial effort in understand the mechanism involve ultrafiltration and equilibrium dialysis method in order to monitor the enzyme and DNA interaction with Hnorfloxacin A strong bind of the drug to DNA but a insignificant bind to the enzyme be report In addition the drug be show to preferentially bind to the singlestranded DNA Next the DNA bind be show to be dependent on the concentration of Mg Subsequent surface plasmon resonance study on FQDNA interaction use singlestranded DNA show a sequencedependent bind with high affinity whereas doublestranded DNA bind seem to be sequence independent In a separate study the bind of norfloxacin to unique site in the enzymeDNA complex be observe implicate the interaction of the FQs with both the gyrase and DNA The interaction of the FQs with the enzymeDNA complex be establish by several other study â However in this study the direct bind of FQs to the enzyme itself be not apparent and the basis for the vary FQ susceptibility of gyrases from different bacterium and the occurrence of a large numb of quinoloneresistance mutation be unexplained to a large extent In a recent study however the contribution of a watermetal ion bridge for Topo IVquinolone interaction and its stabilization by two amino acid residue of the QRDR have be demonstrate In order to address the problem and to account for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrases to FQs we revisit the mechanism of FQgyrase interaction We find two distinct way in which the interaction of FQs with the enzyme be achieve In the establish mode know for much than a decade FQs bind to the enzymeDNA complex prior or after DNA cleavage Fig We describe the bind of the enzyme to FQ before the bind to DNA a mode of interaction indicate in a early work with E coli gyrase Moreover from our study it appear that the bind of the drug to DNA be unlikely to be a major mechanism of drug action under physiological condition However to investigate whether FQs bind DNA we carry out experiment use the condition describe in early study When mM KCl be use to monitor the interaction the bind of CFXMFX to DNA be see as report early see Fig S in the supplemental material However bind of FQs to the enzyme alone be also observe and bind of the drug to the enzymeDNA complex be great than the FQ bind to either the enzyme or DNA Importantly in assay where the salt concentration use be close to physiological level FQs exhibit a weak DNAbinding ability see Fig S in the supplemental material the FQs bind the enzyme alone as good the enzymeDNA complex Fig A and C The bind of the FQs to the enzymeDNA complex have be investigate extensively the drug may bind to the gyraseDNA complex and induce the cleavage of the DNA Alternatively or additionally the drug may bind to the gyraseDNA covalent complex and stabilize the cleave complex summarize in Fig The net outcome of both the pathway be the accumulation of cleave ternary complex The direct bind of FQ to the enzyme describe here be likely to be a early step in the reaction Fig see also Fig S in the supplemental material Normally much of the DNA gyrase holoenzyme would be bind to the DNA to carry out the supercoiling function in vivo However some free subunit and holoenzymes generate due to dissociation from the DNA and continuous protein synthesis during the exponential phase of growth would be available for FQ bind In one scenario such FQgyrase complex may occlude DNA bind result in a inhibition of activity similar to the mechanism of inhibition observe with endogenous gyrase inhibitory protein â A numb of them directly bind to the gyrase and sequester the enzyme away from DNA account for the phenotypic resistance against FQs â However in contrast we do see that the enzymeFQ complex have also the ability to bind DNA see Fig S in the supplemental material thus confine the inhibition mechanism to the establish mode viz doublestranded cleavage in the ternary complex Fig The direct bind of FQs to either the E coli holoenzyme or the GyrA of the be tuberculosis gyrase seem to account for the differential susceptibility see with different drug The good bind of MFX to the GyrA of the latter enzyme seem to directly correlate to increase ternary complex formation and cleave product It also account for the high inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the enzyme see with MFX early The similar interaction of both CFX and MFX to the E coli gyrase correlate good with the comparable DNA cleavage see in the presence of the drug see Fig S in the supplemental material In support of this the inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the E coli enzyme be comparable to both CFX and MFX Similarly OXO a weak inhibitor of the E coli gyrase demonstrate little bind datum not show far the finding present here can account for the occurrence of a large numb of FQresistant mutation in the QRDR of both GyrA and GyrB subunit confer various degree of resistance give that the primary QRDR reside in the amino terminus of the GyrA subunit mutation in the GyrA subunit result in highlevel resistance whereas that in GyrB tend to result in lowlevel resistance However the frequency of the occurrence of mutation in the two gene seem to be highly vary in different organism For example in a study analyze the FQ resistance in be tuberculosis of FQresistant strain be find to contain a singlesite mutation in the gyrase gene Among this single site mutant isolate contain mutation in gyrA and only in gyrB In addition among isolate contain much than one mutation in the gyr locus isolate have multiple mutation in gyrA and only one isolate contain a double mutation in gyrB In contrast such a bias in mutation frequency be not see in E coli where out of spontaneous FQresistant strain select in vitro have mutation in gyrA and the rest map to gyrB Thus the bind pattern of the FQs to the two gyrases seem to correlate good with the distribution of the resistance mutation However in the laboratoryconducted experiment the mutation frequency in the particular allele gyrA or gyrB be dependent on the drug its concentration choose for the study and a numb of other variable Structural study of the gyraseTopo IVDNA complex and FQs have be carry out with the objective of visualize the molecular interaction in the ternary complex In the structure of FQtrapped Streptococcus pneumonia Topo IV two FQ molecule be show to interact with the cleave DNA prevent the â²OH group from attack the phosphotyrosine for religation while the structure of the Acinetobacter baumannii Topo IVDNA complex trap with MFX show Mg bridge proteinFQ contact The mutation of the residue involve in the Mg bridge contact with FQs reduce the interaction establish the importance of the FQs bind to the enzymeDNA complex for efficient inhibition give the high degree of similarity between the gyrase and Topo IV in the aminoterminal region of GyrA and ParC one would expect a similar interaction pattern between the gyrase and FQ However CFX bind to the Staphylococcus aureus gyraseDNA complex show a different orientation of the drug compare to the MFXTopo IV complex The dock of MFX on the be tuberculosis DNA gyrase reaction core along with DNA indicate that the drug contact both subunit in the enzymeDNA complex However the overwhelm incidence of QRDR mutation map to the GyrA of be tuberculosis be a indication of a major role for GyrA in FQ bind The GyrB bind show in the dock model may have a role in stabilize the interaction in the ternary complex In conclusion the bind of FQs to the enzyme itself and the enzymeDNA complex may have physiological implication in the development of resistance and also account for the differential susceptibility of the enzyme to different FQs The frequency of distribution of mutation in GyrA and GyrB seem to indicate whether a give FQ preferentially bind to one of the subunit or the holoenzyme from different bacterium The highaffinity bind of the FQs to the gyrase itself demonstrate here may open up avenue for structural study of the complex between the drug and the enzyme pave the way for the generation of much potent lead

severe survivor cohort at the latter time point Interestingly tPA and soluble CD ligand sCDL level be significantly different in the mild survivor group only at the early disease stage FigÂ have and F this result indicate a prompt return to coagulation homeostasis in this subjectsPlasma cytokine bead array analysis Finally soluble mediator circulate cytokine chemokine and growth factor be measure in BDBVinfected macaque plasma sample ILÎ² level be high in mild disease survivor early after infection suggest that innate immunity be briefly stimulate and then arrest in this cohort FigÂ A Severe disease and lethality be instead associate with copious increase in marker of innate immune function and inflammation that persist late into disease eg monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP IP IL IL IL and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF FigÂ B to E The expression of this proinflammatory mediator coincide with the onset of clinical disease similar to previous EBOV report high systemic increase in IL and antiinflammatory IL and IL receptor antagonist ILRA mediator be also observe in fatal subject The Th cytokine IL be much abundantly express in survivor in early to middlestage disease which coincide with our enrichment finding indicate activation of both Th and Th pathway Additionally ILRA be express at high level in survivor at the early disease stage this result indicate that rapid resolution of inflammation be accomplish in survivor with mild disease DISCUSSION The continue reemergence of ebolaviruses emphasize the need for the development of effective countermeasure against this virus â Historically effort to develop intervention have be hamper in part by the dearth of clinical and laboratory research explore the pathophysiology of EVD Moreover clinical sample typically provide only glimpse into the host response as repeat sample be uncommon Prognostic indicator comprise factor that promote or hinder defense against ebolaviruses particularly BDBV thus remain incompletely define The reduce lethality of BDBV in NHP model â result in a pool of survivor afford us the unique opportunity of identify immune correlate that confer protection against ebolaviruses NHPs be consider the gold standard animal model as they much accurately recapitulate human EVD We compare viral load clinical sign and host response in BDBVinfected rhesus macaque Surprisingly there be no significant difference between peak viral RNA titer in fatal and survivor macaque but there be a significant difference in infectious titer This find may reflect comparable initial dissemination of the virus in each cohort but the inability to remove infect cell and terminate the immune response in fatal case Immunological control whether mediate by innate or adaptive response be thus likely responsible for infectious virus clearance in survivor All animal display various degree of illness along with hematological change Disease severity and fatal outcome correspond with live dysfunction lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy disseminate intravascular coagulation DIC be a hallmark feature of EVD and be characterize by hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade consequence of DIC include hemorrhagic diathesis due to consumption of platelet and clot factor as good as widespread deposition of fibrin clot thrombus that become trap in small blood vessel result in ischemia hemolytic anemia erythrocyte be fragment during transport through narrow microvasculature and occasionally organ failure One key event that trigger this EVD phenomenon be oversecretion of tissue factor by monocyte and macrophage Another mechanism involve increase level of plasminogen activator inhibitor I PAII in response to mark increase in cytokine andor circulate lp The thrombosisassociated marker PAI and tissue plasminogen activator tPA be elevate in fatal macaque and survivor exhibit severe illness after BDBV exposure suggest that this factor may also play a role in DIC high PAI level be also find in pediatric patient infect with Sudan ebolavirus and fatal human case of Lassa virus disease suggest that this marker may represent a universal feature among hemorrhagic fever virus infection PAI be a serine protease inhibitor serpin that normally function as a inhibitor of plasminogen activator like tPA and urokinase In that sense PAI halt whereas tPA promote fibrinolysis While both PAI and tPA be elevate among fatal macaque and survivor with severe disease exceptionally high level of tPA may enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis allude to the complexity of fibrinolysis homeostasis Coagulation change that mimic DIC may also play a role in the severity of coronavirus disease COVID A recent paper reveal that elevation of tPA and PAI be significantly associate with mortality in COVID patient A strong correlation be find between tPAPAI concentration and both absolute neutrophil count and systemic calprotectin SASA heterodimer level Our result indicate that severe and fatal disease also correspond with granulocytosis and monocytosis Neutrophil granulocyte be spare from EBOV infection but their degranulation proinflammatory secretion neutrophil extracellular trap NET formation and reactive oxygen species ROS production can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage In vitro and in vivo EBOV readily infect monocyte and macrophage lead to their activation and result in massive cytokine chemokine and growth factor secretion â Our study and other have show that monocyte be the major cell target for EBOV in vivo and constitute a significant proportion of transcriptional change in blood cell from infect macaque this study support the notion that monocyte andor neutrophil be strongly implicate in EVD pathophysiology Our analysis indicate that a fatal outcome be associate with MDSCrelated transcriptional signature eg SA SA PTGS CEBPB LILRA and CXCR MDSCs be pathologically activate monocyte and neutrophil with potent immunosuppressive activity The morphological and physiological resemblance of MDSCs to conventional monocyte and granulocyte make it difficult to distinguish between this cell type To far complicate matter base on their theorize granulocytic or monocytic lineage two MDSC subset exist granulocyticpolymorphonuclear MDSC PMNMDSC and monocytic MDSC MMDSC each with distinct cellular profile and mechanism of immunosuppression Whereas classical activation of myeloid cell be drive primarily by pattern recognition receptor PRRs and quickly subside after clearance of the stimulus pathological activation arise from a persistent environment of growth factor granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor GMCSF and macrophage colonystimulating factor MCSF chemokine CCL MCP and inflammatory signal IL beta IL VEGF IL HIFalpha and adenosine in the absence of pathogen clearance In the present study the expression of many of this polarize factor be associate with disease severity or fatal outcome follow BDBV exposure Great effort have be put forth in recent year to define the genomic proteomic and metabolic signature of MDSCs give their implication in numerous pathological condition include sepsis cancer chronic infection and various autoimmune disorder eg type diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Our result show increase transcript map to SLE in TB cell signal pathway in the fatal datum set imply that EVD and SLE may share certain pathological feature Other support evidence for the role of MDSC in filovirus pathogenesis be report of a accumulation of lowdensity neutrophil in human or NHPs infect with EBOV PMNMDSCs have a low density than conventional neutrophil enable them to fractionate with the peripheral blood mononuclear PBMC interface in density gradient blood preparation Moreover our group and other have identify rapidly expand monocytelike population that express low level of MHCII molecule a define feature of MMDSCs One caveat of our study be that we do not perform flow cytometry or singlecell RNA sequence scRNASeq to determine whether MDSCs be indeed recruit and contribute to the bulk DE transcript identify However our previous transcriptional analysis of purify monocyte from infect macaque support monocyte as major contributor of gene expression change in peripheral cell that express high level of MDSCrelated transcript include many that we have identify in this study much recently comprehensive scRNASeq along with highdimensional flow cytometry confirm that monocytelike cell from EBOVinfected rhesus macaque express high level of SASA and downregulate multiple MHCIIrelated molecule The author of this study suggest this cell may represent immature monocyte or bone marrow monocyte precursor release during emergency myelopoiesis Importantly future study should test whether this cell represent bona fide MDSCs by assess their ability to suppress the adaptive immune response via ex vivo functional assay MMDSCs can suppress T cell activity by secrete nitric oxide NO and immunosuppressive cytokine IL and transform growth factor beta TGFÎ² or express immune regulatory molecule PDL PMNMDSCs preferentially exploit ROS prostaglandin peroxynitrite and arginase to mediate immune suppression macrophage that be differentiate from MMDSCs but not monocyte be immunosuppressive and share similar genomic profile Kwak et al demonstrate that the immunosuppressive activity of MMDSCderived macrophage be dependent on prolong expression of SA protein in this cell and involve the transcription factor CEBPÎ² The author also demonstrate that SA promote be polarization of macrophage In contrast to be macrophage which participate in pathogen kill be alternatively activate macrophage be generally antiinflammatory Therefore this cell can promote a environment that enhance viral replication or downregulates the adaptive immune response McElroy et al show substantial immunoreactivity of the Maffiliated marker CD in association with viral antigen in the tissue of human fatal case This marker be associate with both disease severity and fatal outcome Our result also indicate high expression of CD in fatal subject as good as abundant tingible body macrophage in lymphoid tissue far support that Mlike macrophage contribute to ebolavirus pathogenesis Tingible body macrophage be think to downregulate the germinal center reaction by release prostaglandin and inhibit IL production which may contribute to the lack of adaptive response Disruption of the B cellrich marginal zone within the germinal center architecture in lymphoid tissue may exacerbate this condition as this find be prominent in fatal case in our study Conversely germinal center be intact in survive animal with the absence of a accumulation of tingible body macrophage analysis of DE transcript demonstrate that survivor also express much transcript enrich to B cell antigen receptor signal CDB and CDA Previous study have show that downregulation of CDA be observe in B cell during acute disease follow exposure of rhesus macaque to EBOV which may serve as a virus mechanism to impede B cell activation and generation of memory B cell Indeed low predict frequency of IgM and IgG memory B cell neutralize titer and transcriptionally derive plasma cell quantity be detect in fatal macaque In contrast estimate increase in this B cell subset be observe in survivor along with high ELISA titer of BDBVspecific IgM and IgG antibody and neutralize titer transcript map to numerous cellular immunity and humoral immunityrelated pathway include ICOS signal in T helper cell calciuminduced T lymphocyte apoptosis PKCÎ¸ signal and CD signal in T helper Th cell be also high in survivor than in fatal datum set Although lymphocyte activation signal be find in fatal case this transcriptional response appear nonspecific rather than a result of antigendependent T and B cell activation and be possibly cytokine mediate Therefore both antigenspecific humoral and cellular immunity be likely pivotal for protection against EVD In summary we identify potential biomarker that predict EVD disease severity and lethality sustain activation of innate immunity MDSCrelated signal and dysregulation of fibrinolytic pathway be prominent finding in fatal case survivor express T cell and B cellrelated transcript and other mRNAs map to adaptive immune pathway signify that both cellular and humoral immunity be critical for protection against EVD Elucidation of the mechanism that confer lethality or defense against ebolaviruses can be harness to develop diagnostics or immunomodulatory therapy for this deadly pathogensMATERIALS AND method ethic statement Animal study be perform

IMPORTANCE Bundibugyo virus BDBV and Ebola virus EBOV be ebolaviruses endemic to Africa that cause severe often fatal hemorrhagic disease BDBV be consider a little pathogenic ebolavirus due to its reduce lethality during human outbreak as good as in experimentally infect nonhuman primate The reduce mortality of BDBV in NHP model result in a pool of survivor afford us the unique opportunity of identify immune correlate that confer protection against ebolaviruses In this study we discover that the survival of BDBVinfected nonhuman primate NHPs be dependent on early development of adaptive memory immune response and reduce myeloidderived suppressor cell MDSCrelated signal MDSCs be a heterogenous group of immune cell implicate in a numb of disease that be powerful immunosuppressors of cellular and humoral immunity Thus MDSCs represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent ebolavirus disease To our knowledge this be the first study to link increase morbidity with recruitment of this potent immunosuppressive cell INTRODUCTION The Ebolavirus genus comprise six species Zaire ebolavirus Bundibugyo ebolavirus Sudan ebolavirus Tai Forest ebolavirus Reston ebolavirus and the recently discover Bombali ebolavirus The ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus EBOV species Zaire ebolavirus in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea demonstrate that ebolaviruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health Clinical manifestation of ebolavirusinfected human and nonhuman primate NHPs be similar include high viremia hypercytokinemia and consumptive coagulopathy which may progress to septic shock and multiorgan failure The virus initially replicate in monocyte and dendritic cell and then spread to hepatocyte endothelial cell and epithelial cell Bundibugyo virus BDBV species Bundibugyo ebolavirus be consider a little pathogenic ebolavirus due to its reduce lethality during human outbreak to as good as in experimentally infect cynomolgus and rhesus macaque â In contrast infection of NHPs with EBOV result in nearly uniform lethality While indepth transcriptome analysis have be perform on sample from EBOVinfected human patient and NHPs no such study exist for BDBV â As macaque be incompletely protect against BDBV disease we reason that this experimental model can aid in the identification of specific immune cell population and transcriptional correlate that support natural defense In this study longitudinal whole blood sample be collect from BDBVinfected rhesus macaque Clinical pathology viral load and plasma level of cytokine chemokine and thrombosis marker be assess in survive and nonsurviving animal refer to as survivor and fatal subject respectively Transcriptional change in each datum set be compare at early middle and late time point after infection to define the immune response at each stage of disease Humoral response be measure with BDBV glycoprotein GPspecific IgM and IgG enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISAs and plaque reduction neutralization test PRNTs this analysis characterize the systemic host response to BDBV exposure Here we demonstrate that early cellular and humoral immune response contribute to survival whereas prolong innate immune signal coagulation anomaly and myeloidderived suppressor cellassociated signal be associate with severe or fatal diseaseRESULTS Experimental infection of rhesus macaque Ten adult rhesus macaque be intramuscularly im inoculate with a PFU target dose of BDBV The survival rate of macaque up to the daypostinfection dpi study endpoint be â¼ of animal FigÂ A Of the four fatal case one animal succumb at dpi two animal succumb at dpi and one animal succumb at dpi Two survivor survivor and survivor have clinical score of â¥ at to dpi but their condition rapidly improve by dpi FigÂ B All BDBVinfected macaque develop various degree of illness include fever anorexia macular rash andor depression TableÂ Disease manifestation in the fatal cohort be generally much severe All infect macaque develop fever except fatal and survivor and all animal except survivor experience anorexia Three of four fatal subject develop a mild petechial rash one exhibit facial edema three have diarrhea and one animal show sign of neurological disease fatal In the survivor cohort three of five survivor suffer mild petechial rash and one subject present with emesis and mild dehydration survivor Hematological or serum biochemistry change be evident in all BDBVinfected macaque Fatality correlate with the onset of thrombocytopenia lymphopenia and granulocytosis although this cell population change be also transiently observe in some survivor All animal except survivor have elevate level of live enzyme include alanine aminotransferase ALT aspartate aminotransferase AST alkaline phosphatase ALP and gammaglutamyltransferase GGT increase blood urea nitrogen BUN andor creatinine CRE concentration be prominent in the serum of fatal case and two survivor point to potential kidney damage Creactive protein CRP level be also increase in all fatal case and four survivor indicate systemic inflammation circulate viral load in the plasma of infect macaque We assess the level of viremia in each cohort by perform reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR RTqPCR amplification of viral genomic RNA and conventional plaque assay on whole blood sample All infect animal be PCR positive FigÂ C and TableÂ Average peak PCR titer be Â± log copiesml mean Â± standard error of the mean SEM for fatal case whereas the mean titer for survivor be Â± log copiesml Interestingly the peak viral RNA titer be not significantly different between survive and nonsurviving subject MannWhitney nonparametric twotailed t test Pââ However the average peak infectious viral load be significantly different between the two group MannWhitney nonparametric twotailed t test Pââ with titer of Â± and Â± log PFUml for nonsurviving and survive subject respectively FigÂ have and TableÂ Infectious virus be never detect in survivor at the time point test but this animal have detectable viral RNA on day log copiesml and log copiesml TableÂ The high PCR titer and absence of detectable infectious virus in this animal may indicate rapid clearance of viable virus with noninfectious virus component persist in the blood Viremia be reduce or absent in of fatal subject at endstage disease suggest immunemediated rather than virusinduced pathology Finally no ostensible trend between nonsurviving and survive mild or severe subject be apparent for viral RNA FigÂ E or infectious virus FigÂ F load over the course of the studyHistopathology and immunohistochemistry macaque within the fatal cohort display at less one or much histologic lesion consistent with ebolavirus disease EVD include histiocytosis and lymphocytolysis within multiple lymph node axillary and inguinal multifocal necrotizing hepatitis lymphohistocytic interstitial nephritis and hemorrhagic necrotizing adrenalitis FigÂ Other feature include lymphohistocytic interstitial pneumonia and lymphocytic perivascular cuff with multifocal glial nodule within the brain Diffuse cytoplasmic immunohistochemistry IHC label for antiBDBV GP antigen be note in association with the aforementioned lesion FigÂ IHCpositive cell include mononuclear cell scatter within the follow region sinus of the lymph node axillary and inguinal sinusoid of the live Kupffer cell renal interstitium adrenal medulla alveolar septate and alveolus of the lung alveolar macrophage Infrequently antigenpositive cell include individual hepatocyte glomerular tuft in the kidney cluster of cell within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex endothelium and cell within the glial nodule of the brain The spleen of all macaque within the fatal cohort have diminish marginal zone with relative spare of both the mantle zone and periarteriolar sheath pal In the much severe lesion distinct zone be indiscernible admix with hemorrhage and numerous tingible body macrophage The condition of the red pulp among the fatal cohort range from congestion to mark fibrin deposition that infiltrate the disorder marginal zone Interestingly the brainstem of one survivor survivor have a focal glial nodule and multifocal cluster lymphocytic perivascular cuff associate positive IHC label of mononuclear cell within the nodule and ependymal cell of the choroid plexus be find No other lesion or positive IHC label for BDBV antigen be observe in this survivor The remain five survivor survivor survivor survivor survivor and survivor lack significant lesion or IHC label for BDBV antigen in the tissue section examinedTargeted transcriptome profile of BDBVinfected macaque To identify transcriptional correlate of protection we compare immunonomes in fatal and survivor whole blood RNA as previously describe sample be analyze for each subject at early to dpi middle to dpi and late to dpi in survivor or the terminal time point in fatal subject disease stage TableÂ S in the supplemental material This normalization strategy be typical for human and nonhuman primate transcriptomic study â on

under the term of the Creative common Attribution International licenseExamination of normalize sample by principalcomponent analysis PCA reveal that sample from fatal subject and survivor with severe illness subject with a peak clinical score of â¥ cluster together denote similar transcriptional profile FigÂ A Hence survivor with severe disease be group separately from survivor with mildtomoderate disease for our subsequent analysis Dimensional separation be observe for the disease stage covariate as evidence by distinct cluster of early middle and latestage sample At the early stage of disease we identify differentially express DE transcript with a false discovery rate FDRadjusted P value of in sample from survivor with mildtomoderate versus fatal disease see datum Set S in the supplemental material The much significant DE mRNAs filter by each disease stage be illustrate in FigÂ B much notably survivor with mild disease have a â¼logfold reduction in the expression of SA and SA early after infection whereas survivor with severe disease exhibit a â¼logfold reduction this mRNAs encode calciumbinding protein that form a heterodimer calprotectin and be consider hallmark marker of myeloidderived suppressor cell MDSCs Repression of other MDSCrelated transcript eg PTGS CEBPB CXCR and LILRA along with the be macrophage activation marker CD be also note Nevertheless some of this molecule be transiently express in the severe disease survivor group suggest that disease severity may be link to recruitment of this potent immunosuppressors To test this hypothesis we compare disease score and MDSCrelated transcript Positive correlation be find between SA Pearson Pââ and SA Pearson Pââ count and clinical score at middle and late disease stage FigÂ C

visualization of network datum with the density of gene cluster interaction and node represent signal intensity Survivor signature predominantly enrich to adaptive immunity network include lymphocyte activation BCR regulation and alphabeta T cell activation FigÂ E In the fatal cohort transcript primarily enrich to gene cluster involve in innate immunity such as myeloid cell activation leukocyte migration Tolllike receptor TLR cascade and IL signal In contrast adaptive immunityrelated node be minimally apparent To validate this finding we also perform functional enrichment use IPA which take both positive and negative regulator into account for predict activation or inhibition of each genesignaling network In line with our DE and Metascape result positive zscores in survivor correlate

FigÂ F pathway with negative zscores include that relate to hypercytokinemiahyperchemokinemia pattern recognition receptor sense NK cell signal and autoimmunity eg systemic lupus erythematosus SLE in TB cell signal pathway Together this result suggest that BDBV lethality be associate with prolong innate signal and minimal or dysregulated adaptive response Next to capture shift in circulate cell population we use nSolverbased immune cell type profile FigÂ A In agreement with our DE analysis and enrichment result this feature predict that DE mRNAs in survivor with mild disease be associate with increase quantity of T helper cell cytotoxic T cell and B cell type frequency of B cell early after infection be estimate to wane in survivor exhibit severe disease Neutrophil and macrophage population be predict to expand in fatal case support our hematology and histopathology result For a much granular assessment we also perform digital cell quantification DCQ use CIBERSORT to estimate cell type abundance of various B and T cell subset FigÂ B At the early disease stage memory B cell and follicular helper T cell be increase in the mild survivor group whereas CD T cell and memory T cell be increase in the severe survivor group At middle and late disease stage both survivor group have high quantity of plasma cell and CD T cell type than the fatal cohort this datum suggest that both humoral and cellular response be critical for survival against BDBVAssessment of humoral response As our DCQ prediction suggest that survival correlate with recruitment of plasma cell we perform antiglycoprotein antiGP IgG FigÂ A and IgM FigÂ B enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISAs on serum sample collect from each subject survivor form BDBV GPspecific IgM and IgG with both immunoglobulin class appear at the middle stage of disease At the late stage of disease the antibody titer of survivor with severe disease range from to for IgG and to for IgM whereas the titer in survivor with mild disease range from to for IgG and to for IgM Conversely only low IgM and IgG to titer be note in fatal subject For the survive subject survivor with only viral RNA detectable and not infectious virus load we observe moderate to high IgM and IgG titer TableÂ S Unlike the immunoglobulin level in the fatal group the IgM titer in the survivor cohort generally decline during the late disease stage conjointly with increase moderate to high titer of IgG FigÂ A and B Plaque reduction neutralization test indicate that survivor have high albeit overall low level of neutralize antibody at middle and latestage disease FigÂ C Measurement of thrombosisassociated marker As EVD be know to induce disseminate intravascular coagulation the concentration of various thrombosisassociated marker be measure use a cytokine bead array at each disease stage elevate level of tissue plasminogen activator tPA FigÂ have and plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI FigÂ E be find in fatal macaque and survivor with severe disease at middle and late disease stage although decline in this marker be see in the severe survivor cohort at the latter time point Interestingly tPA and soluble CD ligand sCDL level be significantly different in the mild survivor group only at the early disease stage FigÂ have and F this result indicate a prompt return to coagulation homeostasis in this subjectsPlasma cytokine bead array analysis Finally soluble mediator circulate cytokine chemokine and growth factor be measure in BDBVinfected macaque plasma sample ILÎ² level be high in mild disease survivor early after infection suggest that innate immunity be briefly stimulate and then arrest in this cohort FigÂ A Severe disease and lethality be instead associate with copious increase in marker of innate immune function and inflammation that persist late into disease eg monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP IP IL IL IL and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF FigÂ B to E The expression of this proinflammatory mediator coincide with the onset of clinical disease similar to previous EBOV report high systemic increase in IL and antiinflammatory IL and IL receptor antagonist ILRA mediator be also observe in fatal subject The Th cytokine IL be much abundantly express in survivor in early to middlestage disease which coincide with our enrichment finding indicate activation of both Th and Th pathway Additionally ILRA be express at high level in survivor at the early disease stage this result indicate that rapid resolution of inflammation be accomplish in survivor with mild disease DISCUSSION The continue reemergence of ebolaviruses emphasize the need for the development of effective countermeasure against this virus â Historically effort to develop intervention have be hamper in part by the dearth of clinical and laboratory research explore the pathophysiology of EVD Moreover clinical sample typically provide only glimpse into the host response as repeat sample be uncommon Prognostic indicator comprise factor that promote or hinder defense against ebolaviruses particularly BDBV thus remain incompletely define The reduce lethality of BDBV in NHP model â result in a pool of survivor afford us the unique opportunity of identify immune correlate that confer protection against ebolaviruses NHPs be consider the gold standard animal model as they much accurately recapitulate human EVD We compare viral load clinical sign and host response in BDBVinfected rhesus macaque Surprisingly there be no significant difference between peak viral RNA titer in fatal and survivor macaque but there be a significant difference in infectious titer This find may reflect comparable initial dissemination of the virus in each cohort but the inability to remove infect cell and terminate the immune response in fatal case Immunological control whether mediate by innate or adaptive response be thus likely responsible for infectious virus clearance in survivor All animal display various degree of illness along with hematological change Disease severity and fatal outcome correspond with live dysfunction lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy disseminate intravascular coagulation DIC be a hallmark feature of EVD and be characterize by hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade consequence of DIC include hemorrhagic diathesis due to consumption of platelet and clot factor as good as widespread deposition of fibrin clot thrombus that become trap in small blood vessel result in ischemia hemolytic anemia erythrocyte be fragment during transport through narrow microvasculature and occasionally organ failure One key event that trigger this EVD phenomenon be oversecretion of tissue factor by monocyte and macrophage Another mechanism involve increase level of plasminogen activator inhibitor I PAII in response to mark increase in cytokine andor circulate lp The thrombosisassociated marker PAI and tissue plasminogen activator tPA be elevate in fatal macaque and survivor exhibit severe illness after BDBV exposure suggest that this factor may also play a role in DIC high PAI level be also find in pediatric patient infect with Sudan ebolavirus and fatal human case of Lassa virus disease suggest that this marker may represent a universal feature among hemorrhagic fever virus infection PAI be a serine protease inhibitor serpin that normally function as a inhibitor of plasminogen activator like tPA and urokinase In that sense PAI halt whereas tPA promote fibrinolysis While both PAI and tPA be elevate among fatal macaque and survivor with severe disease exceptionally high level of tPA may enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis allude to the complexity of fibrinolysis homeostasis Coagulation change that mimic DIC may also play a role in the severity of coronavirus disease COVID A recent paper reveal that elevation of tPA and PAI be significantly associate with mortality in COVID patient A strong correlation be find between tPAPAI concentration and both absolute neutrophil count and systemic calprotectin SASA heterodimer level Our result indicate that severe and fatal disease also correspond with granulocytosis and monocytosis Neutrophil granulocyte be spare from EBOV infection but their degranulation proinflammatory secretion neutrophil extracellular trap NET formation and reactive oxygen species ROS production can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage In vitro and in vivo EBOV readily infect monocyte and macrophage lead to their activation and result in massive cytokine chemokine and growth factor secretion â Our study and other have show that monocyte be the major cell target for EBOV in vivo and constitute a significant proportion of transcriptional change in blood cell from infect macaque this study support the notion that monocyte andor neutrophil be strongly implicate in EVD pathophysiology Our analysis indicate that a fatal outcome be associate with MDSCrelated transcriptional signature eg SA SA PTGS CEBPB LILRA and CXCR MDSCs be pathologically activate monocyte and neutrophil with potent immunosuppressive activity The morphological and physiological resemblance of MDSCs to conventional monocyte and granulocyte make it difficult to distinguish between this cell type To far complicate matter base on their theorize granulocytic or monocytic lineage two MDSC subset exist granulocyticpolymorphonuclear MDSC PMNMDSC and monocytic MDSC MMDSC each with distinct cellular profile and mechanism of immunosuppression Whereas classical activation of myeloid cell be drive primarily by pattern recognition receptor PRRs and quickly subside after clearance of the stimulus pathological activation arise from a persistent environment of growth factor granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor GMCSF and macrophage colonystimulating factor MCSF chemokine CCL MCP and inflammatory signal IL beta IL VEGF IL HIFalpha and adenosine in the absence of pathogen clearance In the present study the expression of many of this polarize factor be associate with disease severity or fatal outcome follow BDBV exposure Great effort have be put forth in recent year to define the genomic proteomic and metabolic signature of MDSCs give their implication in numerous pathological condition include sepsis cancer chronic infection and various autoimmune disorder eg type diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Our result show increase transcript map to SLE in TB cell signal pathway in the fatal datum set imply that EVD and SLE may share certain pathological feature Other support evidence for the role of MDSC in filovirus pathogenesis be report of a accumulation of lowdensity neutrophil in human or NHPs infect with EBOV PMNMDSCs have a low density than conventional neutrophil enable them to fractionate with the peripheral blood mononuclear PBMC interface in density gradient blood preparation Moreover our group and other have identify rapidly expand monocytelike population that express low level of MHCII molecule a define feature of MMDSCs One caveat of our study be that we do not perform flow cytometry or singlecell RNA sequence scRNASeq to determine whether MDSCs be indeed recruit and contribute to the bulk DE transcript identify However our previous transcriptional analysis of purify monocyte from infect macaque support monocyte as major contributor of gene expression change in peripheral cell that express high level of MDSCrelated transcript include many that we have identify in this study much recently comprehensive scRNASeq along with highdimensional flow cytometry confirm that monocytelike cell from EBOVinfected rhesus macaque express high level of SASA and downregulate multiple MHCIIrelated molecule The author of this study suggest this cell may represent immature monocyte or bone marrow monocyte precursor release during emergency myelopoiesis Importantly future study should test whether this cell represent bona fide MDSCs by assess their ability to suppress the adaptive immune response via ex vivo functional assay MMDSCs can suppress T cell activity by secrete nitric oxide NO and immunosuppressive cytokine IL and transform growth factor beta TGFÎ² or express immune regulatory molecule PDL PMNMDSCs preferentially exploit ROS prostaglandin peroxynitrite and arginase to mediate immune suppression macrophage that be differentiate from MMDSCs but not monocyte be immunosuppressive and share similar genomic profile Kwak et al demonstrate that the immunosuppressive activity of MMDSCderived macrophage be dependent on prolong expression of SA protein in this cell and involve the transcription factor CEBPÎ² The author also demonstrate that SA promote be polarization of macrophage In contrast to be macrophage which participate in pathogen kill be alternatively activate macrophage be generally antiinflammatory Therefore this cell can promote a environment that enhance viral replication or downregulates the adaptive immune response McElroy et al show substantial immunoreactivity of the Maffiliated marker CD in association with viral antigen in the tissue of human fatal case This marker be associate with both disease severity and fatal outcome Our result also indicate high expression of CD in fatal subject as good as abundant tingible body macrophage in lymphoid tissue far support that Mlike macrophage contribute to ebolavirus pathogenesis Tingible body macrophage be think to downregulate the germinal center reaction by release prostaglandin and inhibit IL production which may contribute to the lack of adaptive response Disruption of the B cellrich marginal zone within the germinal center architecture in lymphoid tissue may exacerbate this condition as this find be prominent in fatal case in our study Conversely germinal center be intact in survive animal with the absence of a accumulation of tingible body macrophage analysis of DE transcript demonstrate that survivor also express much transcript enrich to B cell antigen receptor signal CDB and CDA Previous study have show that downregulation of CDA be observe in B cell during acute disease follow exposure of rhesus macaque to EBOV which may serve as a virus mechanism to impede B cell activation and generation of memory B cell Indeed low predict frequency of IgM and IgG memory B cell neutralize titer and transcriptionally derive plasma cell quantity be detect in fatal macaque In contrast estimate increase in this B cell subset be observe in survivor along with high ELISA titer of BDBVspecific IgM and IgG antibody and neutralize titer transcript map to numerous cellular immunity and humoral immunityrelated pathway include ICOS signal in T helper cell calciuminduced T lymphocyte apoptosis PKCÎ¸ signal and CD signal in T helper Th cell be also high in survivor than in fatal datum set Although lymphocyte activation signal be find in fatal case this transcriptional response appear nonspecific rather than a result of antigendependent T and B cell activation and be possibly cytokine mediate Therefore both antigenspecific humoral and cellular immunity be likely pivotal for protection against EVD In summary we identify potential biomarker that predict EVD disease severity and lethality sustain activation of innate immunity MDSCrelated signal and dysregulation of fibrinolytic pathway be prominent finding in fatal case survivor express T cell and B cellrelated transcript and other mRNAs map to adaptive immune pathway signify that both cellular and humoral immunity be critical for protection against EVD Elucidation of the mechanism that confer lethality or defense against ebolaviruses can be harness to develop diagnostics or

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00974-20","Rhizobia be ecologically important facultative plantsymbiotic microbe In nature there be a large variability in the association of rhizobial strain and host plant of the same species Here we evaluate whether plant and rhizobial genotype influence the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium follow perception of a host plant RNA sequence of the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti expose to root exudate or luteolin a inducer of nod gene involve in the early step of symbiotic interaction be perform on a combination of three S meliloti strain and three alfalfa variety as host plant The response to root exudate involve hundred of change in the rhizobium transcriptome Of the differentially express gene be influence by the strain genotype be influence by the plant genotype and be influence by strainbyhost plant genotype interaction We also examine the response of a hybrid S meliloti strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid â¼ of the genome be mobilize between two of the abovementioned strain dozen of gene be upregulated in the hybrid strain indicative of nonadditive variation in the transcriptome In conclusion this study demonstrate that transcriptional response of rhizobia upon perception of legume be influence by the genotype of both symbiotic partner and their interaction suggest a wide spectrum of genetic determinant involve in the phenotypic variation of plantrhizobium symbiosis INTRODUCTION microbe play a crucial role in the biology and evolution of their eukaryotic host Among other activity microbe contribute to the hostâs acquisition of nutrient function of the hostâs immune system and protection of the host from predation The rule govern hostmicrobe interaction remain a topic of intense investigation In many case the eukaryotic host selectively recruit the desire microbial partner squid light organ be selectively colonize by Vibrio symbiont legume select for effective symbiont by sanction noneffective symbiont and the crop microbiome be cultivar dependent The genetic basis determine the quality of a microbial symbiont ie its ability to improve host plant phenotype such as growth and tolerance and its ability to effectively colonize its eukaryotic partner be generally not good understand but evolution experiment and highthroughput genome sequence project of hostassociated microbe and complete microbiomes be shed light on this topic â In the case of plant such study have observe a enrichment of certain gene function in plantassociated microbe such as gene relate to carbohydrate metabolism secretion system phytohormone production and phosphorus solubilization The rhizobia be a ecologically important exemplar of facultative hostassociated microbe this soildwelling bacterium be able to colonize plant and enter a endosymbiotic association with plant of the family Fabaceae This developmentally complex process begin with a exchange of signal between the freeliving organism which lead to the invasion of the plant by the rhizobia and culminate in the formation of a new organ a nodule in which the plant cell be intracellularly colonize by Nfixing rhizobia decade of research have identify a intricate network of coordinate gene function require to establish a successful mutualistic interaction between rhizobia and legume â In contrast to the core symbiotic machinery much of which have be elucidate much remain unknown about the accessory gene require to optimize the interaction In addition to simple gene presenceabsence genotypebygenotype GxG interaction have prominent impact on symbiotic outcome The importance of both the plant and bacterial genotype and their interaction in optimize symbiosis between rhizobia and legume be recognize in early population genetic study â much recently greenhouse study have directly demonstrate the influence of GxG interaction on the fitness of both the plant and rhizobium partner â The newly develop selectandresequence approach be provide a highthroughput approach to uncover the genetic basis underlie GxG interaction for fitness in rhizobiumlegume symbiosis as good as a way to screen for strainspecific effect of individual gene To date GxG interaction study have largely focus on measurement of fitness as a holistic measure of the entire symbiotic process Nodule formation be a complex developmental process involve several step each of which require a distinct molecular toolkit and in principle distinct GxG interaction can be act at each of this developmental stage Transcriptomic study have demonstrate that GxG interaction have significant impact on the gene expression pattern of both partner in mature Nfixing nodule However we be unaware of study specifically focus on the role of GxG interaction in early developmental stage such as during the initial perception of the partner by each other Such knowledge be critical not only to fully understand the microevolution of hostassociated bacterium but also to develop host varietyspecific rhizobium bioinoculants that may ensure good nodulation ability over unwanted indigenous rhizobial strain Here we evaluate whether GxG interaction can be identify in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant We work with Sinorhizobium meliloti which be one of the beststudied model for GxG interaction in rhizobia S meliloti form Nfixing nodule on plant belong to the tribe Trigonelleae which include alfalfa a major forage crop grow worldwide for which many variety have be develop The S meliloti genome comprise three main replicons a chromosome a chromid and a megaplasmid the latter one harbor much of the essential symbiotic function include the gene responsible for the initial molecular dialog with the host plant nod gene To address our aim the gene expression pattern of three strain of S meliloti each with distinct symbiotic property follow h of exposure to root exudate derive from three alfalfa cultivate variety be characterize use RNA sequence RNAseq The transcriptome follow exposure to luteolin a know inducer of nod gene involve in the early step of symbiotic interaction be also analyze Additionally the relevance of the megaplasmid in define the strainspecific transcriptional response be analyze by study a hybrid S meliloti strain in which the native megaplasmid be replace with that of another wildtype strain The result demonstrate that the transcriptional response involve gene on all three replicons and that even among conserve S meliloti gene transcriptional pattern be both strain and root exudate specificRESULTS Symbiotic phenotype differ across rhizobial strainplant variety combination Symbiotic phenotype plant growth and nodule numb and root adhesion of S meliloti strain Rm BLC and AK be measure during interaction with three variety of alfalfa Camporegio Verbena and Lodi The result indicate that this phenotype be influence by both the plant and bacterial genotype FigÂ see also FigÂ S in the supplemental material Root adhesion phenotype FigÂ a be divide by the ScottKnott test into three main group reflect high medium and low root colonization Interestingly each group be heterogeneous with respect to both plant variety and S meliloti strain consistent with the specificity of plant variety ie genotype sensu lato and strain individuality ie strain genotype pair in root colonization efficiency For instance S meliloti BLC strongly colonize the root of the Camporegio and Verbena variety but it display much weak colonization of the Lodi cultivar On the other hand S meliloti AK colonize the Lodi and Camporegio variety good than the Verbena cultivar nodule per plant as good as measure of symbiotic efficiency epicotyl length and shoot spin-dry weight show difference among the strainvariety combination FigÂ b to have However the extent of the variation be low than that record for plant root adhesion The high numb of nodule be find on the Lodi variety nodulated by S meliloti AK which be previously interpret as a consequence of its reduce N fixation ability with some alfalfa variety â Interestingly the measure of symbiotic efficiency do not correlate with root adhesion phenotype both adhesion versus spin-dry weight and adhesion versus epicotyl length give nonsignificant Pearson correlation value P However we cannot a priori exclude that measure adhesion over the whole root may not reflect adhesion to the root hair extension zone where rhizobia start the symbiotic interaction

each experiment Nevertheless a core set of COG category be commonly over or underrepresent in all three S meliloti strain during exposure to the Camporegio or Verbena root exudate this include enrichment among the upregulated gene of COG category J and O relate to protein expression and modification suggest that the root exudate stimulate major remodel of the proteome In addition for upregulated gene COG category G carbohydrate transport and metabolism be underrepresent while for the downregulated gene COG category C energy production and conversion be overrepresented This observation suggest that the root exudate stimulate a global change in the cellular energy production pathway versus growth in our standard minimal medium with succinate as the sole carbon source A comparison with growth under soilmimicking condition would be interest with respect to interpret the root exudateinduced change in a ecological context Among the much highly express gene in S meliloti

AK datum Set S worksheet The induction of motility be in contrast to the observation that luteolin alone decrease the motility of the S meliloti Rm strain Presumably this reflect the presence of additional stimulus in the root exudate Indeed amino acid present in root exudate be know to stimulate chemotactic behavior in S meliloti and signaturetagged mutagenesis show that motilityrelated gene be relevant during competition for rhizosphere colonization by S meliloti Rm difference in the transcriptome of two Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens strain expose to root exudate be suggest to be relate to difference in their competitive ability We therefore examine the expression pattern of several gene likely to play a role in competition for rhizosphere colonization and root adhesion It be previously suggest that the sin quorum sense system be involve in competition in S meliloti in our datum sinI smc be repress in S meliloti Rm in the presence of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate but no change in the expression of the orthologous gene in strain AK or BLC be observe No evidence be find in any of the strain for change in the expression of galactoglucan or succinoglucan biosynthesis gene such as wgaA smb and wgeA smb The Verbena and Camporegio root exudate induce the expression of the rhizobactin transport gene sma rhtX of Rm and BLC this gene be not find in AK This may be a consequence of the root exudate chelate the available iron consequently elicit siderophore production that can inhibit the growth of strain lack siderophores Plasmid pSINME of S meliloti AK exhibit similarity with plasmid pHRC of S meliloti C which confer a competitive advantage for nodule occupancy and host range restriction consider that a few of the gene on the plasmid pSINME and pSINME be differentially express upon exposure to root exudate it be possible that the accessory plasmid of strain AK also contribute to competition for rhizosphere colonization difference in gene expression pattern across condition may be relate in part to difference in the presence of flavonoid In S meliloti it be know that root exudate contain flavone molecule activate the transcriptional regulator NodD which trigger the synthesis of Nod factor require for nodule formation To gain insight into the influence of NodD on the observe stimulons we compare the S meliloti Rm datum to that of the wellknown regulons of NodD require plant compound for its activation and NodD not require plant compound but rely on indirect activation through SyrM and NodD establish previously We find that out of the gene of the NodD regulon and be observe in the deg in response to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudate respectively Camporegio and Verbena root extract putatively contain apigenin while the Lodi root extract lack apigenin suggest a role of apigenin in the differential expression pattern observe For the gene of the NodD regulon and be find in the deg in response to the Verbena Camporegio and Lodi root exudate respectively The presence of a partial overlap of the know nod regulons â¼ or few of the deg under each condition suggest that much of the observe deg belong to nodindependent regulons Moreover some of this gene show contrast pattern of expression suggest that the root exudate may also contain antagonistic molecule that repress the nod regulon as previously report Mobilization of the symbiotic megaplasmid result in nonadditive change in stimulons To evaluate the impact of interreplicon epistatic interaction on the transcriptional response of S meliloti to alfalfa root exudate we use RNAseq to characterize the response of a previously construct S meliloti hybrid strain contain the symbiotic megaplasmid pSINMEB of strain BLC Cluster analysis clearly demonstrate that the transcriptome both global and restrict to pSymApSINMEB orthologs only of the hybrid strain differ from that of both the BLC and Rm wildtype strain under all condition FigÂ b FigÂ S Of particular interest be the result observe during exposure to the Lodi root exudate We previously show that alfalfa cv Lodi plant inoculate with the hybrid strain be large than that inoculate with either BLC or Rm Here we observe that exposure to the Lodi root exudate result in much differentially express gene in the hybrid strain gene than in either Rm or BLC and gene respectively TableÂ In particular a cluster of gene be specifically upregulated in the hybrid strain and the majority of this gene be locate on the symbiotic megaplasmid This peculiar feature of the Lodiinduced transcriptome in the hybrid strain be also highlight by the cluster analysis of pSymApSINMEB orthologs only in the hybrid strain do the Lodiinduced expression profile cluster with that of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate FigÂ b The presence of this possibly nonadditive transcriptional change may reflect a loss of cisregulation of this megaplasmid gene by chromosomal regulator

licenseDISCUSSION Rhizobiumlegume interaction be complex multistep phenomenon that begin with a exchange of signal between two partner The rhizobia initially detect the plant through the perception of flavonoid in the root exudate of legume by NodD protein which then trigger the production of lipochitooligosaccharide molecule know as Nod factor Nod factor be then recognize by specific LysM receptor kinase protein in plant root cell trigger the symbiosis signal pathway and initiate the formation of a nodule However root exudate contain a mixture of flavonoid some of them have different agonistic activity on NodD Root exudate also contain many other molecule that can serve as signal or support rhizobium metabolism such as amino acid and sugar that may influence the ability of rhizobia to successfully colonize the rhizosphere and be in a position to enter the symbiosis Consequently interaction between plant and rhizobium genotype be expect to influence the success of the initial interaction between the two partner Previous work have identify a clear role for GxG interaction in the partnership between S meliloti and Medicago truncatula demonstrate that aerial biomass be influence by the plant and rhizobium genotype as good as their interaction Here we demonstrate that GxG interaction also have a significant impact on the adherence of S meliloti strain to alfalfa root as a representative phenotype for a early stage of the interaction between this partner Rhizosphere colonization appear to have a direct impact on nodule colonization while our datum do not address if root adhesion be correlate with competition for nodule occupancy in mix inoculum they suggest that root adhesion be poorly correlate with overall symbiotic efficiency in singleinoculum study Previous study have demonstrate the influence of GxG interaction on the nodule transcriptome of MedicagoSinorhizobium symbiosis Here we show that GxG interaction similarly have a important contribution in determine the transcriptional response of S meliloti to the detection of Medicago sativa root exudate Together this result demonstrate that GxG interaction have a meaningful impact on the outcome of rhizobiumlegume symbiosis at multiple stage of development The exposure of B diazoefficiens to soybean root exudate result in change in the expression of gene represent nearly of the genome and the impact of soybean root exudate differ between the two test B diazoefficiens strain Similarly between and of S meliloti gene be differentially express follow exposure to alfalfa root exudate depend on the hostsymbiont combination The similaritiesdifferences in the response of the three S meliloti strain to treatment do not appear to depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the strain although this cannot be definitively conclude without analysis of additional strain Nevertheless this result emphasize the importance of transcriptional rewire during strain diversification in bacterium Similarly study with eukaryotic organism indicate that adaptation have a important role in differentiate the gene expression pattern of organism The root exudate stimulons only partially overlap the stimulons of luteolin a know inducer of NodD in S meliloti confirm that alfalfa root exudate contain numerous molecular signal aside from flavonoid that may influence the competitiveness of various rhizobium strain Importantly the transcriptional pattern induce by alfalfa root exudate differ depend on the cultivar from which they be collect whether this difference be adaptive require far investigation Additionally although root exudate metabolomic analysis be mainly descriptive and relatively few peak can be identify there be a similar pattern between the difference in the S meliloti gene expression profile and the overall chemical similarity of the root exudate as measure by LCMS the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate induce similar gene expression change while also be similar along the 2 principal component of variance account for of the variance in the PCA of the root exudate composition In future work it would be interest to define which compound in the root exudate have the great impact on the S meliloti transcriptome In addition to the impact of GxG interaction on rhizobiumlegume symbiosis there be the potential for interreplicon interaction within rhizobium genome to far influence the symbiosis Indeed interreplicon epistatic interaction be abundant in the S meliloti genome To address the contribution of interreplicon interaction to symbiosis we examine a hybrid strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid of S meliloti Rm a strain nearly identical to Rm be replace with the symbiotic megaplasmid of S meliloti BLC Nonadditive effect on the transcriptional profile associate with all three replicons be observe in the hybrid strain relative to Rm and BLC indicate that megaplasmid mobilization induce a global rewire of gene expression likely due to transcriptional cross talk among the replicons Similarly nonadditive effect on the transcriptome of plant hybrid have be extensively explore and demonstrate as one of the base for heterosis in crop In previous work look for regulatory module where the transcription factor and target gene reside on different replicons in S meliloti Rm we find transcriptional regulator encode by the chromosome or chromid with predict target gene on the megaplasmid Among that transcription factor system relate to exopolysaccharide production ExpG transport PcaQ and metabolism IolR and GlnBK be present support the hypothesis of a global rewire of gene expression network and a wide range of effect of this rewire The result with the hybrid lead us to hypothesize that the large symbiotic variability observe in natural S meliloti isolate may partly be relate to genomewide transcriptome change follow largescale horizontal gene transfer follow by natural selection Moreover we speculate that while the megaplasmid be the key element for a general response ie cultivar independent to speciesspecific host plant association the rhizobium chromosome and chromid finetune this response in a genotypedependent manner If true however this would limit our ability to predict the competitiveness of rhizobium isolate from their simple genome sequence instead a much complex understand of global regulatory network control would be require In conclusion this study demonstrate that the initial perception of legume by rhizobia lead to hundred of change in the rhizobium transcriptome and that this change be dependent on the plant genotype the rhizobium genotype and genotypebygenotype interaction this result complement previous study demonstrate the role of GxG interaction in determine the transcriptome of both the legume and rhizobium partner in mature Nfixing nodule The majority of gene upregulated in response to alfalfa root exudate be conserve in all three strain support the hypothesis that the S meliloti lineage be adapt to rhizosphere colonization before gain the gene require for symbiotic nitrogen fixation Additionally the transcriptional response to the perception of alfalfa root exudate involve gene from

sustainable way for meet the need of a increase global food demand should be base on a holobiont perspective view crop plant as intimately associate with their microbiome which help improve plant nutrition tolerance to pest and adverse climate condition However the genetic repertoire need for efficient association with plant by the microbial symbiont be still poorly understand The rhizobia be a exemplary model of facultative plant symbiotic microbe Here we evaluate whether genotypebygenotype interaction can be identify in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant We perform a RNA sequence study to analyze the transcriptome of different rhizobial strain elicit by root exudate of three alfalfa variety as a proxy of a early step of the symbiotic interaction The result indicate strain and plant varietydependent variability in the observe transcriptional change provide fundamentally novel insight into the genetic basis of rhizobiumplant interaction Our result provide genetic insight and perspective to aid in the exploitation of natural rhizobium variation for improvement of legume growth in agricultural ecosystem INTRODUCTION microbe play a crucial role in the biology and evolution of their eukaryotic host Among other activity microbe contribute to the hostâs acquisition of nutrient function of the hostâs immune system and protection of the host from predation The rule govern hostmicrobe interaction remain a topic of intense investigation In many case the eukaryotic host selectively recruit the desire microbial partner squid light organ be selectively colonize by Vibrio symbiont legume select for effective symbiont by sanction noneffective symbiont and the crop microbiome be cultivar dependent The genetic basis determine the quality of a microbial symbiont ie its ability to improve host plant phenotype such as growth and tolerance and its ability to effectively colonize its eukaryotic partner be generally not good understand but evolution experiment and highthroughput genome sequence project of hostassociated microbe and complete microbiomes be shed light on this topic â In the case of plant such study have observe a enrichment of certain gene function in plantassociated microbe such as gene relate to carbohydrate metabolism secretion system phytohormone production and phosphorus solubilization The rhizobia be a ecologically important exemplar of facultative hostassociated microbe this soildwelling bacterium be able to colonize plant and enter a endosymbiotic association with plant of the family Fabaceae This developmentally complex process begin with a exchange of signal between the freeliving organism which lead to the invasion of the plant by the rhizobia and culminate in the formation of a new organ a nodule in which the plant cell be intracellularly colonize by Nfixing rhizobia decade of research have identify a intricate network of coordinate gene function require to establish a successful mutualistic interaction between rhizobia and legume â In contrast to the core symbiotic machinery much of which have be elucidate much remain unknown about the accessory gene require to optimize the interaction In addition to simple gene presenceabsence genotypebygenotype GxG interaction have prominent impact on symbiotic outcome The importance of both the plant and bacterial genotype and their interaction in optimize symbiosis between rhizobia and legume be recognize in early population genetic study â much recently greenhouse study have directly demonstrate the influence of GxG interaction on the fitness of both the plant and rhizobium partner â The newly develop selectandresequence approach be provide a highthroughput approach to uncover the genetic basis underlie GxG interaction for fitness in rhizobiumlegume symbiosis as good as a way to screen for strainspecific effect of individual gene To date GxG interaction study have largely focus on measurement of fitness as a holistic measure of the entire symbiotic process Nodule formation be a complex developmental process involve several step each of which require a distinct molecular toolkit and in principle distinct GxG interaction can be act at each of this developmental stage Transcriptomic study have demonstrate that GxG interaction have significant impact on the gene expression pattern of both partner in mature Nfixing nodule However we be unaware of study specifically focus on the role of GxG interaction in early developmental stage such as during the initial perception of the partner by each other Such knowledge be critical not only to fully understand the microevolution of hostassociated bacterium but also to develop host varietyspecific rhizobium bioinoculants that may ensure good nodulation ability over unwanted indigenous rhizobial strain Here we evaluate whether GxG interaction can be identify in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant We work with Sinorhizobium meliloti which be one of the beststudied model for GxG interaction in rhizobia S meliloti form Nfixing nodule on plant belong to the tribe Trigonelleae which include alfalfa a major forage crop grow worldwide for which many variety have be develop The S meliloti genome comprise three main replicons a chromosome a chromid and a megaplasmid the latter one harbor much of the essential symbiotic function include the gene responsible for the initial molecular dialog with the host plant nod gene To address our aim the gene expression pattern of three strain of S meliloti each with distinct symbiotic property follow h of exposure to root exudate derive from three alfalfa cultivate variety be characterize use RNA sequence RNAseq The transcriptome follow exposure to luteolin a know inducer of nod gene involve in the early step of symbiotic interaction be also analyze Additionally the relevance of the megaplasmid in define the strainspecific transcriptional response be analyze by study a hybrid S meliloti strain in which the native megaplasmid be replace with that of another wildtype strain The result demonstrate that the transcriptional response involve gene on all three replicons and that even among conserve S meliloti gene transcriptional pattern be both strain and root exudate specificRESULTS Symbiotic phenotype differ across rhizobial strainplant variety combination Symbiotic phenotype plant growth and nodule numb and root adhesion of S meliloti strain Rm BLC and AK be measure during interaction with three variety of alfalfa Camporegio Verbena and Lodi The result indicate that this phenotype be influence by both the plant and bacterial genotype FigÂ see also FigÂ S in the supplemental material Root adhesion phenotype FigÂ a be divide by the ScottKnott test into three main group reflect high medium and low root colonization Interestingly each group be heterogeneous with respect to both plant variety and S meliloti strain consistent with the specificity of plant variety ie genotype sensu lato and strain individuality ie strain genotype pair in root colonization efficiency For instance S meliloti BLC strongly colonize the root of the Camporegio and Verbena variety but it display much weak colonization of the Lodi cultivar On the other hand S meliloti AK colonize the Lodi and Camporegio variety good than the Verbena cultivar nodule per plant as good as measure of symbiotic efficiency epicotyl length and shoot spin-dry weight show difference among the strainvariety combination FigÂ b to have However the extent of the variation be low than that record for plant root adhesion The high numb of nodule be find on the Lodi variety nodulated by S meliloti AK which be previously interpret as a consequence of its reduce N fixation ability with some alfalfa variety â Interestingly the measure of symbiotic efficiency do not correlate with root adhesion phenotype both adhesion versus spin-dry weight and adhesion versus epicotyl length give nonsignificant Pearson correlation value P However we cannot a priori exclude that measure adhesion over the whole root may not reflect adhesion to the root hair extension zone where rhizobia start the symbiotic interaction For example the large plant be the Lodi variety inoculate with S meliloti BLC despite the root adhesion of this combination be the low Similarly the small plant be the Verbena variety inoculate with S meliloti Rm despite strong root adhesion in this pair

over or underrepresent in all three S meliloti strain during exposure to the Camporegio or Verbena root exudate this include enrichment among the upregulated gene of COG category J and O relate to protein expression and modification suggest that the root exudate stimulate major remodel of the proteome In addition for upregulated gene COG category G carbohydrate transport and metabolism be underrepresent while for the downregulated gene COG category C energy production and conversion be overrepresented This observation suggest that the root exudate stimulate a global change in the cellular energy production pathway versus growth in our standard minimal medium with succinate as the sole carbon source A comparison with growth under soilmimicking condition would be interest with respect to interpret the root exudateinduced change in a ecological context Among the much highly express gene in S meliloti Rm during exposure to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudate be smc and smc encode component of the flagellar apparatus flgF and flgC respectively the orthologs of this gene be not induce in BLC or AK datum Set S worksheet The induction of motility be in contrast to the observation that luteolin alone decrease the motility of the S meliloti Rm strain Presumably this reflect the presence of additional stimulus in the root exudate Indeed amino acid present in root exudate be know to stimulate chemotactic behavior in S meliloti and signaturetagged mutagenesis show that motilityrelated gene be relevant during competition for rhizosphere colonization by S meliloti Rm difference in the transcriptome of two Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens strain expose to root exudate be suggest to be relate to difference in their competitive ability We therefore examine the expression pattern of several gene likely to play a role in competition for rhizosphere colonization and root adhesion It be previously suggest that the sin quorum sense system be involve in competition in S meliloti in our datum sinI smc be repress in S meliloti Rm in the presence of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate but no change in the expression of the orthologous gene in strain AK or BLC be observe No evidence be find in any of the strain for change in the expression of galactoglucan or succinoglucan biosynthesis gene such as wgaA smb and wgeA smb The Verbena and Camporegio root exudate induce the expression of the rhizobactin transport gene sma rhtX of Rm and BLC this gene be not find in AK This may be a consequence of the root exudate chelate the available iron consequently elicit siderophore production that can inhibit the growth of strain lack siderophores Plasmid pSINME of S meliloti AK exhibit similarity with plasmid pHRC of S meliloti C which confer a competitive advantage for nodule occupancy and host range restriction consider that a few of the gene on the plasmid pSINME and pSINME be differentially express upon exposure to root exudate it be possible that the accessory plasmid of strain AK also contribute to competition for rhizosphere colonization difference in gene expression pattern across condition may be relate in part to difference in the presence of flavonoid In S meliloti it be know that root exudate contain flavone molecule activate the transcriptional regulator NodD which trigger the synthesis of Nod factor require for nodule formation To gain insight into the influence of NodD on the observe stimulons we compare the S meliloti Rm datum to that of the wellknown regulons of NodD require plant compound for its activation and NodD not require plant compound but rely on indirect activation through SyrM and NodD establish previously We find that out of the gene of the NodD regulon and be observe in the deg in response to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudate respectively Camporegio and Verbena root extract putatively contain apigenin while the Lodi root extract lack apigenin suggest a role of apigenin in the differential expression pattern observe For the gene of the NodD regulon and be find in the deg in response to the Verbena Camporegio and Lodi root exudate respectively The presence of a partial overlap of the know nod regulons â¼ or few of the deg under each condition suggest that much of the observe deg belong to nodindependent regulons Moreover some of this gene show contrast pattern of expression suggest that the root exudate may also contain antagonistic molecule that repress the nod regulon as previously report Mobilization of the symbiotic megaplasmid result in nonadditive change in stimulons To evaluate the impact of interreplicon epistatic interaction on the transcriptional response of S meliloti to alfalfa root exudate we use RNAseq to characterize the response of a previously construct S meliloti hybrid strain contain the symbiotic megaplasmid pSINMEB of strain BLC Cluster analysis clearly demonstrate that the transcriptome both global and restrict to pSymApSINMEB orthologs only of the hybrid strain differ from that of both the BLC and Rm wildtype strain under all condition FigÂ b FigÂ S Of particular interest be the result observe during exposure to the Lodi root exudate We previously show that alfalfa cv Lodi plant inoculate with the hybrid strain be large than that inoculate with either BLC or Rm Here we observe that exposure to the Lodi root exudate result in much differentially express gene in the hybrid strain gene than in either Rm or BLC and gene respectively TableÂ In particular a cluster of gene be specifically upregulated in the hybrid strain and the majority of this gene be locate on the symbiotic megaplasmid This peculiar feature of the Lodiinduced transcriptome in the hybrid strain be also highlight by the cluster analysis of pSymApSINMEB orthologs only in the hybrid strain do the Lodiinduced expression profile cluster with that of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate FigÂ b The presence of this possibly

phenomenon that begin with a exchange of signal between two partner The rhizobia initially detect the plant through the perception of flavonoid in the root exudate of legume by NodD protein which then trigger the production of lipochitooligosaccharide molecule know as Nod factor Nod factor be then recognize by specific LysM receptor kinase protein in plant root cell trigger the symbiosis signal pathway and initiate the formation of a nodule However root exudate contain a mixture of flavonoid some of them have different agonistic activity on NodD Root exudate also contain many other molecule that can serve as signal or support rhizobium metabolism such as amino acid and sugar that may influence the ability of rhizobia to successfully colonize the rhizosphere and be in a position to enter the symbiosis Consequently interaction between plant and rhizobium genotype be expect to influence the success of the initial interaction between the two partner Previous work have identify a clear role for GxG interaction in the partnership between S meliloti and Medicago truncatula demonstrate that aerial biomass be influence by the plant and rhizobium genotype as good as their interaction Here we demonstrate that GxG interaction also have a significant impact on the adherence of S meliloti strain to alfalfa root as a representative phenotype for a early stage of the interaction between this partner Rhizosphere colonization appear to have a direct impact on nodule colonization while our datum do not address if root adhesion be correlate with competition for nodule occupancy in mix inoculum they suggest that root adhesion be poorly correlate with overall symbiotic efficiency in singleinoculum study Previous study have demonstrate the influence of GxG interaction on the nodule transcriptome of MedicagoSinorhizobium symbiosis Here we show that GxG interaction similarly have a important contribution in determine the transcriptional response of S meliloti to the detection of Medicago sativa root exudate Together this result demonstrate that GxG interaction have a meaningful impact on the outcome of rhizobiumlegume symbiosis at multiple stage of development The exposure of B diazoefficiens to soybean root exudate result in change in the expression of gene represent nearly of the genome and the impact of soybean root exudate differ between the two test B diazoefficiens strain Similarly between and of S meliloti gene be differentially express follow exposure to alfalfa root exudate depend on the hostsymbiont combination The similaritiesdifferences in the response of the three S meliloti strain to treatment do not appear to depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the strain although this cannot be definitively conclude without analysis of additional strain Nevertheless this result emphasize the importance of transcriptional rewire during strain diversification in bacterium Similarly study with eukaryotic organism indicate that adaptation have a important role in differentiate the gene expression pattern of organism The root exudate stimulons only partially overlap the stimulons of luteolin a know inducer of NodD in S meliloti confirm that alfalfa root exudate contain numerous molecular signal aside from flavonoid that may influence the competitiveness of various rhizobium strain Importantly the transcriptional pattern induce by alfalfa root exudate differ depend on the cultivar from which they be collect whether this difference be adaptive require far investigation Additionally although root exudate metabolomic analysis be mainly descriptive and relatively few peak can be identify there be a similar pattern between the difference in the S meliloti gene expression profile and the overall chemical similarity of the root exudate as measure by LCMS the Camporegio and Verbena root exudate induce similar gene expression change while also be similar along the 2 principal component of variance account for of the variance in the PCA of the root exudate composition In future work it would be interest to define which compound in the root exudate have the great impact on the S meliloti transcriptome In addition to the impact of GxG interaction on rhizobiumlegume symbiosis there be the potential for interreplicon interaction within rhizobium genome to far influence the symbiosis Indeed interreplicon epistatic interaction be abundant in the S meliloti genome To address the contribution of interreplicon interaction to symbiosis we examine a hybrid strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid of S meliloti Rm a strain nearly identical to Rm be replace with the symbiotic megaplasmid of S meliloti BLC Nonadditive effect on the transcriptional profile associate with all three replicons be observe in the hybrid strain relative to Rm and BLC indicate that megaplasmid mobilization induce a global rewire of gene expression likely due to transcriptional cross talk among the replicons Similarly nonadditive effect on the transcriptome of plant hybrid have be extensively explore and demonstrate as one of the base for heterosis in crop In previous work look for regulatory module where the transcription factor and target gene reside on different replicons in S meliloti Rm we find transcriptional regulator encode by the chromosome or chromid with predict target gene on the megaplasmid Among that transcription factor system relate to exopolysaccharide production ExpG transport PcaQ and metabolism IolR and GlnBK be present support the hypothesis of a global rewire of gene expression network and a wide range of effect of this rewire The result with the hybrid lead us to hypothesize that the large symbiotic variability observe in natural S meliloti isolate may partly be relate to genomewide transcriptome change follow largescale horizontal gene transfer follow by natural selection Moreover we speculate that while the megaplasmid be the key element for a general response ie cultivar independent to speciesspecific host plant association the rhizobium chromosome and chromid finetune this response in a genotypedependent manner If true however this would limit our ability to predict the competitiveness of rhizobium isolate from their simple genome sequence instead a much complex understand of global regulatory network control would be require In conclusion this study demonstrate that the initial perception of legume by rhizobia lead to hundred of change in the rhizobium transcriptome and that this change be dependent on the plant genotype the rhizobium genotype and genotypebygenotype interaction this result complement previous study demonstrate the role of GxG interaction in determine the transcriptome of both the legume and rhizobium partner in mature Nfixing nodule The majority of gene upregulated in response to alfalfa root exudate be conserve in all three strain support the hypothesis that the S meliloti lineage be adapt to rhizosphere colonization before gain the gene require for symbiotic nitrogen fixation Additionally the transcriptional response to the perception of alfalfa root exudate involve gene from all three of the S meliloti replicons

vary depend on the silage For be silage microorganism include aerobic bacterium Enterobacteriaceae and yeast immediately drop to below the detection level after the onset of fermentation In contrast this microorganism remain present in large count number in the other silage especially the be silage for long period of time Bacterial diversity and composition during SSG fermentation To reveal the

modularity average degree graph density and the ratio of negativepositive interaction be use to describe the topology property and structure of network TableÂ The total edge and average degree decrease in be and PM silage compare to that in be silage suggest a decrease complexity of community structure In addition low negativepositive interaction ratio be observe in be and PM silage than in be silage indicate a low stability of bacterial network during fermentation predict function of bacterial community during SSG fermentation Taxfun be use to predict the metagenomics functional composition base on S rRNA marker gene The predict sequence mainly belong to metabolism to environmental information process to genetic information process to and cellular process to category FigÂ A In the metabolism category at KEGG level three subfunctions namely carbohydrate metabolism to membrane transport to and amino acid metabolism to show the high abundance compare to the abundance of other subfunctions The functional shift of bacterial community during SSG fermentation be show in FigÂ B There be remarkable difference in the functional profile of epiphytic microbiota from various time The be microbiota have much abundant metabolism category such as lipid metabolism energy metabolism amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism The be and PM microbiota have much abundant cell community and cell motility In addition cell growth and death transport and catabolism and signal molecule and interaction be much abundant in PM epiphytic microbiota During fermentation mark upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism be observe after Â day of fermentation and the extent of upregulation be distinct among the silage and follow the order be PM be To investigate the metabolic pathway lead to the difference in carbohydrate metabolism pathway for process carbohydrate be far explore at KEGG level FigÂ C much of the significant pathway difference be observe at day of fermentation In total five and three pathway be significantly downregulated in be and PM silage respectively compare to be silage The much notably downregulated pathway in be silage be starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism and in PM silage be fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism Additionally three pathway include ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism be significantly upregulated in be silage compare to be silage Correlation analysis of bacterial community with fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway The correlation of the top bacterial species with the fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway be explore for each fermentation time FigÂ The correlation between bacterial species and fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway be strong during the initial Â day and become weak after Â day of fermentation After Â day of fermentation enterobacterial species be positively correlate with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism In addition this enterobacterial species be positively correlate with pH and negative correlate with lactic acid and acetic acid during the initial Â day of fermentation UnclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella have negative correlation with pH and WSC and positive correlation with acetic acid NHN lactic acid and ethanol content after Â day of fermentation Moreover this LAB species also show positive correlation with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism Lactobacillus plantarum be positively correlate with acetic acid lactic acid the lactictoacetic acid ratio and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathway and negative correlate with pH after Â day of fermentation After Â day of fermentation Kocuria rhizophila be positively correlate with acetic acid and unclassifiedgChitinophaga and Aeromonas hydrophila be negative correlate with NHN DISCUSSION The current study explore the influence of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on the fermentation characteristic of SSG through gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation In the present study gamma ray irradiation at a sufficient dose entirely sterilize the forage which provide a ideal condition for study the effect of exogenous microbiota inoculation on silage fermentation characteristic The WSC content of the raw material be another important factor in silage fermentation In line with our previous study the WSC content of SSG in the present study satisfy the requirement gkg DM for quality fermentation It suggest the benefit of use SSG as the plant material in silage production The epiphytic microbiota the microorganism naturally present on the surface of plant be responsible for silage fermentation However the aerial part of plant form a highly diverse and dynamic environment where epiphyte need to cope with UV radiation exposure low water and nutrient availability and high temperature fluctuation throughout the day Epiphytic microbiota composition exhibit considerable variation in diurnal and temporal pattern The epiphytic microorganism of great concern in fermentation be LAB enterobacteria aerobic bacterium and yeast Because silage be preserve by lactic acid fermentation only epiphytic LAB be beneficial other be consider undesirable cause either fermentation failure or silage deterioration The present result show that epiphytic LAB count decrease significantly in be and PM microbiota compare to the count in be microbiota This be not surprise since LAB lack many of the microbial trait that be find in phyllosphereadapted bacterium For example many phyllosphere bacterium be pigmented and use this pigment to protect against high level of UV radiation on leaf surface Similarly Li et al report that Â h of UV exposure significantly decrease the LAB count on Siberian wildrye The yeast count also decrease during the day suggest their high sensitivity to the dynamic diurnal environment However this be inconsistent with our previous observation in Napier grass where the yeast count do not change significantly The discrepancy can be associate with the difference in leaf physical structure and nutrient condition between the two forage crop The be microbiota have the high Enterobacteriaceae count which be consistent with the enrichment of Pantoea Pantoea be a genus of Gramnegative bacterium belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae Unlike LAB Pantoea be yellow pigmented motile and grow in mucoidforming colony this trait make them successful inhabitant in the phyllosphere The dominance of Pantoea in be microbiota suggest that the harsh environment during the day may have a effect of enrich stressresistant species in the phyllosphere Silage fermentation depend on epiphytic LAB convert WSC to organic acid mainly lactic acid along with reduction of the pH It be generally accept that at less log CFUg LAB be require for adequate fermentation Therefore the difference in the epiphytic LAB population may explain the vary rate of pH decline and organic acid production among the silage during fermentation However this can not explain the fermentation difference between be and PM silage consider the comparable epiphytic LAB count One explanation can be the high enterobacterial numb in be microbiota compare to the numb in PM microbiota Enterobacteria be principal competitor of LAB for available sugar during fermentation The diurnally enrich enterobacteria may increase their competition with LAB restrain LAB development and far retard the fermentation Likewise Ãstling and Lindgren have report that inoculate a crop with enterobacteria result in temporarily retard rate of lactic acid and acetic acid production The acetic acid content be observe to be high in PM silage after Â day of fermentation suggest a great activity of acetic acidproducing bacterium such as heterolactic acid bacterium The lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio be a indicator of the extent of homofermentation in relation to heterofermentation during fermentation In the present study all SSG silage have a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of suggest the predominance of homofermentation during SSG fermentation The lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio be high in be silage after Â day of fermentation suggest strong homofermentation than in the other silage Ethanol have little preservation effect and its production be associate with extremely high DM and energy loss in silage much than to gkg DM of ethanol production in silage be mainly associate with the action of yeast In the present study all SSG silage have ethanol content of gkg DM suggest that ethanol be mainly produce by microbe like heterolactic acid bacterium and enterobacteria The NHN content be a indicator of the extent of protein breakdown in silage The NHN content of all silage be within the acceptable range of NHN gkg of TN suggest that SSG protein be good preserve during fermentation Generally NHN would accumulate continuously during fermentation However our result indicate that NHN content decrease at the late stage of fermentation A similar phenomenon have be report by Ogunade et al In that study they ascribe it to the oxidization of NHN under low dissolve oxygen condition by some ammoniaoxidizing bacterium Acidification by organic acid produce during fermentation be the main mean of control the growth of undesirable microorganism in silage Therefore it be not surprise that the population of undesirable microorganism include aerobic bacterium Enterobacteriaceae and yeast show overall tendency to decrease during fermentation The undesirable microorganism remain in large count in be silage for long period of time which can be due to its slow pH decline and organic acid production during fermentation Generally diverse bacterial community in crop be form in the field and LAB development will simplify the bacterial community and result in a decline in alpha diversity during fermentation Alpha diversity be low during the early stage of SSG fermentation and increase at the late stage of fermentation This can be closely relate to the change in the LAB population LAB multiply extensively during the early stage of fermentation reach the maximum numb through to âdays of fermentation and then keep decrease in the late fermentation period The be silage have high alpha diversity than the other silage during the initial Â day of fermentation This be possibly due to its have the slow pH decline which do not effectively inhibit the undesirable microorganism accord to the PCoA result the bacterial community composition at day and of fermentation be clearly separate by different inoculation group This suggest that the diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota significantly affect the bacterial community succession during the early stage of SSG fermentation The competition between LAB and undesirable microorganism take place during fermentation and a anaerobic fermentation dominate by LAB be the key to produce a wellpreserved silage Weissella and Leuconostoc be the first dominant LAB genus during SSG fermentation this LAB species be the much isolate from stand plant carry out mix acid fermentation and contribute to the initial pH decline during fermentation Weissella be identify as the indicator LAB in be silage whereas Leuconostoc be the indicator LAB in be silage at day of fermentation It suggest that the vary rate of acidification may result in the establishment of different niche that be favorable for different LAB species After Â day of fermentation moreacidtolerant Lactobacillus begin to dominate the fermentation along with the decrease in the relative abundance of Weissella and Leuconostoc The Lactobacillus bacterium mainly consist of Lactobacillus plantarum which be the much frequent LAB species in anaerobic plant matter as good as in many ferment food product Lactobacillus plantarum generally contribute to the substantial lactic acid accumulation and desirable fermentation property in silage because of its acidresistant nature and superior ability to utilize a wide variety of substrate The fast dominance of Lactobacillus plantarum be consistent with the much rapid and intense lactic acid fermentation in be silage The relative abundance of Lactobacillus parabuchneri be great in PM silage after Â day of fermentation Lactobacillus parabuchneri be a heterofermentative LAB species produce acetic acid as its main product and in addition it can convert lactic acid into acetic acid and propanediol in silage this fact may partly explain the high acetic acid content in PM silage after Â day of fermentation Enterobacteria be the primary undesirable bacterium that show difference in abundance in epiphytic microbiota and silage among different inoculation group The dominant enterobacteria in the epiphytic microbiota be mainly Pantoea species whereas they be rapidly replace by Enterobacter Klebsiella and Escherichia coli after the begin of fermentation This be consistent with the report of Li and Nishino that the enterobacteria find on fresh grass would be replace by enterobacterial species which adapt good to the silage environment After Â day of fermentation Pantoea be again detect in large abundance suggest that some member of the Pantoea genus can survive the anaerobic acid environment Similarly Liang et al report that Pantoea bacterium be detect apparently at early and late stage of paocai fermentation Among the silage enterobacteria include Enterobacter Klebsiella and Pantoea be specifically enrich in be silage at the early stage of fermentation It be generally accept that a rapid pH decline be the key to control enterobacteria in silage Their prosperity can be due to the retard fermentation that allow them to persist long in the silage Enterobacter be a common genus during natural fermentation of various forage crop A high relative abundance of Enterobacter can enhance the ammonia and biogenic amine production by deaminating and decarboxylating amino acid in silage Klebsiella species can destabilize silage aerobic stability and some species be opportunistic pathogen that can cause mastitis in animal The role of Pantoea species in silage fermentation be little know However researcher consider that they have a role similar to that of Enterobacter species compete with LAB for available sugar during fermentation Microbial community be shape by interaction among the population that affect the community dynamic and function The exploration of cooccurrence network offer new insight into the structure of complex microbial community The result demonstrate that the complexity of the bacterial network decrease in be and PM silage compare to the bacterial network in be silage Hernandez et al point out that the complexity of microbial network would decrease along with the stress gradient this result suggest that the stressful environment during the day may have act as a strong filter factor against the exist epiphytic bacterial species and affect the species cooccurrence pattern during fermentation Butler and OâDwyer suggest that positive pairwise interaction can push community close to instability The stress bacterial community have low ratio of negativepositive interaction during fermentation suggest the low stability of community The low ratio of negativepositive interaction in the cooccurrence network can be due to some âcompetitiveâ taxon that engage in antagonistic interspecific interaction during fermentation be replace by stresstolerant species eg oligotrophic microbe For example some OTUs affiliate with LAB species such as unclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella be replace by bacterial species like Pantoea dispersa or member of MethylobacteriumMethylorubrum FigÂ In accordance with our previous study carbohydrate metabolism membrane transport and amino acid metabolism be the main metabolic pathway involve in silage fermentation The epiphytic microbiota from various time have remarkably different functional profile suggest their different metabolic potential The be and PM microbiota have much abundant cell community and great cell motility than the be microbiota The increase abundance of this pathway can be associate with the enrichment of stressresistant bacterium in SSG during the day Different epiphytic microbiota induce various extent of upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism during fermentation reflect their different capacity in metabolize WSC Some carbohydrate metabolism pathway be significantly downregulated in be and PM silage compare to their regulation in be silage after Â day of fermentation this result suggest that the loss of function of the bacterial community in metabolize some type of carbohydrate contribute greatly to delay fermentation in the silage Notably among the downregulated pathway starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism be especially downregulated in be silage Starch and sucrose be the major storage form of carbohydrate in sorghum and pyruvate be the precursor for the generation of organic acid like lactic acid Î±acetolactate acetic acid and formic acid The downregulation of metabolism pathway relate to that key carbohydrate and metabolite may strongly limit lactic acid fermentation possibly explain why fermentation be retard to the great extent in be silage Apart from the downregulated pathway some carbohydrate metabolism pathway be observe to be upregulated in be silage compare to be silage this include ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism Yin et al report that metabolism of ascorbate and aldarate and Cbranched dibasic acid would consume large amount of sugar They suggest that the presence of this pathway would compete for the available sugar and shift the carbon flux away from lactic acid synthesis The flourish of enterobacteria would deplete carbohydrate reserve and result in the failure of LAB to dominate fermentation After Â day of fermentation enterobacterial species be positively correlate with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism This confirm that they be the main substrate competitor of LAB during the fermentation Among the enterobacterial species Pantoea dispersa be also positively correlate with the compete pathway suggest that diurnally enrich Pantoea bacterium can increase the competitive pressure on LAB during fermentation Enterobacterial species be sensitive to pH decline Therefore they be positively correlate with pH and negative correlate with lactic acid Besides lactic acid acetic acid also show negative correlation with the enterobacterial species at day of fermentation Acetic acid be know to retard enterobacterial growth in silage Negative correlation between acetic acid and enterobacterial species suggest its important role in inhibit enterobacterial growth at the initial stage of fermentation After Â day of fermentation acetic acid and lactic acid be positively correlate with unclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella Moreover this LAB species also show positive correlation with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism this result suggest that they play key role in the production of organic acid and the control of enterobacteria at the initial stage of fermentation Lactobacillus plantarum contain a comprehensive carbohydrate utilization system compose of plentiful sugar uptake and metabolismrelated gene that endow it with its strong carbohydrate utilization ability After Â day of fermentation Lactobacillus plantarum be positively correlate with acetic acid lactic acid the lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathway This confirm the key role of Lactobacillus plantarum in extensive carbohydrate metabolism and the production of organic acid during the fermentation process After Â day of fermentation the few correlation between bacterial species and fermentation characteristic indicate the decrease effect of bacterial community on fermentation at the late stage However it be observe that Kocuria rhizophila be positively correlate with acetic acid after Â day of fermentation Kocuria rhizophila possess a complete set of gene for acetate catabolism via the glyoxylate cycle pathway The positive correlation suggest that high acetic acid content may favor the survival and growth of Kocuria rhizophila in SSG silage Aeromonads preferentially use ammonium as their nitrogen source and Chitinophaga bacterium be identify as the nitrifiers in activate sludge under low dissolve oxygen condition Negative correlation of Aeromonas hydrophila and unclassifiedgChitinophaga with NHN suggest that this bacterium may be responsible for the decrease NHN content at the late stage of fermentation Conclusion Gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation offer the opportunity to evaluate the effect of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on silage fermentation The result show that the epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvest at various time of the day vary greatly in composition and function The diurnal variation affect the competition between LAB and enterobacteria lead to increase proportion of Pantoea dispersa Leuconostoc lactis Enterobacter and Klebsiella variicola whereas the proportion of Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus plantarum in be silage decrease during fermentation compare to their proportion in be silage mark difference in fermentation characteristic be observe among the silage during the initial Â day of fermentation with the fast pH decline and organic acid production in be silage and the slow in be silage Both be and PM silage exhibit decrease in the complexity and stability of bacterial network compare to that in be silage during the fermentation Our study reveal the importance of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation which provide clue for technological parameter optimization for the fermentation

biomass for animal and bioenergy production worldwide The fermentation quality of silage be largely dependent on the epiphytic microbiota of the material Plant epiphytic microbiota exhibit diurnal

INTRODUCTION Silage make be a worldwide practice that use the natural fermentation carry out by epiphytic microbiota permit forage crop to be store for extend period The production of silage be important for agricultural and industrial value chain It provide not only conserve forage for livestock but also substrate for bioenergy production In many European country silage production account for a large share of the fee and substrate supply The biochemistry of silage fermentation be essentially a simple process but the interaction of microbial and chemical composition can result in a high degree of variability in fermentation quality Nevertheless regardless of the silage production purpose quality fermentation be essential for the preservation of biomass and its subsequent use The quality of fermentation be largely dependent on the epiphytic microbiota naturally present on forage Unlike grain production the biomass use for silage production be the aboveground part of the plant It be expose to the atmosphere and subject to the diurnal cycle The population of many epiphytic microorganism undergo pronounce change throughout the day as a consequence of direct impact by environmental fluctuation and indirect influence by plant metabolism It be good establish that this turnover rhythm of epiphytic microbiota result in significant change in composition and function However possible effect bring by this diurnal change on silage fermentation be rarely explore likely because that effect be difficult to differentiate from the effect bring by chemical change Recently silage researcher start to use microbiota transplantation to clarify the role of exogenous epiphytic microbiota in silage quality They demonstrate that exogenous microbiota can reconstruct a similar function in the recipient plant Moreover gamma ray radiation be popular in silage research since it can sterilize forage without significantly alter plant chemical composition and enzyme activity The

vary depend on the silage For be silage microorganism include aerobic bacterium Enterobacteriaceae and yeast immediately drop to below the detection level after the onset of fermentation In contrast

decrease in be and PM silage compare to that in be silage suggest a decrease complexity of community structure In addition low negativepositive interaction ratio be observe in be and PM silage than in be silage indicate a low stability of bacterial network during fermentation predict function of bacterial community during SSG fermentation Taxfun be use to predict the metagenomics functional composition base on S rRNA marker gene The predict sequence mainly belong to metabolism to environmental information process to genetic information process to and cellular process to category FigÂ A In the metabolism category at KEGG level three subfunctions namely carbohydrate metabolism to membrane transport to and amino acid metabolism to show the high abundance compare to the abundance of other subfunctions The functional shift of bacterial community during SSG fermentation be show in FigÂ B There be remarkable difference in the functional profile of epiphytic microbiota from various time The be microbiota have much abundant metabolism category such as lipid metabolism energy metabolism amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism The be and PM microbiota have much abundant cell community and cell motility In addition cell growth and death transport and catabolism and signal molecule and interaction be much abundant in PM epiphytic microbiota During fermentation mark upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism be observe after Â day of fermentation and the extent of upregulation be distinct among the silage and follow the order be PM be To investigate the metabolic pathway lead to the difference in carbohydrate metabolism pathway for process carbohydrate be far explore at KEGG level FigÂ C much of the significant pathway difference be observe at day of fermentation In total five and three pathway be significantly downregulated in be and PM silage respectively compare to be silage The much notably downregulated pathway in be silage be starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism and in PM silage be fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism Additionally three pathway include ascorbate and aldarate

fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway The correlation of the top bacterial species with the fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway be explore for each fermentation time FigÂ The correlation between bacterial species and fermentation characteristic and carbohydrate metabolism pathway be strong during the initial Â day and become weak after Â day of fermentation After Â day of fermentation enterobacterial species be positively correlate with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism In addition this enterobacterial species be positively correlate with pH and negative correlate with lactic acid and acetic acid during the initial Â day of fermentation UnclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella have negative correlation with pH and WSC and positive correlation with acetic acid NHN lactic acid and ethanol content after Â day of fermentation Moreover this LAB species also show positive correlation with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism Lactobacillus plantarum be positively correlate with acetic acid lactic acid the lactictoacetic acid ratio and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathway and negative correlate with pH after Â day of fermentation After Â day of fermentation Kocuria rhizophila be positively correlate with acetic acid and unclassifiedgChitinophaga and Aeromonas hydrophila be negative correlate with NHN DISCUSSION The current study explore the influence of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on the fermentation characteristic of SSG through gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation In the present study gamma ray irradiation at a sufficient dose entirely sterilize the forage which provide a ideal condition for study the effect of exogenous microbiota inoculation on silage fermentation characteristic The WSC content of the raw material be another important factor in silage fermentation In line with our previous study the WSC content of SSG in the present study satisfy the requirement gkg DM for quality fermentation It suggest the benefit of use SSG as the plant material in silage production The epiphytic microbiota the microorganism naturally present on the surface of plant be responsible for silage fermentation However the aerial part of plant form a highly diverse and dynamic environment where epiphyte need to cope with UV radiation exposure low water and nutrient availability and high temperature fluctuation throughout the day Epiphytic microbiota composition exhibit considerable variation in diurnal and temporal pattern The epiphytic microorganism of great concern in fermentation be LAB enterobacteria aerobic bacterium and yeast Because silage be preserve by lactic acid fermentation only epiphytic LAB be beneficial other be consider undesirable cause either fermentation failure or silage deterioration The present result show that epiphytic LAB count decrease significantly in be and PM microbiota compare to the count in be microbiota This be not surprise since LAB lack many of the microbial trait that be find in phyllosphereadapted bacterium For example many phyllosphere bacterium be pigmented and use this pigment to protect against high level of UV radiation on leaf surface Similarly Li et al report that Â h of UV exposure significantly decrease the LAB count on Siberian wildrye The yeast count also decrease during the day suggest their high sensitivity to the dynamic diurnal environment However this be inconsistent with our previous observation in Napier grass where the yeast count do not change significantly The discrepancy can be associate with the difference in leaf physical structure and nutrient condition between the two forage crop The be microbiota have the high Enterobacteriaceae count which be consistent with the enrichment of Pantoea Pantoea be a genus of Gramnegative bacterium belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae Unlike LAB Pantoea be yellow pigmented motile and grow in mucoidforming colony this trait make them successful inhabitant in the phyllosphere The dominance of Pantoea in be microbiota suggest that the harsh environment during the day may have a effect of enrich stressresistant species in the phyllosphere Silage fermentation depend on epiphytic LAB convert WSC to organic acid mainly lactic acid along with reduction of the pH It be generally accept that at less log CFUg LAB be require for adequate fermentation Therefore the difference in the epiphytic LAB population may explain the vary rate of pH decline and organic acid production among the silage during fermentation However this can not explain the fermentation difference between be and PM silage consider the comparable epiphytic LAB count One explanation can be the high enterobacterial numb in be microbiota compare to the numb in PM microbiota Enterobacteria be principal competitor of LAB for available sugar during fermentation The diurnally enrich enterobacteria may increase their competition with LAB restrain LAB development and far retard the fermentation Likewise Ãstling and Lindgren have report that inoculate a crop with enterobacteria result in temporarily retard rate of lactic acid and acetic acid production The acetic acid content be observe to be high in PM silage after Â day of fermentation suggest a great activity of acetic acidproducing bacterium such as heterolactic acid bacterium The lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio be a indicator of the extent of homofermentation in relation to heterofermentation during fermentation In the present study all SSG silage have a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of suggest the predominance of homofermentation during SSG fermentation The lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio be high in be silage after Â day of fermentation suggest strong homofermentation than in the other silage Ethanol have little preservation effect and its production be associate with extremely high DM and energy loss in silage much than to gkg DM of ethanol production in silage be mainly associate with the action of yeast In the present study all SSG silage have ethanol content of gkg DM suggest that ethanol be mainly produce by microbe like heterolactic acid bacterium and enterobacteria The NHN content be a indicator of the extent of protein breakdown in silage The NHN content of all silage be within the acceptable range of NHN gkg of TN suggest that SSG protein be good preserve during fermentation Generally NHN would accumulate continuously during fermentation However our result indicate that NHN content decrease at the late stage of fermentation A similar phenomenon have be report by Ogunade et al In that study they ascribe it to the oxidization of NHN under low dissolve oxygen condition by some ammoniaoxidizing bacterium Acidification by organic acid produce during fermentation be the main mean of control the growth of undesirable microorganism in silage Therefore it be not surprise that the population of undesirable microorganism include aerobic bacterium Enterobacteriaceae and yeast show overall tendency to decrease during fermentation The undesirable microorganism remain in large count in be silage for long period of time which can be due to its slow pH decline and organic acid production during fermentation Generally diverse bacterial community in crop be form in the field and LAB development will simplify the bacterial community and result in a decline in alpha diversity during fermentation Alpha diversity be low during the early stage of SSG fermentation and increase at the late stage of fermentation This can be closely relate to the change in the LAB population LAB multiply extensively during the early stage of fermentation reach the maximum numb through to âdays of fermentation and then keep decrease in the late fermentation period The be silage have high alpha diversity than the other silage during the initial Â day of fermentation This be possibly due to its have the slow pH decline which do not effectively inhibit the undesirable microorganism accord to the PCoA result the bacterial community composition at day and of fermentation be clearly separate by different inoculation group This suggest that the diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota significantly affect the bacterial community succession during the early stage of SSG fermentation The competition between LAB and undesirable microorganism take place during fermentation and a anaerobic fermentation dominate by LAB be the key to produce a wellpreserved silage Weissella and Leuconostoc be the first dominant LAB genus during SSG fermentation this LAB species be the much isolate from stand plant carry out mix acid fermentation and contribute to the initial pH decline during fermentation Weissella be identify as the indicator LAB in be silage whereas Leuconostoc be the indicator LAB in be silage at day of fermentation It suggest that the vary rate of acidification may result in the establishment of different niche that be favorable for different LAB species After Â day of fermentation moreacidtolerant Lactobacillus begin to dominate the fermentation along with the decrease in the relative abundance of Weissella and Leuconostoc The Lactobacillus bacterium mainly consist of Lactobacillus plantarum which be the much frequent LAB species in anaerobic plant matter as good as in many ferment food product Lactobacillus plantarum generally contribute to the substantial lactic acid accumulation and desirable fermentation property in silage because of its acidresistant nature and superior ability to utilize a wide variety of substrate The fast dominance of Lactobacillus plantarum be consistent with the much rapid and intense lactic acid fermentation in be silage The relative abundance of Lactobacillus parabuchneri be great in PM silage after Â day of fermentation Lactobacillus parabuchneri be a heterofermentative LAB species produce acetic acid as its main product and in addition it can convert lactic acid into acetic acid and propanediol in silage this fact may partly explain the high acetic acid content in PM silage after Â day of fermentation Enterobacteria be the primary undesirable bacterium that show difference in abundance in epiphytic microbiota and silage among different inoculation group The dominant enterobacteria in the epiphytic microbiota be mainly Pantoea species whereas they be rapidly replace by Enterobacter Klebsiella and Escherichia coli after the begin of fermentation This be consistent with the report of Li and Nishino that the enterobacteria find on fresh grass would be replace by enterobacterial species which adapt good to the silage environment After Â day of fermentation Pantoea be again detect in large abundance suggest that some member of the Pantoea genus can survive the anaerobic acid environment Similarly Liang et al report that Pantoea bacterium be detect apparently at early and late stage of paocai fermentation Among the silage enterobacteria include Enterobacter Klebsiella and Pantoea be specifically enrich in be silage at the early stage of fermentation It be generally accept that a rapid pH decline be the key to control enterobacteria in silage Their prosperity can be due to the retard fermentation that allow them to persist long in the silage Enterobacter be a common genus during natural fermentation of various forage crop A high relative abundance of Enterobacter can enhance the ammonia and biogenic amine production by deaminating and decarboxylating amino acid in silage Klebsiella species can destabilize silage aerobic stability and some species be opportunistic pathogen that can cause mastitis in animal The role of Pantoea species in silage fermentation be little know However researcher consider that they have a role similar to that of Enterobacter species compete with LAB for available sugar during fermentation Microbial community be shape by interaction among the population that affect the community dynamic and function The exploration of cooccurrence network offer new insight into the structure of complex microbial community The result demonstrate that the complexity of the bacterial network decrease in be and PM silage compare to the bacterial network in be silage Hernandez et al point out that the complexity of microbial network would decrease along with the stress gradient this result suggest that the stressful environment during the day may have act as a strong filter factor against the exist epiphytic bacterial species and affect the species cooccurrence pattern during fermentation Butler and OâDwyer suggest that positive pairwise interaction can push community close to instability The stress bacterial community have low ratio of negativepositive interaction during fermentation suggest the low stability of community The low ratio of negativepositive interaction in the cooccurrence network can be due to some âcompetitiveâ taxon that engage in antagonistic interspecific interaction during fermentation be replace by stresstolerant species eg oligotrophic microbe For example some OTUs affiliate with LAB species such as unclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella be replace by bacterial species like Pantoea dispersa or member of MethylobacteriumMethylorubrum FigÂ In accordance with our previous study carbohydrate metabolism membrane transport and amino acid metabolism be the main metabolic pathway involve in silage fermentation The epiphytic microbiota from various time have remarkably different functional profile suggest their different metabolic potential The be and PM microbiota have much abundant cell community and great cell motility than the be microbiota The increase abundance of this pathway can be associate with the enrichment of stressresistant bacterium in SSG during the day Different epiphytic microbiota induce various extent of upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism during fermentation reflect their different capacity in metabolize WSC Some carbohydrate metabolism pathway be significantly downregulated in be and PM silage compare to their regulation in be silage after Â day of fermentation this result suggest that the loss of function of the bacterial community in metabolize some type of carbohydrate contribute greatly to delay fermentation in the silage Notably among the downregulated pathway starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism be especially downregulated in be silage Starch and sucrose be the major storage form of carbohydrate in sorghum and pyruvate be the precursor for the generation of organic acid like lactic acid Î±acetolactate acetic acid and formic acid The downregulation of metabolism pathway relate to that key carbohydrate and metabolite may strongly limit lactic acid fermentation possibly explain why fermentation be retard to the great extent in be silage Apart from the downregulated pathway some carbohydrate metabolism pathway be observe to be upregulated in be silage compare to be silage this include ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism Yin et al report that metabolism of ascorbate and aldarate and Cbranched dibasic acid would consume large amount of sugar They suggest that the presence of this pathway would compete for the available sugar and shift the carbon flux away from lactic acid synthesis The flourish of enterobacteria would deplete carbohydrate reserve and result in the failure of LAB to dominate fermentation After Â day of fermentation enterobacterial species be positively correlate with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and Cbranched dibasic acid metabolism This confirm that they be the main substrate competitor of LAB during the fermentation Among the enterobacterial species Pantoea dispersa be also positively correlate with the compete pathway suggest that diurnally enrich Pantoea bacterium can increase the competitive pressure on LAB during fermentation Enterobacterial species be sensitive to pH decline Therefore they be positively correlate with pH and negative correlate with lactic acid Besides lactic acid acetic acid also show negative correlation with the enterobacterial species at day of fermentation Acetic acid be know to retard enterobacterial growth in silage Negative correlation between acetic acid and enterobacterial species suggest its important role in inhibit enterobacterial growth at the initial stage of fermentation After Â day of fermentation acetic acid and lactic acid be positively correlate with unclassifiedgLactococcus and unclassifiedgWeissella Moreover this LAB species also show positive correlation with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism this result suggest that they play key role in the production of organic acid and the control of enterobacteria at the initial stage of fermentation Lactobacillus plantarum contain a comprehensive carbohydrate utilization system compose of plentiful sugar uptake and metabolismrelated gene that endow it with its strong carbohydrate utilization ability After Â day of fermentation Lactobacillus plantarum be positively correlate with acetic acid lactic acid the lactic acidtoacetic acid ratio and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathway This confirm the key role of Lactobacillus plantarum in extensive carbohydrate metabolism and the production of organic acid during the fermentation process After Â day of fermentation the few correlation between bacterial species and fermentation characteristic indicate the decrease effect of bacterial community on fermentation at the late stage However it be observe that Kocuria rhizophila be positively correlate with acetic acid after Â day of fermentation Kocuria rhizophila possess a complete set of gene for acetate catabolism via the glyoxylate cycle pathway The positive correlation suggest that high acetic acid content may favor the survival and growth of Kocuria rhizophila in SSG silage Aeromonads preferentially use ammonium as their nitrogen source and Chitinophaga bacterium be identify as the nitrifiers in activate sludge under low dissolve oxygen condition Negative correlation of Aeromonas hydrophila and unclassifiedgChitinophaga with NHN suggest that this bacterium may be responsible for the decrease NHN content at the late stage of fermentation Conclusion Gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation offer the opportunity to evaluate the effect of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on silage fermentation The result show that the epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvest at various time of the day vary greatly in composition and function The diurnal variation affect the competition between LAB and enterobacteria lead to increase proportion of Pantoea dispersa Leuconostoc lactis Enterobacter and Klebsiella variicola whereas the proportion of Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus plantarum in be silage decrease during fermentation compare to their proportion in be silage mark difference in fermentation characteristic be observe among the silage during the initial Â day of fermentation with the fast pH decline and organic acid production in be silage and the slow in be silage Both be and PM silage exhibit decrease in the complexity and stability of bacterial network compare to that in be silage during the fermentation Our study reveal the importance of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation which provide clue for technological parameter optimization for the fermentation

replicate in indistinguishable digestive pv that fully mature through the endolysosomal pathway Coxiella burnetii be a wideranging facultative intracellular bacterium that cause the zoonosis Q fever a disease that generally manifest as a acute debilitate flulike illness A small developmental form of the pathogen confer pronounce environmental stability a characteristic that facilitate aerosol transmission of the organism Human infection primarily occur via inhalation of contaminate material generate by domestic livestock the primary animal reservoir of C burnetii The organism be highly infectious with the infective dose approach one bacterium The main target cell of C burnetii during natural infection be mononuclear phagocyte such as alveolar macrophage Consequently infection of culture primary or immortalize human monocytesmacrophages be consider the much physiologically relevant in vitro model of C burnetiihost cell interaction In human mononuclear phagocyte and other cell type C burnetii replicate within a membranebound compartment term the parasitophorous vacuole PV The genetic intractability of C burnetii have limit the availability of knowledge of the pathogen virulence mechanism and hostpathogen interaction Currently lipopolysaccharide lp be the only confirm virulence factor of the organism Fulllength lp be produce by virulent phase I organism isolate from natural source and infection typify by the Nine Mile phase I variant NMI reference strain strain RSA Serial passage of phase I C burnetii in embryonated egg or tissue culture select for phase II bacterium which produce a severely truncate lp that lack the O antigen and some core sugar A clone phase II variant originate from NMI term Nine Mile phase II variant NMII strain RSA clone have a â¼kb chromosomal deletion that eliminate multiple gene involve in lp biosynthesis and be avirulent for immunocompetent mouse and guinea pig NMII be a biosafety level organism while biosafety level be require for all other C burnetii strain A conundrum in C burnetii biology be whether the virulence property of NMI and NMII be associate with the ultimate maturation state of their respective pv in rest primary human monocyte andor macrophage pv of both phase variant decorate with the late endosomallysosomal marker lysosomeassociated membrane protein LAMP CD LAMP and the vacuolar type H ATPase and be moderately acidic pH â¼ However on the basis of the minimal recruitment of cathepsin have and the small GTPase Rab it have be suggest that maturation of pv contain NMI stall at a late endosomal stage This traffic behavior correlate with pathogen survival but in much case little to no replication Conversely pv shelter NMII be propose to fully mature into a bactericidal phagolysosomal compartment that contain active lysosomal hydrolase In conflict with the phasespecific traffic model in human mononuclear phagocyte be the observation that NMI and NMII both grow robustly in CDpositive pv of human monocytederived dendritic cell DCs Moreover phase variant productively infect THP cell and primary nonhuman primate alveolar macrophage where they induce similar host cell prosurvival response In animal cell line NMI and NMII replicate equally in vacuole that fully mature to contain lysosomal marker For example pv harbor replicate NMI in murine L fibroblast and J macrophage clearly fuse with lysosome as evidence by the presence of active acid phosphatase and â²nucleotidase NMII have also recently be demonstrate to replicate in a cathepsin Dpositive vacuole in human HeLa epithelial cell Because multiple laboratory have recently employ avirulent NMII to investigate C burnetii infection of host cell it be important to ascertain the degree to which in vitro infection by NMII recapitulate infection by virulent NMI particularly with respect to PV maturation in human mononuclear phagocyte To this end we directly compare the growth kinetic and PV maturation of NMI and NMII in human monocytederived macrophage HMDMs and phorbol myristate acetate PMAdifferentiated THP cell which accurately mimic the property of human primary macrophage Additionally the cytokine response of infect HMDMs be examine as be the degradative property and cathepsin activity of pv We conclude that human macrophage respond similarly to NMI and NMII C burnetii

NMII in both HMDMs and THP cell use qPCR to quantify genome equivalent The growth kinetic of NMI and NMII be similar in both cell type Fig Over a day incubation approximately and logunit increase in genome equivalent be observe in HMDMs and THP cell respectively Generation time during exponential phase to day pi for NMI and NMII in HMDMs be and h respectively fast growth be observe in THP cell with generation time be and h for NMI and NMII respectively NMI and NMII also grow similarly in undifferentiated primary human monocyte with approximately log unit of growth be observe at day pi datum not shownHMDMs infect with NMI and NMII secrete comparable level of proinflammatory cytokine We have previously show that innate immune recognition of NMI by human DCs be attenuate Evidence suggest that this effect be mediate by the shield of NMI surface tolllike receptor TLR ligand by fulllength lp Conversely interaction between NMII and human DCs result in the significant maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine To examine whether this behavior extend to interaction between C burnetii phase variant and HMDMs cell be infect for h with NMI or NMII and then the cell culture medium concentration of TNFÎ± and IL be determine Similar amount of each proinflammatory cytokine be secrete by cell infect with either phase variant Fig NMI and NMII replicate within the same pv in HMDMs and THP cell As a initial examination of the traffic property of NMI and NMII in human macrophage HMDM and THP cell be coinfected with both phase variant and the localization of the organism to common or distinct CDpositive pv be assess by confocal fluorescence microscopy Roughly equal number of NMI and NMII be find in a common large and spacious PV at day pi in both cell type Fig A similar observation be make at and day pi in THP cell and HMDMs respectively with the pv be nearly fill with replicate organism at this time point this result show that a single PV can support growth of both phase variantsPVs harbor NMI or NMII PV decorate similarly with endolysosomal marker The cohabitation of both phase variant in a common PV within coinfected human macrophage suggest that pv harbor just NMI or NMII mature to a similar stage in the endolysosomal cascade To examine PV maturation traffic of the early endosome marker Rab the late endosome marker Rab the late endosomelysosome marker CD Fig A and the lysosome marker cathepsin have Fig B be examine in infect THP cell The percentage of early h pi or late h pi NMI or NMII pv that decorate with each marker be statistically the same Fig C The percentage of pv positive for late endosomelysosome marker increase from to h pi For example the proportion of NMII pv positive for CD increase from Â± to Â± Moreover at h pi both NMI and NMII pv show high percentage of label for the lysosomal aspartate protease cathepsin have Â± and Â± respectively Acquisition of late endosomelysosome marker correlate with decrease label for Rab For example the percentage of NMII positive for Rab decrease from Â± to Â± between and h pi Collectively this datum suggest that pv harbor NMI or NMII mature similarly through the endolysosomal pathway to ultimately acquire characteristic of a phagolysosomeNMI and NMII pv be degradative proteolytic compartment that contain active cathepsin Typical phagolysosomes be degradative compartment due to a diverse array of acidactivated lysosomal hydrolase The degradative capacity of the C burnetii PV be unknown Thus as a initial probe to determine whether C burnetii recruitment of lysosomal marker correlate with degradative function THP cell infect with NMI or NMII for h be superinfected for h with E coli express mCherry red fluorescent protein Live cell be then visualize by phasecontrast and fluorescence microscopy E coli cell that have traffic to either NMI or NMII pv be quickly degrade indicate by the presence of disrupt organism and release mCherry protein in the PV lumen Fig Indeed timelapse video microscopy show the leakage of mCherry protein by E coli within min of entry into pv with some organism be completely destroy within min of entry see Video S in the supplemental material Severely disrupt E coli cell that appear to be under osmotic stress be also evident by TEM Fig Lysosomal protease in C burnetii pv can contribute to degradation of E coli To determine if the vacuole be proteolytically active THP cell be infect with NMII for h and then incubate with Alexa Fluor dextran and DQ Green BSA for h to allow fluidphase uptake and traffic to the pv Alexa Fluor dextran be employ to label the pv with a nondigestible fluorescent probe DQ Green BSA be use to qualitatively assess the proteolytic property of the pv The molecule be a selfquenched difluoroboraaadiazaSindacene BODIPY dye conjugate of BSA where quench be relieve upon proteolysis of the protein to single dyelabeled peptide A typical merge Zseries of confocal fluorescence micrograph show a uniform distribution of red fluorescent dextran in the PV lumen Conversely green fluorescent cleave DQ Green BSA show a ringlike association with the PV membrane and a mottle distribution in the PV lumen Fig A Membraneassociated fluorescence be also clearly evident in Î¼m confocal slice datum not show The distribution of fluorescent DQ Green BSA suggest that proteolytic activity be associate with the PV membrane As show in Fig B cathepsin have localize to the PV membrane however the protease have inactive proenzyme and active mature form that be not differentiate by the polyclonal serum use in this study Therefore we determine whether DQ Green BSA proteolysis and potentially presentation correlate with active cathepsin have The assay be repeat with NMIIinfected THP cell that be incubate for h prior to microscopy with medium alone or medium contain DQ Green BSA with or without pepstatin A a inhibitor of cathepsin have DQ Green BSAAlexa Fluor dextran fluorescence ratio be then determine as describe in material and method A significantly high ratio be observe with pv secondarily load with DQ Green BSA than with pv secondarily load with DQ Green BSA plus pepstatin A or medium alone Fig B indicate that active cathepsin have contribute to DQ Green BSA degradation The lack of a confocal microscope in our biosafety level laboratory preclude a similar quantitative analysis of NMI PV cathepsin have activity However a qualitative evaluation of activity be conduct by load THP cell infect for h with DQ Red BSA and visualize the pv by phasecontrast and epifluorescence microscopy NMI pv show substantial red fluorescence indicate proteolysis of the substrate The fluorescence be considerably reduce in cell treat with pepstatin A Fig C A similar result be observe for NMII PV datum not show To determine whether active cysteine protease be also present in C burnetii pv THP cell infect for h be stain with MRRR a membranepermeant cresyl violetconjugated peptide that be a specific substrate of cathepsin B As a control cell contain C trachomatis pv h pi which have negligible interaction with the endocytic pathway be also stain Intact MRRR be nonfluorescent while the enzymatically cleave substrate generate red fluorescence when it be excite at to nm By phasecontrast and epifluorescence microscopy pv contain NMI or NMII show intense red fluorescence min after substrate addition Fig Timelapse video microscopy show the appearance of red fluorescence in pv as early as s after substrate addition see Video S in the supplemental material As expect C trachomatis pv show no fluorescence Fig Similar result be obtain use MR substrate specific for cathepsin K and L datum not show Collectively this datum indicate that multiple proteolytically active cathepsin be present in both NMI and NMII PVsDISCUSSION Here we show that virulent NMI and avirulent NMII traffic similarly in HMDMs and THP cell to reside in a degradative phagolysosomelike compartment that be permissive for growth In each cell type they replicate with comparable kinetic however on the basis of the net increase in the number of C burnetii genome equivalent between lag and stationary phase THP cell appear to be moderately much permissive for growth show a logunit increase which be similar to that observe in nonphagocytic Vero cell The occurrence of replicate NMI and NMII within the same pv of coinfected human macrophage be consistent with the result of a previous study and far support the idea that phase variant do not direct maturation of biologically distinct PV Although we do not specifically examine vacuolar pH study use ratiometric pHsensitive probe and different cell type have consistently show that NMI and NMII pv have a similar phagolysosomelike pH â¼ This degree of acidification along with the presence of active lysosomal hydrolase be a reliable indicator of lysosome fusion Akporiaye et al determine that the overall activity of multiple lysosomal enzyme in cellular extract of NMIinfected J murine macrophagelike cell be unaltered and along with Howe and Mallavia demonstrate that the lumen of individual pv contain active acid phosphatase This study demonstrate that pv harbor NMI or NMII be proteolytically active and that both cysteine and aspartate cathepsin contribute to proteolysis Cathepsin have have also be localize to NMII pv in CHO and HeLa cell where the vacuole degrade DQ Green BSA Notably NMII show no growth defect in either cell line Interestingly a recent report demonstrate that pretreatment of HMDMs with apoptotic lymphocyte enhance NMI replication with a correspond increase in the percentage of early pv that decorate with cathepsin have Thus full phagosome maturation in this context do not correlate with increase C burnetii kill How C burnetii resist degradation by the lysosomal constituent of its PV be a puzzle Resistance do not appear to require pathogen metabolism as chloramphenicoltreated organism remain viable for several day in lysosomelike vacuole of Vero cell Furthermore our result show similar growth of NMI and NMII in human macrophage indicate that fulllength lp be not require for protection One possible resistance mechanism be the production by C burnetii of peptidoglycanassociated protein that be protease resistant Avirulence in intracellular bacterium be often associate with defect in phagosome modification For example mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis deficient in phagosome arrest be quickly kill by macrophage NMII avirulence be unrelated to phagosome arrest instead it appear to be strictly relate to production of truncate lp Indeed use resequencing microarray we have recently find that in addition to the bp deletion of lp biosynthesis gene NMII have single nucleotide polymorphism relative to the sequence of NMI but none be predict to disrupt the protein require for intracellular growth and virulence P A Beare and R A Heinzen unpublished datum Fulllength C burnetii lp act as a virulence factor by shield the outer membrane thereby confer resistance to complementmediated kill and mask surface TLR ligand from innate immune recognition by human DCs Exposure of NMII TLR surface ligand be think to stimulate the potent activation maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine ie IL and TNFÎ± observe during in vitro infection of DCs Despite the differential activation of human DCs NMI and NMII grow at equal rate in this cell However in vivo this behavior be predict to result in potentiate innate and adaptive immune response to NMII relative to the response to NMI Unlike DCs HMDMs infect by NMI or NMII produce similar amount of proinflammatory cytokine ie TNFÎ± and IL Phase variant also induce similar level of TNFÎ± early after infection of murine PD macrophagelike cell and replicate similarly in this cell In addition to primary human macrophage and DCs NMI and NMII show similar growth characteristic in primary guinea pig macrophage and all continuous cell line examine include murine macrophagelike cell However NMII do have severe growth defect relative to the growth of NMI in primary mouse macrophage NMII activation of the primary mouse macrophage pathogen recognition system by expose TLR ligand may induce production of a cellular effector that limit replication NMI and NMII appear to engage different macrophagemonocyte receptor However in our hand this do not result in different phagosome maturation state or pathogen growth We conclude that infection of primary human macrophage and human macrophagemonocytelike cell line by avirulent NMII represent a physiologically accurate system to model C burnetiihost cell interaction acknowledgment We thank Stacey Gilk

parasporal crystal be toxic on its own but display a unusual kill profile with a high lethal concentration LC than the reference B thuringiensis serovar israelensis crystal protein In addition H have a different toxicity order it be much toxic to Aedes albopictus and Anopheles gambiae than to Culex pipiens Wholegenome sequence and crystal analysis reveal that H can produce novel Cry protein of which be assemble in gene with a orfgaporf organization where orf be a potential Crytype crystallization domain Moreover pH the toxincarrying plasmid hold a wide repertoire of mobile genetic element that amount to ca of its size include novel insertion sequence and class II transposable element Two other large plasmid present in H carry genetic determinant for the production of many interest moleculesâsuch as chitinase cellulase and bacitracinâthat may add up to H bioactive property This paper therefore report a novel mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis strain with unusual Cry toxin gene in a rich mobile DNA environment INTRODUCTION Bacillus cereus sensu lato a diverse group of sporeforming Grampositive bacterium contain nine closely relate species with a wide pathogenicity spectrum but whose exact phylogeny remain a matter of debate â Bacillus thuringiensis a soildwelling bacterium be one of the beststudied member of this group In fact B thuringiensis strain be commercialize and use worldwide as biopesticide in a effort to replace harmful chemical insecticide in the fight against diseasecarrying and phytopathogenic insect Their entomopathogenic capacity be due to a parasporal crystal form during sporulation and consist of Î´endotoxins or Cry sometimes associate with Cyt cytotoxins This crystal be solubilized after ingestion by the alkaline environment of the target larva midgut Cry toxin activate by protease bind to specific receptor localize in the apical microvilli of insect midgut cell This be follow by a oligomerization of the toxin and their insertion into the apical membrane lead to the formation of pore that cause intestinal cell lysis and consequently the death of the insect larva So far the B thuringiensis toxin database set up by Crickmore et al httpswwwbpprcorg encompass family of threedomain have Cry toxin Whereas domain I present a Î±helical structure and be involve in toxin oligomerization and membrane insertion thus pore formation domain II and III have Î²prism and Î²sheet structure respectively and have be find to mediate recognition and interaction with insect gut protein receptor A key feature of all Cry toxin be their receptor specificity The combination of Cry toxin produce by a particular strain determine its host spectrum In contrast Cyt toxin be cytolytic endotoxin that act via nonspecific detergentlike or poreforming model Remarkably Cyt toxin may show significant homology with protein produce by distant microorganism such as volvatoxin A a heatlabile cardiotoxin produce by the straw mushroom Volvariella volvacea as good as other protein find in pathogenic microorganism eg Clostridium kluyveri or Streptomyces venezuelae The combination of various toxin in the same crystal lead to synergistic interaction among Cry toxin or between Cry and Cyt toxin when both be present The synergy can increase toxicity and play against the emergence of resistant insect population This have be observe for instance for the combination of CryA and CryB and for that of CryFa and CryHa Similar observation have be make in the case of B thuringiensis serovar sv israelensis in which CytA help Cry toxin to overcome resistance of Culex quinquefasciatus larva CytA be also find to act as a receptor and anchor for CryAa to increase its toxicity to Aedes aegypti larva and CytA and CytA be show to

within the same genome They include insertion sequence be with a simple organization of two invert repeat flank a transposasecoding gene or much complex element such as class II TEs TEs also include composite transposon with two be flank one or much passenger gene In addition MGEs comprise group II intron which have a complex secondary RNA structure and Bacillus cereus repeat small DNA fragment

of its close relative B cereus sensu stricto Toxincarrying plasmid form up to of the B thuringiensis plasmid pool and toxincoding gene be often associate with transposable element TEs such as be or class II transposable element â B thuringiensis be the basis of many efficient biopesticidal product available on the market eg Vectobac and Monterey Bt Nevertheless the scientific community be always on the lookout for new active B thuringiensis strain produce novel Cry toxin In this study we characterize a new antidipteran B thuringiensis strain isolate from Lebanese soil whose

israelensis plasmid pBtoxis the conserve area be locate from amino acid position to the end of the protein Fig S This high sequence similarity strongly suggest a conserve function with the crystallization domain of Crytype protein which be essential for their inclusion in the parasporal crystal Interestingly the gene encode this protein be locate downstream of that encompass conserve domain with a short intergenic distance max ânt as indicate in Table Moreover the nucleotide sequence of this gap be almost identical especially just before the start codon of orf where the

the conserve Cterminal code part This be in line with a previous study that suggest a common origin for this orf code gene a truncate Cterminal part of a crytype gene that result from a rearrangement lead to a orfgaporf organization In order to confirm that H actually express this cry gene a detail characterization of the protein content of the whole crystal be conduct use nanoliquid

element such as the ISAlike element from the be family be also find on B thuringiensis sv israelensis kb toxin plasmid pBtoxis while other like ISBth from the be family be absent from pBtoxis The much abundant element on pH be the ISBthlike element be family present in copy The abundance of this element and its distribution on pH increase the possibility of form composite transposon with two ISBthlike element flank one or much passenger gene Even though composite transposon be not limit by size that with the close border ISBthlike element and a size under âkb be show in Table S However the two much noteworthy be that where ISBthlike element flank toxincoding gene as highlight in Fig by golden arc on the outermost circle Such be the case for the first transposon with cryBlike the BthIlike group II intron and a Tnlike transposasecoding gene flank by two isoISBth element in opposite orientation The 2 composite transposon include two isoISBth element in the same orientation flank the crylike gene and its downstream orf as good as a phospholipase Ccoding genepH also hold a transposasecoding gene from a potentially new family identify as a PDDEXK nuclease family transposase This superfamily encompass protein with diverse functional niche such as DNA restriction tRNA splice and DNA transposition Although this protein superfamily remain somewhat unexplore in the transposition research field PDDEXK putative transposase have be locate in a numb of microorganism include archaeal and bacterial strain Two new class II transposable element be identify on pH and be designate TnBth and TnBth The former have a characteristic Tn family organization with and bp terminal invert repeat flank transposase and resolvasecoding gene in opposite orientation Fig SA Interestingly a 2 and identical copy of TnBth be present on the kb plasmid pH As for TnBth it hold three code DNA sequence CDSs in the same orientation one of which be a resolvase and the other two seem to belong to a disrupt class II transposase Fig SB this CDSs be flank by and bplong invert repeat Other TEs include the aforementioned BthIlike group II intron originally find in B thuringiensis sv israelensis strain ATCC within a gene code a reverse transcriptase In the case of strain H this element be miss ca âbp at the â² end in comparison with BthI and carry a aminoacid group II intron reverse transcriptasematurase The BthIlike intron be locate between a insecticidal toxincoding gene and a ISBthlike element as mention above without disrupt any cd In addition to this MGEs seven tyrosine recombinaseintegrasecoding gene be distribute on pH They may function independently or in association with other pH mobile elementsOther interest feature In addition to toxin gene and mobile element pH carry two operon contain three and two spore germination proteinencoding gene Fig Moreover pH hold two copy of a gene encode the sporulation initiation inhibitor protein Soj and one abrB gene whose function be to control the transition from vegetative state to sporulation Interestingly a similar situation be observe for pH the large coresident plasmid which harbor several genetic locus relate to spore formation or germination Beside the Cry toxin several noteworthy feature be associate with strain H and can intervene in its interaction with surround environment Many of this feature be carry by the kb megaplasmid pH this include several putative twocomponent system and six ABC transporter system concern antibiotic pH hold potential genetic determinant for fosfomycin resistance and bacitracin and gramicidin S synthesis Strain H also carry gene encode hydrolytic enzyme also refer to as cell walldegrading enzyme cellulase on pH and chitinase on pH and the chromosome Two other type of bioactive molecule siderophores and lassopeptides potentially produce by strain H be encode on the chromosomeDISCUSSION Diptera especially mosquito serve as vector for the transmission of many animal disease such as malaria dengue or yellow fever So far the commonly use method to fight this vectorborne disease be to kill the mosquito with synthetic chemical insecticide However biopesticide much particularly that base on B thuringiensis be slowly but surely take over the insecticide market Nonetheless the need for prevention of potential emergence of resistant strain due to the prolong use of the same combination of toxin in the field have motivate the search and characterization of novel insecticidal strain and toxin In this study a new B thuringiensis strain H isolate from Lebanese soil and active against dipteran larva be characterize for both its insecticidal potential and genomic composition Strain H be toxic for thirdinstar larva of A albopictus C pipiens and A gambiae but at a high dose than the reference B thuringiensis israelensis serovar However H crystal lack Cyt toxin which can explain the observe high dose require for its toxicity interest result be also obtain with the combination of H and be sporecrystal mixture follow which the LT of be be reduce This raise a question regard the nature of the interaction between the crystal toxin of be and H which can be either a additive effect or a synergistic interaction If indeed the observe effect stem from synergy between the toxin of the two strain a 2 question ensue which evoke the identity of the main actor in this interaction from the two strainsâ crystal protein B thuringiensis sv israelensis Cyt toxin be a major component of the crystal and have a key role in its toxicity through their individual and synergistic activity with Cry toxin â In fact thank to their capacity to recognize and interact with the phospholipid of the insect midgut cell Cyt toxin can act as receptor for Cry toxin in case of a shift or to simply increase the numb of receptortoxin interaction This be why Cyt toxin particularly CytA be wellknown key player in the describe synergism in many case with several B thuringiensis Cry toxin â Nonetheless the possibility of synergistic interaction between the Cry toxin of the two strain cannot be exclude Hence three aspect need to be far explore in future experiment which will consist of detail synergistic test between i CytAa and H crystal protein ii CytAa and individually clone H crystal protein and iii pair combination of individually clone H and be crystal protein ie CryAa with CryBlike protein and CryAa with Crylike protein Moreover B thuringiensis sv israelensis be know to be much toxic to Culex than to Aedes and Anopheles larva in contrast to H Since the dose and timedependent kill profile be indication of activity via specific receptor in the insect midgut this lead us to believe that H toxin kill the larva in a different way than what be describe for B thuringiensis sv israelensis In agreement with the observe difference in toxicity between H and the reference B thuringiensis sv israelensis be the crystal protein profile of the former be also completely different from that of the latter In order to get much insight into the genetic and genomics of H entomotoxins a wholegenome sequence approach be use The strain H chromosome appear to be closely relate to the chromosome of B thuringiensis sv sichuansis MC which also display antidipteran activity Moreover H hold three new large plasmid account for almost of its genome hence in size a higherthanaverage plasmid percentage but a low plasmid numb per strain of B thuringiensis plasmid per stain pH the toxincarrying plasmid harbor putative cry gene code for potential parasporal crystal toxin Seven of this protein hold conserve insecticidal domain of which five be place in specific threedomain Cry toxin family display mosquitocidal activity Cry Cry Cry Cry and Cry The remain two protein have Cry H and H do not show enough protein sequence identity with any know Cry family but contain conserve insecticidal domain find in threedomain Cry toxin Table Even though this seven protein have the necessary domain for insecticidal activity it be unclear which one be responsible for H antidipteran activity since this toxin be new and not characterize yet Therefore a much indepth investigation be need for the assessment of the individual toxicity of each protein and the identification of its target receptor in the insect midgut As for the remain four they be designate ORF protein think to be indispensable for correct expression fold and crystallization of the Cry toxin to which they be associate as show by previous study BarbozaCorona et al have indeed show that in the case of the cryA operon ORF enhance the synthesis and crystallization of CryA by function as a Cterminal crystallization domain This be also demonstrate late on for Cry CryB and CryA Another important orfgaporf operon organization be that of B thuringiensis sv israelensis CryAa protein which require ORF for correct crystallization in contrast to CryAa which benefit from the presence of the kDa helper protein p A study by Peng et al suggest that this can be a new evolutionary strategy for B thuringiensis Cry protein and can explain why some Cry protein cannot form crystal when express alone in a acrystalliferous strain Interestingly though in the case of H four toxin gene adopt the orfgaporf organization pH be also quite unusual for the abundance of TEs include much than be and class II element a group II intron and several potential composite transposon For comparison the large coresident pH plasmid âkb hold only eight be element belong to three family be ISIS and be Toxincarrying plasmid in B thuringiensis be no stranger to TEs since they hold a good proportion of the total plasmidial be Tnlike element and group II intron As previously mention several TEs be find to be associate with toxincoding gene eg be and when active to shuffle the cry gene within the bacterial genome and also among strain in the case of conjugationmobilization event Of notice however be the of pH occupy by TEs a figure much high than the average of for toxincarrying plasmid and the for the B thuringiensis sv israelensis pBtoxis plasmid This be also much high than the ISTnlike element proportion of pH and pH TE prevalence in toxincarrying plasmid compare to other plasmid may underline a evolutionary adaptation mechanism due to their contribution to the diversity of B thuringiensis virulence and its insect host spectrum Not only be toxincarrying plasmid important for the ecological function of B thuringiensis but also they play key role in other cellular function such as sporulationgermination Some study have suggest that this plasmid be the define genomic entity for the recognition of a strain as a member of the B thuringiensis species although in some rare case cry gene be find on the chromosome surround by be element a possible reason for their mobility from plasmid to chromosome Another aspect of H toxicity bring to light by the wholegenome sequence be a group of bioactive molecule possibly produce by H Many of this molecule be encode by pH They include bacitracin and gramicidin S cyclic nonribosomal peptide mostly active against Grampositive bacterium In addition H like other B thuringiensis strain potentially produce chitinase a enzyme with great potential as a agent for biocontrol of pathogenic fungus and as a add value to the insecticidal activity thank to the degradation of chitin laminate the intestinal peritrophic membrane copy of the chitinase gene be find on the H chromosome as good as pH The H chromosome also carry cluster for two other potential bioactive molecule siderophores ironscavenging molecule that may act as biocontrol agent by chelate iron and reduce its bioavailability and lassopeptides ribosomally synthesize and posttranslationally modify peptide RiPPs with a unique dimensional structure and a wide spectrum of antimicrobial and analgesic activity In conclusion H be a interest B thuringiensis strain with a new plasmidial content include a wide MGE repertoire within pH the toxincarrying plasmid The novelty of H Cry protein with their different kill profile be encourage for their potential use in the field as coformulants to the classic antidipteran strain Nevertheless this finding also raise several issue that pave the way for future study such as the individual toxicity of each of this new toxin and the identification of the receptor to which they bind the role of ORF in the expression and correct fold of its associate protein and finally the potential activity and effect of TEs within the toxincarrying plasmid pHMATERIALS AND method Bacterial strain B thuringiensis sv israelensis be isolate from the commercial sample Vectobac Sumi tomo be our reference strain It be kindly provide by

of interest IMPORTANCE Bacillus thuringiensis a soil entomopathogenic bacterium be at the base of many sustainable ecofriendly bioinsecticides Hence stem the need to continually characterize insecticidal toxin H be a antidipteran B thuringiensis strain isolate from Lebanese soil whose parasporal crystal contain novel Cry toxin and no Cyt toxin In addition to its individual activity H show potential as a coformulant with classic commercialize B thuringiensis product to delay the emergence of resistance and to shorten the time require for kill On a genomic level H hold three large plasmid one of which carry the toxincoding gene with four occurrence of the distinct orfgaporf organization Moreover this plasmid be extremely rich in mobile genetic element unlike its two coresidents This highlight the important underlie evolutionary trait between toxincarrying plasmid and the adaptation of a B thuringiensis strain to its environment and insect host spectrum INTRODUCTION Bacillus cereus sensu lato a diverse group of sporeforming Grampositive bacterium contain nine closely relate species with a wide pathogenicity spectrum but whose exact phylogeny remain a matter of debate â Bacillus thuringiensis a soildwelling bacterium be one of the beststudied member of this group In fact B thuringiensis strain be commercialize and use worldwide as biopesticide in a effort to replace harmful chemical insecticide in the fight against diseasecarrying and phytopathogenic insect Their entomopathogenic capacity be due to a parasporal crystal form during sporulation and consist of Î´endotoxins or Cry sometimes associate with Cyt cytotoxins This crystal be solubilized after ingestion by the alkaline environment of the target larva midgut Cry toxin activate by protease bind to specific receptor localize in the apical microvilli of insect midgut cell This be follow by a oligomerization of the toxin and their insertion into the apical membrane lead to the formation of pore that cause intestinal cell lysis and consequently the death of the insect larva So far the B thuringiensis toxin database set up by Crickmore et al httpswwwbpprcorg encompass family of threedomain have Cry toxin Whereas domain I present a Î±helical structure and be involve in toxin oligomerization and membrane insertion thus pore formation domain II and III have Î²prism and Î²sheet structure respectively and have be find to mediate recognition and interaction with insect gut protein receptor A key feature of all Cry toxin be their receptor specificity The combination of Cry toxin produce by a particular strain determine its host spectrum In contrast Cyt toxin be cytolytic endotoxin that act via nonspecific detergentlike or poreforming model Remarkably Cyt toxin may show significant homology with protein produce by distant microorganism such as volvatoxin A a heatlabile cardiotoxin produce by the straw mushroom Volvariella volvacea as good as other protein find in pathogenic microorganism eg Clostridium kluyveri or Streptomyces venezuelae The combination of various toxin in the same crystal lead to synergistic interaction among Cry toxin or between Cry and Cyt toxin when both be present The synergy can increase toxicity and play against the emergence of resistant insect population This have be observe for instance for the combination of CryA and CryB and for that of CryFa and CryHa Similar observation have be make in the case of B thuringiensis serovar sv israelensis in which CytA help Cry toxin to overcome resistance of Culex quinquefasciatus larva CytA be also find to act as a receptor and anchor for CryAa to increase its toxicity to Aedes aegypti larva and CytA and CytA be show to synergize CryB toxin at a ratio as low as in the mix B thuringiensis sv israelensis be a example of a highly effective combination of toxin It be the reference for antidipteran activity to which no resistance have be observe in the field despite its long usage as a biocontrol agent due to the mix of Cry toxin as good as the presence of the Cyt toxin Its crystal be compose of CryAa CryBa CryAa CryAa CytAa and CytBa with Cyt be the major component this toxinencoding gene be locate on the kb toxincarrying plasmid pBtoxis plasmid be part of the repertoire of mobile genetic element MGEs of each strain Some of this extrachromosomal entity can be conjugative mobilizable or of prophagelike nature Another group of MGEs be transposable element TEs which can move from one location to another within the same genome They include insertion sequence be with a simple organization of two invert repeat flank a transposasecoding gene or much complex element such as class II TEs TEs also include composite transposon with two be flank one or much passenger gene In addition MGEs comprise group II intron which have a complex secondary RNA structure and Bacillus cereus repeat small DNA fragment find only in the B cereus group In this group the occurrence and distribution of MGE type and family vary greatly among its member as have recently be show plasmid much specifically that carry toxin genetic determinant be key element of the ecology and adaptation of B cereus sensu lato species especially in the case of B thuringiensis whose plasmid percentage of the genome be time high than that of its close relative B cereus sensu stricto Toxincarrying plasmid form up to of the B thuringiensis plasmid pool and toxincoding gene be often associate with transposable element TEs such as be or class II transposable element â B thuringiensis be the basis of many efficient biopesticidal product available on the market eg Vectobac and Monterey Bt Nevertheless the scientific community be always on the lookout for new active B thuringiensis strain produce novel Cry toxin In this study we characterize a new antidipteran B thuringiensis strain isolate from Lebanese soil whose sporecrystal mixture lack Cyt toxin and display a novel in vivo kill profile We have also find that this H strain harbor a plethora of mobile genetic element often associate with the entomotoxin genetic determinantsRESULTS Bacterial strain and bioassay B thuringiensis strain H be isolate from a soil sample from the region of Harissa Lebanon This strain produce a round parasporal crystal In a effort to find new antidipteran B thuringiensis strain the H crystalspore mixture be test against thirdinstar larva of Aedes albopictus Culex pipiens and Anopheles gambiae Initial survival test be perform use five crystal protein concentration and âÎ¼gml H be noticeably little toxic to Culex than to Anopheles and Aedes Table and Fig with lethal concentration LC value after h of âÂ±â âÂ±â and âÂ±â Âµgml respectively As show in Fig for a Î´endotoxin concentration of âÂµgml the survival rate be ca for C pipiens larva after h compare to and for A gambiae and A albopictus respectively As for the reference strain B thuringiensis sv israelensis be the LC value calculate h min postinfection for Culex h min postinfection for Anopheles and h postinfection for Aedes be âÂ±â âÂ±â and âÂ±â ngml respectively While be show the high activity against Culex this be not the case for H which be much toxic to Aedes larva on which additional bioassay be conduct Thirdinstar A albopictus larva be expose to various combination of H and be sporecrystal mixture at a final concentration of âÂµgml of toxin Subsequently the lethal time LT of the combination and that be sporecrystal mixture alone be compare The combination of H and be result in a reduction of the be LT via a potential additive effect for all test combination with vary proportion of the sporecrystal mixture see Fig S in the supplemental material For instance in a comparison of the ratio of H to be to be alone at a ratio of the total Âµgml concentration ie at âÂµgml the observe LT be ca instead of âmin The Cry toxin composition of strain H be then assess for its protein profile which be compare to that of be The two strain do not share any protein band reflect their different crystal composition Fig Moreover PCR screen of gene encode know antidipteran Cry protein CryAB Cry and Cry be negative with only a partial segment of the â² end of the cryB gene amplify with DipADipB primer take together this result strongly suggest that strain H produce new antidipteran toxin PCR with gene encode Cyt toxin CytA and CytB be also negative mean that H contrary to classic antidipteran strain do not produce that Cyt toxin Moreover wash solubilized

the end of the protein Fig S This high sequence similarity strongly suggest a conserve function with the crystallization domain of Crytype protein which be essential for their inclusion in the parasporal crystal Interestingly the gene encode this protein be locate downstream of that encompass conserve domain with a short intergenic distance max ânt as indicate in Table Moreover the

this element be miss ca âbp at the â² end in comparison with BthI and carry a aminoacid group II intron reverse transcriptasematurase The BthIlike intron be locate between a insecticidal toxincoding gene and a ISBthlike element as mention above without disrupt any cd In addition to this MGEs seven tyrosine recombinaseintegrasecoding gene be distribute on pH They may function independently or in association with other pH mobile elementsOther interest feature In addition to toxin gene and mobile element pH carry two operon contain three and two spore germination proteinencoding gene Fig Moreover pH hold two copy of a gene encode the sporulation initiation inhibitor protein Soj and one abrB gene whose function be to control the transition from vegetative state to sporulation Interestingly a similar situation be observe for pH the large coresident plasmid which harbor several genetic locus relate to spore formation or germination Beside the Cry toxin several noteworthy feature be associate with strain H and can intervene in its interaction with surround environment Many of this feature be carry by the kb megaplasmid pH this include several putative twocomponent system and six ABC transporter system concern antibiotic pH hold potential genetic determinant for fosfomycin resistance and bacitracin and gramicidin S synthesis Strain H also carry gene encode hydrolytic enzyme also refer to as cell walldegrading enzyme cellulase on pH and chitinase on pH and the chromosome Two other type of bioactive molecule siderophores and lassopeptides potentially produce by strain H be encode on the chromosomeDISCUSSION Diptera especially mosquito serve as vector for the transmission of many animal disease such as malaria dengue or yellow fever So far the commonly use method to fight this vectorborne disease be to kill the mosquito with synthetic chemical insecticide However biopesticide much particularly that base on B thuringiensis be slowly but surely take over the insecticide market Nonetheless the need for prevention of potential emergence of resistant strain due to the prolong use of the same combination of toxin in the field have motivate the search and characterization of novel insecticidal strain and toxin In this study a new B thuringiensis strain H isolate from Lebanese soil and active against dipteran larva be characterize for both its insecticidal potential and genomic composition Strain H be toxic for thirdinstar larva of A albopictus C pipiens and A gambiae but at a high dose than the reference B thuringiensis israelensis serovar However H crystal lack Cyt toxin which can explain the observe high dose require for its toxicity interest result be also obtain with the combination of H and be sporecrystal mixture follow which the LT of be be reduce This raise a question regard the nature of the interaction between the crystal toxin of be and H which can be either a additive effect or a synergistic interaction If indeed the observe effect stem from synergy between the toxin of the two strain a 2 question ensue which evoke the identity of the main actor in this interaction from the two strainsâ crystal protein B thuringiensis sv israelensis Cyt toxin be a major component of the crystal and have a key role in its toxicity through their individual and synergistic activity with Cry toxin â In fact thank to their capacity to recognize and interact with the phospholipid of the insect midgut cell Cyt toxin can act as receptor for Cry toxin in case of a shift or to simply increase the numb of receptortoxin interaction This be why Cyt toxin particularly CytA be wellknown key player in the describe synergism in many case with several B thuringiensis Cry toxin â Nonetheless the possibility of synergistic interaction between the Cry toxin of the two strain cannot be exclude Hence three aspect need to be far explore in future experiment which will consist of detail synergistic test between i CytAa and H crystal protein ii CytAa and individually clone H crystal protein and iii pair combination of individually clone H and be crystal protein ie CryAa with CryBlike protein and CryAa with Crylike protein Moreover B thuringiensis sv israelensis be know to be much toxic to Culex than to Aedes and Anopheles larva in contrast to H Since the dose and timedependent kill profile be indication of activity via specific receptor in the insect midgut this lead us to believe that H toxin kill the larva in a different way than what be describe for B thuringiensis sv israelensis In agreement with the observe difference in toxicity between H and the reference B thuringiensis sv israelensis be the crystal protein profile of the former be also completely different from that of the latter In order to get much insight into the genetic and genomics of H entomotoxins a wholegenome sequence approach be use The strain H chromosome appear to be closely relate to the chromosome of B thuringiensis sv sichuansis MC which also display antidipteran activity Moreover H hold three new large plasmid account for almost of its genome hence in size a higherthanaverage plasmid percentage but a low plasmid numb per strain of B thuringiensis plasmid per stain pH the toxincarrying plasmid harbor putative cry gene code for potential parasporal crystal toxin Seven of this protein hold conserve insecticidal domain of which five be place in specific threedomain Cry toxin family display mosquitocidal activity Cry Cry Cry Cry and Cry The remain two protein have Cry H and H do not show enough protein sequence identity with any know Cry family but contain conserve insecticidal domain find in threedomain Cry toxin Table Even though this seven protein have the necessary domain for insecticidal activity it be unclear which one be responsible for H antidipteran activity since this toxin be new and not characterize yet Therefore a much indepth investigation be need for the assessment of the individual toxicity of each protein and the identification of its target receptor in the insect midgut As for the remain four they be designate ORF protein think to be indispensable for correct expression fold and crystallization of the Cry toxin to which they be associate as show by previous study BarbozaCorona et al have indeed show that in the case of the cryA operon ORF enhance the synthesis and crystallization of CryA by function as a Cterminal crystallization domain This be also demonstrate late on for Cry CryB and CryA Another important orfgaporf operon organization be that of B thuringiensis sv israelensis CryAa protein which require ORF for correct crystallization in contrast to CryAa which benefit from the presence of the kDa helper protein p A study by Peng et al suggest that this can be a new evolutionary strategy for B thuringiensis Cry protein and can explain why some Cry protein cannot form crystal when express alone in a acrystalliferous strain Interestingly though in the case of H four toxin gene adopt the orfgaporf organization pH be also quite unusual for the abundance of TEs include much than be and class II element a group II intron and several potential composite transposon For comparison the large coresident pH plasmid âkb hold only eight be element belong to three family be ISIS and be Toxincarrying plasmid in B thuringiensis be no stranger to TEs since they hold a good proportion of the total plasmidial be Tnlike element and group II intron As previously mention several TEs be find to be associate with toxincoding gene eg be and when active to shuffle the cry gene within the bacterial genome and also among strain in the case of conjugationmobilization event Of notice however be the of pH occupy by TEs a figure much high than the average of for toxincarrying plasmid and the for the B thuringiensis sv israelensis pBtoxis plasmid This be also much high than the ISTnlike element proportion of pH and pH TE prevalence in toxincarrying plasmid compare to other plasmid may underline a evolutionary adaptation mechanism due to their contribution to the diversity of B thuringiensis virulence and its insect host spectrum Not only be toxincarrying plasmid important for the ecological function of B thuringiensis but also they play key role in other cellular function such as sporulationgermination Some study have suggest that this plasmid be the define genomic entity for the recognition of a strain as a member of the B thuringiensis species although in some rare case cry gene be find on the chromosome surround by be element a possible reason for their mobility from plasmid to chromosome Another aspect of H toxicity bring to light by the wholegenome sequence be a group of bioactive molecule possibly produce by H Many of this molecule be encode by pH They include bacitracin and gramicidin S cyclic nonribosomal peptide mostly active against Grampositive bacterium In addition H like other B thuringiensis strain potentially produce chitinase a enzyme with great potential as a agent for biocontrol of pathogenic fungus and as a add value to the insecticidal activity thank to the degradation of chitin laminate the intestinal peritrophic membrane copy of the chitinase gene be find on the H chromosome as good as pH The H chromosome also carry cluster for two other potential bioactive molecule siderophores ironscavenging molecule that may act as biocontrol agent by chelate iron and reduce its bioavailability and lassopeptides ribosomally synthesize and posttranslationally modify peptide RiPPs with a unique dimensional structure and a wide spectrum of antimicrobial and analgesic activity In conclusion H be a interest B thuringiensis strain with a new plasmidial content include a wide MGE repertoire within pH the toxincarrying plasmid The novelty of H Cry protein with their different kill profile be encourage for their potential use in the field as coformulants to the classic antidipteran strain Nevertheless this finding also raise several issue that pave the way for future study such as the individual toxicity of each of this new toxin and the identification of the receptor to which they bind the role of ORF in the expression and correct fold of its associate protein and finally the potential activity and effect of TEs within the toxincarrying plasmid pHMATERIALS AND method Bacterial strain B thuringiensis sv israelensis be isolate from the commercial sample Vectobac Sumi tomo be our reference strain It be kindly provide by

interval CIââ to would have become infect with at much of them require hospitalization Our scalable and transferable surveillance plan meet its primary objective and represent a powerful example of a innovative public health initiative dovetail with scientific discovery INTRODUCTION The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV and the associate coronavirus disease COVID have precipitate a global pandemic heavily challenge our social behavior economy and health care infrastructure Worldwide recovery from this active devastate outbreak cannot begin until safe and effective medicine for treatment and prevention be available and accessible globally In the interim it be essential to use the rapidly expand scientific knowledge on the novel SARSCoV to update guideline for COVID patient management as good as protection of the uninfected population The implementation of social distance frequent and thorough hand wash isolation and the use of face covering have help curb the incidence of COVID in many part of the unite state and this measure continue to be important until high vaccination rate have be achieve Our ability to design and introduce effective public health measure to reduce the spread of COVID rely on a understand of the viral pathogenesis and dynamic fundamental aspect of the disease that remain largely unknown Workplace SARSCoV transmission be believe to represent a important contributor to the global COVID pandemic especially as country attempt to spur economic activity In a significant proportion of infect individual the disease manifest itself with mild or no symptom and manage asymptomatic carrier socalled âsilent spreadersâ represent a significant challenge in control the pandemic This concern be heighten by finding suggest that SARSCoV transmission rate be similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic infect individual â Workplace transmission from SARSCoV carrier with mild or no symptom therefore be a potentially important mode of spread the highly communicable disease and represent a significant occupational health risk infect worker subsequently be susceptible to transmit the virus far to household member When workplace COVID acquisition occur standard protective measure require all employee who have be in contact with the infect individual to selfquarantine for âweeks This can effectively close unit and business even though a proportion of the isolate worker may not have contract the virus base on this rationale the development and assessment of measure to effectively control SARSCoV transmission in the workplace be highly significant and necessary to provide a safe occupational environment In a May interview James W Curran Dean Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University state âAccurate surveillance be the conscience and guidepost for public healthâ The current clinical study build on this foundational principle and consist of longitudinal and intensive characterization of COVID prevalence and incidence at the Oak Crest Institute of Science Oak Crest a nonprofit science research organization in Southern California The two primary study objective be to i characterize the rate of COVID acquisition in a small cohort of worker interact on a daily basis in the workplace and ii determine the utility of this datum in manage workplace COVID exposure minimize far spread as per public health advisory Exploratory aim include characterize SARSCoV transmission between Oak Crest employee and their household member and measure the viral dynamic

protocol and other be add base on practical consideration While work on site at Oak Crest all individual practice social distance and hand hygiene and wear face covering when in close proximity to other employee on monday see below test negate the need for mandatory face mask on other day Outside of work employee and their household member be encourage to strictly adhere to current public health advisory regard gather in group wear face covering and social distance participant who test positive for SARSCoV RNA receive referral for test and recommendation eg selfquarantine base on the current prefer public health requirement Symptomatic participant even if test negative for SARSCoV RNA by RTqPCR would have be ask to return home none be report in the study selfquarantine at a minimum until symptom resolve and contact their health care provider about confirmatory clinical test and symptom management participant test positive for SARSCoV even if asymptomatic be inform as soon as possible and ask to go home selfquarantine and contact their health care provider or the Department of Public Health DPH about confirmatory test treatment and quarantine recommendation participant also be give educational information to guide other household member of potential risk and some of their option Any employee who be ask to selfquarantine or do not choose to participate in the study work remotely as much as possible and continue to receive full pay participant who test negative and obtain a subsequent invalid test result be ask to wear protective face cover surgical mask be provide by Oak Crest if need until they can be retest Initially participant who test negative and obtain a subsequent inconclusive test result be send home immediately and tell to selfquarantine until they can be retest ie new swab sample collect and analyze As the study progress that protocol be modify to be the same as for a invalid result ie the employee be ask to wear protective face cover rather than be send home for selfquarantine assume that previous test result be negative The long period between test be Friday to the follow Monday day start in May all employee be require to wear protective mask on Monday morning until the test result be finalize and communicate The same procedure be institute for day weekend when there be a additional day between test employee who miss day of test be require to wear a protective mask until they be retest employee who miss much than day of test be permit to reenter the facility only after a new sample test negativeDISCUSSION The current ongoing clinical study have two primary aim i to characterize the rate of SARSCoV acquisition in a small cohort of participant interact on a daily basis in the workplace and ii to determine the ability of this datum to manage workplace SARSCoV exposure and consequence minimize far spread as per public health advisory Workplace study participant include staff student and volunteer researcher refer to as âemployeesâ Family member and housemate also be recruit lead to a subcohort refer to as âhousehold membersâ relate exploratory study goal include

assay limit of detection LLD for of the measure antiSARSCoV monoclonal antibody IgM and IgG However antireceptor bind domain protein antiRBD IgA concentration be detectable in all sample and decay rapidly halflife t day FigÂ B It be become increasingly evident base on literature report that a significant proportion of individual with positive SARSCoV RTqPCR result remain asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic â yet still contagious However ours be the first report on longitudinal analysis of a asymptomatic individual who maintain low SARSCoV RNA copy number and do not appear to trigger a traditional host immune response This result be not entirely unexpected as antibody response be not detectable in all COVID patient especially that who experience lowgrade symptom One household member subject be symptomatic and clinically diagnose with COVID by RTqPCR and begin participate in the study during convalescence after symptom resolve FigÂ A The subject develop a robust immune response in term of antiSARSCoV IgM IgG and IgA serum concentration TableÂ and FigÂ that persist for over year from the onset of symptom allow decay halflives for all three antibody type to be calculate The intense longitudinal RNA sample provide a rare insight into the viral dynamic of a individual recover from COVID over a month time frame Subject remain positive for viral RNA for at less âdays one of the long period of SARSCoV shed report at that time Little be know about this potential subpopulation of individual with persistent longterm viral recalcitrance Intermittent news report suggest that some convalesce COVID patient who have test negative for SARSCoV RNA by RTqPCR may retest positive late in recovery prompt speculation that some individual be vulnerable to reinfection other hypothesize that positive retest be the result of noninfectious residual viral fragment Unfortunately many of this report be anecdotal and not scientifically control Scientific study on the allege SARSCoV reinfection phenomenon be scarce There be isolate case report describe a situation in which a single COVID patient be discharge in part because of two consecutive negative SARSCoV RTqPCR clinical result but retest positive for SARSCoV RNA during convalescence â include a yearold woman who test positive for âdays from the onset of symptom âdays from her first positive test Other account detail similar result for small cohort of or much individual In a clinical study involve patient who recover from COVID retest positive for viral RNA in stool sample during convalescence A cohort of COVID patient be retest by RTqPCR little than âdays after selfreported symptom resolution Eleven subject be still diagnose as positive by RTqPCR at a median of âdays range to âdays a et al follow COVID patient for âweeks follow discharge and find that test positive for SARSCoV RNA suggest that this subset may be carrier of the virus In a similar study Huang et al find that out of recover COVID patient discharge and subsequently quarantine retest positive for SARSCoV with readmission and with readmission suggest that in some case the virus be replication competent The abovementioned case be distinct from socalled âlonghaul COVIDâ in which patient who recover from the acute phase of COVID continue to experience symptom for long period âdays All Oak Crest employee with the exception of subject remain negative for SARSCoV RNA over the course of the month study In our hand the RTqPCR appear to provide reliable result with no know false positive or negative With the exception of subject and inconclusive measurement ie only one of the two oligonucleotide probe target the viral nucleocapsid protein gene transcript fragment meet the assay threshold for positivity make up a small fraction of the test result We contend that in the context of a person develop or recover from COVID infection inconclusive SARSCoV RNA measurement can define the transition phase between positive and negative as support by FigÂ keep in mind datum publish regard the potential reinfectivity of SARSCoV subject and be continuously retest even follow occasion where subject receive consecutive negative result scatter inconclusive result accompany day of high CT value for subject and provide insight into the potential for reinfection and speak to the sensitivity of our assay This study be especially useful in distinguish between case that appear to be true reinfection and that that can be classify by the transition from a positive to a negative result Unexpectedly of employee test positive for antiSARSCoV antibody mostly IgM at baseline between March and April TableÂ suggest possible exposure to the virus prior to the start of the clinical study Many of this participant report suffer from symptom consistent with COVIDâthought to be a virulent flu strain at the timeâin the first half of February However none of this serum sample have detectable concentration of IgG which have the long halflife of the three measure virusspecific antibody FigÂ The finding remain unexplained and can be due to crossreactivity in the IgM assay Subject a selfquarantined employee who have just recover from suspect COVID base on symptomology at the start of the study repeatedly test negative for SARSCoV RNA but test positive for IgM antibody that rapidly decline t day FigÂ A No IgG or IgA antibody be detect in serum sample from this participant There be some caveat to interpret our antibody datum We measure only IgM IgG and IgA against RBD and not the whole spike or E protein as discuss in much detail elsewhere The IgM assay be subject to great uncertainty than the IgA and IgG assay at low concentration ca âÎ¼g mlâ or low and result need to be interpret with caution However all serum sample be analyze at three level of dilution and and only detectable concentration in at less of the dilute sample be report The clinical study describe here have meet its goal to date by provide a safe work environment for employee of a small academic institute at a time when the unite state be experience alarm expansion of the pandemic The test model constitute a validate practical framework that can be adopt by other small organization for this and future respiratory virus pandemic The ability to perform routine frequent COVID test not only have allow us to responsibly maintain a productive work environment during the pandemic but also have provide continuous reassure datum for the participate household many include vulnerable individual This have the important mental health benefit of reduce anxiety and provide a sense of normalcy in the workplace ie safe zone during a acutely stressful period The clinical studyâs success in prevent workplace SARSCoV transmission can be assess through a predictive analysis model local study impact predict that without our intervention up to employee or household contact can have become infect with SARSCoV by July Our find that only two subject contract COVID one prior to the start of the study suggest that workplace disease surveillance base on frequent longitudinal test combine with recommend public health practice social distance frequent hand sanitize and mask wear on select day when feasible can be effective at create a safe zone or bubble prevent COVID from enter into the workplace Our simulation predict a important local public health benefit from our scalable surveillance plan Similar approach be adopt subsequently in the summer of by professional sport league eg the National Hockey League the entertainment industry and other to support responsible resumption of their activity The study also generate important new scientific datum on the SARSCoV host

of SARSCoV and the associate COVID have precipitate a global pandemic heavily challenge our social behavior economy and health care infrastructure In the absence of widespread worldwide access to safe and effective vaccine and therapeutics public health measure represent a key intervention for curb the devastate impact from the pandemic We be conduct a ongoing clinical study base on frequent longitudinal workplace disease surveillance to control SARSCoV transmission among employee and their household member Our study be successful in survey the viral and immune response dynamic in two participant with unusual infection one remain positive for SARSCoV for âdays while the other be asymptomatic with low associate viral RNA copy number A COVID infection model be use to predict that without surveillance intervention up to employee would have become infect with at much of them require hospitalization underscore the importance of our program INTRODUCTION The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV and the associate coronavirus disease COVID have precipitate a global pandemic heavily challenge our social behavior economy and health care infrastructure Worldwide recovery from this active devastate outbreak cannot begin until safe and effective medicine for treatment and prevention be available and accessible globally In the interim it be essential to use the rapidly expand scientific knowledge on the novel SARSCoV to update guideline for COVID patient management as good as protection of the uninfected population The implementation of social distance frequent and thorough hand wash isolation and the use of face covering have help curb the incidence of COVID in many part of the unite state and this measure continue to be important until high vaccination rate have be achieve Our ability to design and introduce effective public health measure to reduce the spread of COVID rely on a understand of the viral pathogenesis and dynamic fundamental aspect of the disease that remain largely unknown Workplace SARSCoV transmission be believe to represent a important contributor to the global COVID pandemic especially as country attempt to spur economic activity In a significant proportion of infect individual the disease manifest itself with mild or no symptom and manage asymptomatic carrier socalled âsilent spreadersâ represent a significant challenge in control the pandemic This concern be heighten by finding suggest that SARSCoV transmission rate be similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic infect individual â Workplace transmission from SARSCoV carrier with mild or no symptom therefore be a potentially important mode of spread the highly communicable disease and represent a significant occupational health risk infect worker subsequently be susceptible to transmit the virus far to household member When workplace COVID acquisition occur standard protective measure require all employee who have be in contact with the infect individual to selfquarantine for âweeks This can effectively close unit and business even though a proportion of the isolate worker may not have contract the virus base on this rationale the development and assessment of measure to effectively control SARSCoV transmission in the workplace be highly significant and necessary to provide a safe occupational environment In a May interview James W Curran Dean Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University state âAccurate surveillance be the conscience and guidepost for public healthâ The current clinical study build on this foundational principle and consist of longitudinal and intensive characterization of COVID prevalence and incidence at the Oak Crest Institute of Science Oak Crest a nonprofit science research organization in Southern California The two primary study objective be to i characterize the rate of COVID acquisition in a small cohort of worker interact on a daily basis in the workplace and ii determine the utility of this datum in manage workplace COVID exposure minimize far spread as per public health advisory Exploratory aim include characterize SARSCoV transmission between Oak Crest employee and their household member and measure the viral dynamic in infect individual from the study cohortRESULTS Study participant A total of subject participate in the study over the first month Oak Crest employee student and volunteer and household member Retention of study subject be The correspond demographics be present in TableÂ Sample collection efficiency The majority of clinical specimen consist of nasal swab sample Only of the participant can not tolerate the nasal swab procedure and selfcollected oral sample instead A total of sample be analyze in the month study FigureÂ compare the distribution of RP gene transcript cycle threshold CT value ie indication of host RNA recover for the nasal nââ and oral nââ sample The median interquartile

falsepositive result from the reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR RTqPCR measurement The low limit of detection of the SARSCoV N gene transcript fragment RTqPCR assay be RNA copy per reaction All positive result be confirm by retest on multiple successive occasion see below Any falsenegative result would need to have be for asymptomatic individual who do not infect other employee or household member A probabilistic analysis on a employee with consecutive falsenegative result afford a P valueâof P Ã â assume a sensitivity and specificity If sensitivity analysis be to reduce the sensitivity and specificity to for both the upper probability bind over the same prevalence rate for consecutive falsenegative result be a Pâvalue ofâ Ã â The probability bind for a participant to have consecutive falsenegative result calculate over a wide range of prevalence value to be a Pâvalue of There be invalid measurement in the first three study day attribute to lack of familiarity with the sample protocol and therefore this be not include in the analysis a additional invalid sample be obtain during the remain study period account for of total measurement There be a total of inconclusive measurement over the course of the study with the follow caveat the inconclusive result do not include that obtain for the participant who test positive for SARSCoV RNA see below nor do they include inconclusive result obtain on study day and June for participant who repeatedly test negative for SARSCoV RNA The high numb of inconclusive measurement obtain on that consecutive sample day be attribute to reagent trace contaminant that result in erroneous high CT value ie low RNA copy numb equivalent background noise for amplicon obtain with the N or N primerPositive participant RTqPCR result Two participant be find to be positive for SARSCoV RNA over the course of the study FigÂ In the participantâs clinical diary subject age over âyears far demographics not disclose for the purpose of confidentiality describe potential SARSCoV exposure on March with the onset of COVID symptom on March that persist until March During that period the participant be selfisolated without hospitalization and on April the participant test positive for SARSCoV by a clinical RTqPCR oral swab On April the participant enroll in our clinical study The last nasal swab test that meet the CDC criterion for a positive result be on May indicate that the participant be COVID positive for at less âdays March to May Oral April and stool and April sample be negative for SARSCoV RNA Subject age over âyears far demographics not disclose for the purpose of confidentiality be a employee who access the facility only once per week and therefore be test weekly The test result go from negative up to May to positive for SARSCoV RNA May and remain positive for day until May The participant be asymptomatic during that period Saliva and May and stool and May sample be either negative or inconclusive for SARSCoV RNASerological test result A total of serum sample collect between March and May be analyze for virusspecific IgM IgG and IgA concentration as describe above The result be

March and on July in Los Angeles County give employee and household contact with the demographic characteristic of the participant TableÂ from the current study and without surveillance intervention the model produce a expectation that up to employee confidence interval CIââ to would have become infect with at much of them require hospitalization and death The lack of death stem from the population demographic tend toward young person and improve inhospital treatment procedure at the time of writingPractical study consideration A numb of policy and procedure be institute during the study as describe below Some be part of the original protocol and other be add base on practical consideration While work on site at Oak Crest all individual practice social distance and hand hygiene and wear face covering when in close proximity to other employee on monday see below test negate the need for mandatory face mask on other day Outside of work employee and their household member be encourage to strictly adhere to current public health advisory regard gather in group wear face covering and social distance participant who test positive for SARSCoV RNA receive referral for test and recommendation eg selfquarantine base on the current prefer public health requirement Symptomatic participant even if test negative for SARSCoV RNA by RTqPCR would have be ask to return home none be report in the study selfquarantine at a minimum until symptom resolve and contact their health care provider about confirmatory clinical test and symptom management participant test positive for SARSCoV even if asymptomatic be inform as soon as possible and ask to go home selfquarantine and contact their health care provider or the Department of Public Health DPH about confirmatory test treatment and quarantine recommendation participant also be give educational information to guide other household member of potential risk and some of their option Any employee who be ask to selfquarantine or do not choose to participate in the study work remotely as much as possible and continue to receive full pay participant who test negative and obtain a subsequent invalid test result be ask to wear protective face cover surgical mask be provide by Oak Crest if need until they can be retest Initially participant who test negative and obtain a subsequent inconclusive test result be send home immediately and tell to selfquarantine until they can be retest ie new swab sample collect and analyze As the study progress that protocol be modify to be the same as for a invalid result ie the employee be ask to wear protective face cover rather than be send home for selfquarantine assume that previous test result be negative The long period between test be Friday to the follow Monday day start in May all employee be require to wear protective mask on Monday morning until the test result be finalize and communicate The same procedure be institute for day weekend when there be a additional day between test employee who miss day of test be require to wear a protective mask until they be retest employee who miss much than day of test be permit to reenter the facility only after a new sample test negativeDISCUSSION The current ongoing clinical study have two primary aim i to characterize the rate of SARSCoV acquisition in a small cohort of participant interact on a daily basis in the workplace and ii to determine the ability of this datum to manage workplace SARSCoV exposure and consequence minimize far spread as per public health advisory Workplace study participant include staff student and volunteer researcher refer to as âemployeesâ Family member and housemate also be recruit lead to a subcohort refer to as âhousehold membersâ relate exploratory study

assay limit of detection LLD for of the measure antiSARSCoV monoclonal antibody IgM and IgG However antireceptor bind domain protein antiRBD IgA concentration be detectable in all sample and decay rapidly halflife t day FigÂ B It be become increasingly evident base on literature report that a significant proportion of individual with positive SARSCoV RTqPCR result remain asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic â yet still contagious However ours be the first report on longitudinal analysis of a asymptomatic individual who maintain low SARSCoV RNA copy number and do not appear to trigger a traditional host immune response This result be not entirely unexpected as antibody response be not detectable in all COVID patient especially that who experience lowgrade symptom One household member subject be symptomatic and clinically diagnose with COVID by RTqPCR and begin participate in the study during convalescence after symptom resolve FigÂ A The subject develop a robust immune response in term of antiSARSCoV IgM IgG and IgA serum concentration TableÂ and FigÂ that persist for over year from the onset of symptom allow decay halflives for all three antibody type to be calculate The intense longitudinal RNA sample provide a rare insight into the viral dynamic of a individual recover from COVID over a month time frame Subject remain positive for viral RNA for at less âdays one of the long period of SARSCoV shed report at that time Little be know about this potential subpopulation of individual with persistent longterm viral recalcitrance Intermittent news report suggest that some convalesce COVID patient who have test negative for SARSCoV RNA by RTqPCR may retest positive late in recovery prompt speculation that some individual be vulnerable to reinfection other hypothesize that positive retest be the result of noninfectious residual viral fragment Unfortunately many of this report be anecdotal and not scientifically control Scientific study on the allege SARSCoV reinfection phenomenon be scarce There be isolate case report describe a situation in which a single COVID patient be discharge in part because of two consecutive negative SARSCoV RTqPCR clinical result but retest positive for SARSCoV RNA during convalescence â include a yearold woman who test positive for âdays from the onset of symptom âdays from her first positive test Other account detail similar result for small cohort of or much individual In a clinical study involve patient who recover from COVID retest positive for viral RNA in stool sample during convalescence A cohort of COVID patient be retest by RTqPCR little than âdays after selfreported symptom resolution Eleven subject be still diagnose as positive by RTqPCR at a median of âdays range to âdays a et al follow COVID patient for âweeks follow discharge and find that test positive for SARSCoV RNA suggest that this subset may be carrier of the virus In a similar study Huang et al find that out of recover COVID patient discharge and subsequently quarantine retest positive for SARSCoV with readmission and with readmission suggest that in some case the virus be replication competent The abovementioned case be distinct from socalled âlonghaul COVIDâ in which patient who recover from the acute phase of COVID continue to experience symptom for long period âdays All Oak Crest employee with the exception of subject remain negative for SARSCoV RNA over the course of the month study In our hand the RTqPCR appear to provide reliable result with no know false positive or negative With the exception of subject and inconclusive measurement ie only one of the two oligonucleotide probe target the viral nucleocapsid protein gene transcript fragment meet the assay threshold for positivity make up a small fraction of the test result We contend that in the context of a person develop or recover from COVID infection inconclusive SARSCoV RNA measurement can define the transition phase between positive and negative as support by FigÂ keep in mind datum publish regard the potential reinfectivity of SARSCoV subject and be continuously retest even follow occasion where subject receive consecutive negative result scatter inconclusive result accompany day of high CT value for subject and provide insight into the potential for reinfection and speak to the sensitivity of our assay This study be especially useful in distinguish between case that appear to be true reinfection and that that can be classify by the transition from a positive to a negative result Unexpectedly of employee test positive for antiSARSCoV antibody mostly IgM at baseline between March and April TableÂ suggest possible exposure to the virus prior to the start of the clinical study Many of this participant report suffer from symptom consistent with COVIDâthought to be a virulent flu strain at the timeâin the first half of February However none of this serum sample have detectable concentration of IgG which have the long halflife of the three measure virusspecific antibody FigÂ The finding remain unexplained and can be due to crossreactivity in the IgM assay Subject a selfquarantined employee who have just recover from suspect COVID base on symptomology at the start of the study repeatedly test negative for SARSCoV RNA but test positive for IgM antibody that rapidly decline t day FigÂ A No IgG or IgA antibody be detect in serum sample from this participant There be some caveat to interpret our antibody datum We measure only IgM IgG and IgA against RBD and not the whole spike or E protein as discuss in much detail elsewhere The IgM assay be subject to great uncertainty than the IgA and IgG assay at low concentration ca âÎ¼g mlâ or low and result need to be interpret with caution However all serum sample be analyze at three level of dilution and and only detectable concentration in at less of the dilute sample be report The clinical study describe here have meet its goal to date by provide a safe work environment for employee of a small academic institute at a time when the unite state be experience alarm expansion of the pandemic The test model constitute a validate practical framework that can be adopt by other small organization for this and future respiratory virus pandemic The ability to perform routine frequent COVID test not only have allow us to responsibly maintain a productive work environment during the pandemic but also have provide continuous reassure datum for the participate household many include vulnerable individual This have the important mental health benefit of reduce anxiety and provide a sense of normalcy in the workplace ie safe zone during a acutely stressful period The clinical studyâs success in prevent workplace SARSCoV transmission can be assess through a predictive analysis model local study impact predict that without our intervention up to employee or household contact can have become infect with SARSCoV by July Our find that only two subject contract COVID one prior to the start of the study suggest that workplace disease surveillance base on frequent longitudinal test combine with recommend public health practice social distance frequent hand sanitize and mask wear on select day when feasible can be effective at create a safe zone or bubble prevent COVID from enter into the workplace Our simulation predict a important local public health benefit from our scalable surveillance plan Similar approach be adopt subsequently in the summer of by professional sport league eg the National Hockey League the entertainment industry and other to support responsible resumption of their activity The study also generate important new scientific datum on the SARSCoV host

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00186-20","Lassa virus LASV pose a significant public health problem within the region of Lassa fever endemicity in Western Africa LASV infect several hundred thousand individual yearly and a considerable numb of Lassa fever case be associate with high morbidity and lethality No approve LASV vaccine be available and current therapy be limit to a offlabel usage of ribavirin that be only partially effective and associate with significant side effect The impact of Lassa fever on human health together with the limit exist countermeasure highlight the importance of develop effective vaccine against LASV Here we present the development and characterization of a recombinant LASV rLASV vaccine candidate rLASVIGRSS which be base on the presence of the noncoding intergenic region IGR of the small S genome segment SIGR in both large L and S LASV segment In culture cell rLASVIGRSS be modestly little fit than wildtype rLASV rLASVWT rLASVIGRSS be highly attenuate in guinea pig and a single subcutaneous low dose of the virus completely protect against otherwise lethal infection with LASVWT Moreover rLASVIGRSS be genetically stable during serial passage in culture cell this finding indicate that rLASVIGRSS can be develop into a LASV liveattenuated vaccine LAV that have the same antigenic composition as LASVWT and a welldefined mechanism of attenuation that overcome concern about increase virulence that can be cause by genetic change in the LAV during multiple round of multiplication INTRODUCTION Lassa fever LF be first describe in Lassa Nigeria in The causative agent of LF Lassa virus LASV be subsequently discover and isolate from LF patient and its natural host reservoir the Natal mastomys Mastomys natalensis LF pose a significant public health burden in the area where it be endemic mainly subSaharan Western Africa eg Guinea Liberia Nigeria and Sierra Leone A single longitudinal study conduct much than âyears ago in Sierra Leone estimate that hundred of thousand of LASV infection occur annually Among the people infect be asymptomatic whereas the other develop disease that usually require hospital admission Nevertheless LASV infection be largely ignore as a public health threat for extend period of time and the true incidence of LASV infection and the public health burden of LF in Western Africa remain unknown but be likely significant Case fatality rate CFRs of to have be report among hospitalize LF patient Recently the occurrence of a high numb of LF case associate with high up to case fatality rate in Nigeria trigger reevaluation of LF risk for global health security Moreover LASV expansion outside its traditional area of endemicity and increase travel have result in exportation of LF case from Western African country where the disease be endemic to country where it be nonendemic To date no US Food and Drug Administration FDAlicensed countermeasure be available to prevent or treat LASV and current antiLASV therapy be limit to the use of ribavirin which be only partially effective and can cause significant side effect Due to the impact of LF on human health and limit exist countermeasure to combat LF the World Health Organization WHO include LF on the revise list of priority disease for development of effective vaccine Like other mammarenaviruses Bunyavirales Arenaviridae LASV be a envelop virus with a bisegmented singlestranded RNA genome Each viral genome segment use a ambisense code strategy to direct the synthesis of two viral protein from open read frame separate by noncoding intergenic region IGRs The large L segment encode the large L protein that function as a viral RNA vRNAdirected RNA polymerase and RING finger protein Z which function as a matrixlike protein for virion assembly and bud â The small S segment encode the nucleoprotein NP and the glycoprotein GP precursor GPC â NP and L together with the vRNA form the viral L and S ribonucleoprotein complex vRNPs responsible for direct replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome NP be also involve in counteract innate immune response during viral infection â GPC be cotranslationally process by cellular signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide SSP and a GPC precursor that be posttranslationally cleave by the cellular proprotein convertase and subtilisin kexin isozymesite protease SKISP to generate GP and GP subunit The GP and GP subunit together with the SSP form mature GP peplomers on the surface of the virion envelope that mediate virion cell entry via receptormediated endocytosis â For a give mammarenavirus SIGRs and LIGRs differ in both sequence and predict secondary structure The IGRs play critical role in mammarenavirus transcriptional control and production of infectious particle The LIGR and SIGR of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV have distinct functional role in posttranscriptional control of viral gene expression The importance of the IGRs in viral multiplication have also be document for other arenaviruses For instance replication of a recombinant Lujo virus with a nucleotide deletion in the LIGR be impair in culture cell compare to its parental virus A Machupo virus with a nucleotide deletion within the LIGR be only moderately little fit in cell culture than the wildtype WT virus but highly attenuate in vivo Importantly a recombinant LCMV contain the SIGR in both the S and L genome segment rLCMVIGRSS be only modestly little fit in culture cell than rLCMVWT However rLCMVIGRSS be highly attenuate in a laboratory mouse model of LCMV infection but mouse immunize with rLCMVIGRSS be fully protect against a otherwise lethal infection with rLCMVWT On the basis of this promise result we examine whether reorganization of IGRs can represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation that can be apply to LASV In line with prospective epidemiological study in Western Africa liveattenuated vaccine LAVs represent the much feasible approach to control LF as LAVs induce longterm robust cellmediated response follow single immunization Here we report the generation of a recombinant LASV that contain the LASV SIGR in both the S and L genome segment rLASVIGRSS In vitro the viral fitness of rLASVIGRSS be moderately decrease compare to rLASVWT In vivo rLASVIGRSS be fully attenuate in both strain and Hartley guinea pig but provide full protection upon a single subcutaneous sc lowdose administration against a otherwise lethal exposure to LASVWT Our datum support far

serial passage in Vero cell Several mutation occur in the remainder of the L segment eg TC TC and TA and in the S segment eg CT which undulate in frequency during passage suggest that this mutation may not confer significant selective advantage A single nucleotide polymorphism SNP AT accumulate in the S segment during P to P At P SNPs TA YF in the GPC gene of the S segment and TA KN in the L gene be present at low frequency To test the impact of this SNPs on viral fitness the growth kinetic of rLASVIGRSS in Vero cell at a MOI of be compare at P P P and P rLASVIGRSS from this passage have similar growth kinetic in Vero cell and the viral peak titer be not statistically significantly different P suggest that the mutation describe above do not impact viral fitness in cell culture FigÂ C this result demonstrate that rLASVIGRSS be genetically stable up to passage in Vero cell DISCUSSION Fifty year after its first description LF still pose a major public health burden in the region where it be endemic in Western Africa The recent LF outbreak in Nigeria together with the lack of license medical countermeasure to combat LASV infection underscore the urgent need for LASV vaccine development Epidemiological study and nonhuman primate study provide evidence support the concept that LASVspecific cellmediated immune response be associate with effective control of virus replication and subsequent recovery Although passive transfer of a cocktail of engineer human neutralization antibody nab provide protective efficacy in LASV animal model â LASV nab appear at low titer in convalesce patient several month after initial infection this discrepant result indicate that nab probably do not contribute to viral control and recovery from acute infection follow a single immunization LAVs often induce longterm robust cellmediated and humoral immune response and represent the much feasible and attractive approach to combat LF within area of endemicity Several LF vaccine platform base on recombinant viral vector include vaccinia virus vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus VSIV Mopeia virus MOPV yellow fever virus measle virus MeV and reassortant ML carry the L segment from the nonpathogenic MOPV and the LASV S segment â have give promise result in LASV animal model include nonhuman primate Recombinant VSIV express LASV GPC rVSVLASVGPC recombinant MeV rMeVexpressing LASV GP and NP chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOxl express LASVGPC and mRNAbased or and DNAbased vaccine candidate represent five different LASV vaccine platform currently fund by the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovation CEPI to accelerate LASV vaccine development Nevertheless effective immunization with rVSVLASVGPC require a high dose that may cause significant VSIVassociated side effect and rMVLASV do not provide sterilize immunity against LASV infection which leave room for explore other vaccine platform The mammarenavirus IGRs play critical role in viral gene expression and infectious particle production We previously demonstrate the feasibility of replacement of the LIGR in the L segment with the SIGR in LCMV generate a recombinant rLCMVIGRSS Although this rLCMVIGRSS grow to a relatively high titer in culture cell in vitro the virus be highly attenuate in vivo and provide complete protection to immunize laboratory mouse against typically lethal LCMVWT exposure In the present study we use the same attenuation strategy to generate rLASVIGRSS in which the LIGR in the L segment be replace with the SIGR Although rLASVIGRSS exhibit a moderate decrease in viral fitness in culture cell compare to rLASVWT its viral titer still reach âÃâ PFUml in Vero cell Such a high viral titer response be important to develop a costeffective LAV vaccine Moreover rLASVIGRSS be highly attenuate in both strain and Hartley guinea pig Importantly immunization with only PFU of rLASVIGRSS be able to protect this guinea pig against a otherwise lethal exposure to LASV Consistent with result from other LASV vaccine platform study protection against a otherwise lethal dose of LASV in guinea pig immunize with rLASVIGRSS occur in the absence of detectable titer of LASVspecific neutralize antibody Genetic stability be a critical feature of a LAV candidate A common concern about viral LAV be their potential for reversion to a much virulent phenotype which be particularly important for RNA virus because their errorprone replication machinery enable rapid evolution On the basis of our finding with LCMV we expect that the underlie mechanism of attenuation of rLASVIGRSS involve alter control of virus gene expression cause by a welldefined genetic determinant namely the replacement of the LIGR by the SIGR This attenuate virus exhibit high genetic stability during serial passage in Vero cell indicate that the emergence of rLASVIGRSS variant with increase virulence be unlikely Our previous finding obtain with LCMV together with that we report here for LASV indicate that replacement of the LIGR by the SlGR can represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation This approach have the advantage that the correspond recombinant virus retain the same antigenic composition and therefore immunogenicity potential as the parental pathogenic strain The development of LASV reverse genetic have provide us a novel powerful tool to manipulate the LASV genome combine with the safety feature provide by the manipulation of IGRs with other attenuation strategy such as codondeoptimization CD the generate LASV

Lassa fever case No US Food and Drug Administrationlicensed countermeasure be available to prevent or treat LASV infection We describe the generation of a novel LASV liveattenuated vaccine candidate rLASVIGRSS which be base on the replacement of the large genomic segment noncoding intergenic region IGR with that of the small genome segment rLASVIGRSS be little fit in cell culture than wildtype virus and do not cause clinical sign in inoculate guinea pig Importantly rLASVIGRSS protect immunize guinea pig against a otherwise lethal exposure to LASV INTRODUCTION Lassa fever LF be first describe in Lassa Nigeria in The causative agent of LF Lassa virus LASV be subsequently discover and isolate from LF patient and its natural host reservoir the Natal mastomys Mastomys natalensis LF pose a significant public health burden in the area where it be endemic mainly subSaharan Western Africa eg Guinea Liberia Nigeria and Sierra Leone A single longitudinal study conduct much than âyears ago in Sierra Leone estimate that hundred of thousand of LASV infection occur annually Among the people infect be asymptomatic whereas the other develop disease that usually require hospital admission Nevertheless LASV infection be largely ignore as a public health threat for extend period of time and the true incidence of LASV infection and the public health burden of LF in Western Africa remain unknown but be likely significant Case fatality rate CFRs of to have be report among hospitalize LF patient Recently the occurrence of a high numb of LF case associate with high up to case fatality rate in Nigeria trigger reevaluation of LF risk for global health security Moreover LASV expansion outside its traditional area of endemicity and increase travel have result in exportation of LF case from Western African country where the disease be endemic to country where it be nonendemic To date no US Food and Drug Administration FDAlicensed countermeasure be available to prevent or treat LASV and current antiLASV therapy be limit to the use of ribavirin which be only partially effective and can cause significant side effect Due to the impact of LF on human health and limit exist countermeasure to combat LF the World Health Organization WHO include LF on the revise list of priority disease for development of effective vaccine Like other mammarenaviruses Bunyavirales Arenaviridae LASV be a envelop virus with a bisegmented singlestranded RNA genome Each viral genome segment use a ambisense code strategy to direct the synthesis of two viral protein from open read frame separate by noncoding intergenic region IGRs The large L segment encode the large L protein that function as a viral RNA vRNAdirected RNA polymerase and RING finger protein Z which function as a matrixlike protein for virion assembly and bud â The small S segment encode the nucleoprotein NP and the glycoprotein GP precursor GPC â NP and L together with the vRNA form the viral L and S ribonucleoprotein complex vRNPs responsible for direct replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome NP be also involve in counteract innate immune response during viral infection â GPC be cotranslationally process by cellular signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide SSP and a GPC precursor that be posttranslationally cleave by the cellular proprotein convertase and subtilisin kexin isozymesite protease SKISP to generate GP and GP subunit The GP and GP subunit together with the SSP form mature GP peplomers on the surface of the virion envelope that mediate virion cell entry via receptormediated endocytosis â For a give mammarenavirus SIGRs and LIGRs differ in both sequence and predict secondary structure The IGRs play critical role in mammarenavirus transcriptional control and production of infectious particle The LIGR and SIGR of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV have distinct functional role in posttranscriptional control of viral gene expression The importance of the IGRs in viral multiplication have also be document for other arenaviruses For instance replication of a recombinant Lujo virus with a nucleotide deletion in the LIGR be impair in culture cell compare to its parental virus A Machupo virus with a nucleotide deletion within the LIGR be only moderately little fit in cell culture than the wildtype WT virus but highly attenuate in vivo Importantly a recombinant LCMV contain the SIGR in both the S and L genome segment rLCMVIGRSS be only modestly little fit in culture cell than rLCMVWT However rLCMVIGRSS be highly attenuate in a laboratory mouse model of LCMV infection but mouse immunize with rLCMVIGRSS be fully protect against a otherwise lethal infection with rLCMVWT On the basis of this promise result we examine whether reorganization of IGRs can represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation that can be apply to LASV In line with prospective epidemiological study in Western Africa liveattenuated vaccine LAVs represent the much feasible approach to control LF as LAVs induce longterm robust cellmediated response follow single immunization Here we report the generation of a recombinant LASV that contain the LASV SIGR in both the S and L genome segment rLASVIGRSS In vitro the viral fitness of rLASVIGRSS be moderately decrease compare to rLASVWT In vivo rLASVIGRSS be fully attenuate in both strain and Hartley guinea pig but provide full protection upon a single subcutaneous sc lowdose administration against a otherwise lethal exposure to LASVWT Our

serial passage in Vero cell Several mutation occur in the remainder of the L segment eg TC TC and TA and in the S segment eg CT which undulate in frequency during passage suggest that this mutation may not confer significant selective advantage A single nucleotide polymorphism SNP AT accumulate in the S segment during P to P At P SNPs TA YF in the GPC gene of the S segment and TA KN in the L

this result demonstrate that rLASVIGRSS be genetically stable up to passage in Vero cell DISCUSSION Fifty year after its first description LF still pose a major public health burden in the region where it be endemic in Western Africa The recent LF outbreak in Nigeria together with the lack of license medical countermeasure to combat LASV infection underscore the urgent need for LASV vaccine development Epidemiological study and nonhuman primate study provide evidence support the concept that LASVspecific cellmediated immune response be associate with effective control of virus replication and subsequent recovery Although passive transfer of a cocktail of engineer human neutralization antibody nab provide protective efficacy in LASV animal model â LASV nab appear at low titer in convalesce patient several month after initial infection this discrepant result indicate that nab probably do not contribute to viral control and recovery from acute infection follow a single immunization LAVs often induce longterm robust cellmediated and humoral immune response and represent the much feasible and attractive approach to combat LF within area of endemicity Several LF vaccine platform base on recombinant viral vector include vaccinia virus vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus VSIV Mopeia virus MOPV yellow fever virus measle virus MeV and reassortant ML carry the L segment from the nonpathogenic MOPV and the LASV S segment â have give promise result in LASV animal model include nonhuman primate Recombinant VSIV express LASV GPC rVSVLASVGPC recombinant MeV rMeVexpressing LASV GP and NP chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOxl express LASVGPC and mRNAbased or and DNAbased vaccine candidate represent five different LASV vaccine platform currently fund by the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovation CEPI to accelerate LASV vaccine development Nevertheless effective immunization with rVSVLASVGPC require a high dose that may cause significant VSIVassociated side effect and rMVLASV do not provide sterilize immunity against LASV infection which leave room for explore other vaccine platform The mammarenavirus IGRs play critical role in viral gene expression and infectious particle production We previously demonstrate the feasibility of replacement of the LIGR in the L segment with the SIGR in LCMV generate a recombinant rLCMVIGRSS Although this rLCMVIGRSS grow to a relatively high titer in culture cell in vitro the virus be highly attenuate in vivo and provide complete protection to immunize laboratory mouse against typically lethal LCMVWT exposure In the present study we use the same attenuation strategy to generate rLASVIGRSS in which the LIGR in the L segment be replace with the SIGR Although rLASVIGRSS exhibit a moderate decrease in viral fitness in culture cell compare to rLASVWT its viral titer still reach âÃâ PFUml in Vero cell Such a high viral titer response be important to develop a costeffective LAV vaccine Moreover rLASVIGRSS be highly attenuate in both strain and Hartley guinea pig Importantly immunization with only PFU of rLASVIGRSS be able to protect this guinea pig against a otherwise lethal exposure to LASV Consistent with result from other LASV vaccine platform study protection against a otherwise lethal dose of LASV in guinea pig immunize with rLASVIGRSS occur in the absence of detectable titer of LASVspecific neutralize antibody Genetic stability be a critical feature of a LAV candidate A common concern about viral LAV be their potential for reversion to a much virulent phenotype which be particularly important for RNA virus because their errorprone replication machinery enable rapid evolution On the basis of our finding with LCMV we expect that the underlie mechanism of attenuation of rLASVIGRSS involve alter control of virus gene expression cause by a welldefined genetic determinant namely the replacement of the LIGR by the SIGR This attenuate virus exhibit high genetic stability during serial passage in Vero cell indicate that the emergence of rLASVIGRSS variant with increase virulence be unlikely Our previous finding obtain with LCMV together with that we report here for LASV indicate that replacement of the LIGR by the SlGR can represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation This approach have the advantage that the correspond recombinant virus retain the same antigenic composition and therefore immunogenicity potential as the parental pathogenic strain The development of LASV reverse genetic have provide us a novel powerful tool to manipulate the LASV genome combine with the safety feature provide by the manipulation of IGRs with other attenuation strategy such as codondeoptimization CD the generate LASV

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.02359-10","The vaccinia virus VACV Lister strain be one of the vaccine strain that enable smallpox eradication Although the strain be much often harmless there have be numerous incident of mild to lifethreatening accident with this strain and other In a attempt to far attenuate the Lister strain we investigate the role of genomic region know to be delete in the modify VACV Ankara MVA genome in virulence in immunodeficient mouse immunogenicity in immunocompetent mouse and vaccine efficacy in a cowpox virus challenge model Lister mutant be construct so as to delete each of the region or various combination of this region All of the mutant replicate efficiently in tissue culture except region I mutant which multiply much poorly in human cell than the parental strain mutant with single deletion be not attenuate or only moderately so in athymic nude mouse mutant with multiple deletion be much highly attenuate than that with single deletion delete region II III and V together result in total attenuation for nude mouse and partial attenuation for SCID mouse In immunocompetent mouse the Lister deletion mutant induce VACV specific humoral response equivalent to that of the parental strain but in some case low cellmediated immune response All of the highly attenuate mutant protect mouse from a severe cowpox virus challenge at low vaccine dose The datum suggest that several of the Lister mutant combine multiple deletion can be use in smallpox vaccination or as live virus vector at dose equivalent to that use for the traditional vaccine while display increase safety INTRODUCTION Vaccinia virus VACV have display extraordinary efficacy as a live attenuate vaccine since it have enable the eradication of smallpox one of the much deadly infectious disease for mankind Although smallpox vaccination be no long routinely employ some country continue to vaccinate select population because of the fear of biological warfare or bioterrorism During the course of their use the smallpox vaccine be responsible for numerous vaccineassociated accident like eczema vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia in individual with immune deficiency or skin disorder Encephalitis be also long recognize as a very serious vaccinerelated risk with a unknown predisposition and vaccineinduced myopericarditis have be document as a adverse event It be therefore not surprise that a good deal of research have be devote to design strategy that reduce the risk associate with smallpox vaccination far attenuation of the smallpox vaccine have also be seek because VACV be a attractive live virus vector for vaccination against infectious disease and display promise activity as a vector for prophylaxis and therapy of cancer modify vaccinia virus Ankara MVA be one of the first VACV strain show to be highly attenuate in smallanimal model and safe in human trial MVA be isolate during the s from the chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara strain CVA by extensive serial passage in chicken embryo fibroblast a process which entail major deletion as good as numerous small deletion and point mutation within of the open read frame ORFs One of the outstanding property of MVA be its failure to multiply in much mammalian cell particularly human cell study in HeLa cell have show that MVA infection be follow by a nearly complete virus life cycle up to the accumulation of immature or aberrant viral particle and the release of a few aberrant envelop viral particle This abortive virus life cycle be clearly sufficient to immunize mouse against a variety of orthopoxvirus challenge infection to vaccinate nonhuman primate against severe monkeypox virus infection and to induce a VACVlike immune response in human volunteer In much study which have evaluate MVA as a vaccine against challenge orthopoxvirus infection it have display efficacy only at much high dose than the traditional smallpox vaccine with one surprise exception in keep with the fact that MVA be unable to propagate at the site of inoculation and large virus dose be good tolerate Such high dose have even be show to have the add advantage of induce a much rapid immune response than traditional smallpox vaccine In view of the very promise behavior of MVA as a highly attenuate smallpox vaccine as good as a vaccine vector it be important to gain a full understand of the molecular basis of its attenuation and vaccine efficacy Clearly the failure of MVA to multiply in much mammalian cell be one essential feature that explain in vivo attenuation although the full spectrum of viral gene that account for this phenotype have only be partially characterize The MVA genome also lack a numb of gene encode immunomodulatory function find in other VACV genome indicate that it do not interfere with the antiviral immune response as efficiently as other VACV strain In fact numerous study have show that MVA activate the innate immune response much effectively than standard VACV Two strategy be consider to far investigate how the major deletion in the MVA strain affect its attenuation and vaccine efficacy The first one would involve introduce region delete from the MVA strain back into this virus whereas the 2 would involve delete the same region from another virus the parental strain of MVA CVA or a relate strain We choose the latter strategy because it may allow the isolation of moreattenuated VACV strain from a establish smallpox vaccine whose efficacy have be historically demonstrate Instead of use the CVA strain as the start point as recently report by MeisingerHenshel et al we choose to start from the VACV Lister VACVLis strain because this WHO reference strain be one of the much widely use strain during the smallpox eradication campaign Recent datum have establish that the Lister strain induce human antibody response comparable to that of the Dryvax strain another commonly use smallpox vaccine Genomic deletion of this strain can increase its safety and make it much suitable for far use It be also postulate that use a establish smallpox vaccine with a small numb of deletion than the numb that occur in the MVA strain may lead to a safe vaccine that be effective at low dose than that use with the MVA strainMATERIALS AND method Virus and cell culture A clonal isolate of the Lister strain of the smallpox

GraphPad La Jolla CA software P value â¤ be consider significantRESULTS Isolation of VACV deletion mutant and analysis of their multiplication in cell culture Six major region be delete in the MVA strain relative to other closely relate VACV strain this region be localize at the leave and right end of the viral genome and have be previously designate with roman numeral from I to VI We delete each of this region Fig top except region VI from the genome of VACV a clonal isolate of the Lister strain use the transient dominant selection method describe by Falkner and Moss Region I bp which encode several putative protein of unknown function as good as a serine protease inhibitor Spi important for virus host range in at less one human cell line be delete individually region II and V which be adjacent at the leave end of the genome be delete together with the intervene region overall bp This affect ORFs include one encode a kelch protein that antagonize viral immunopathology CL in the VACV Copenhagen strain one encode a complement control protein CL in the VACV Copenhagen strain and one encode a host range protein and inhibitor of type I interferon KL as good as two gene that lie at the boundary of region II and V the virulence factor NL gene and the Î± amanitinsensitive gene NL the former frameshifted at its â² end and the latter internally delete in MVA Region III bp with respect to VACV correspond to a bp deletion with respect to VACV Copenhagen overlap four ORFs include ORFs encode a tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor CrmC a suppressor of TollIL signal and a kelch protein which affect the virusinduced cytopathic effect be delete on its own Region IV be delete in two step The first step be to delete bp with respect to VACV bp with respect to VACV Copenhagen at both end of the Lister genome the delete region overlap five gene correspond to truncate segment of fulllength gene find in other orthopoxviruses Viral deletion mutant be screen by PCR to identify that with mirror deletion at both end of the genome The 2 step involve delete bp overlap a TNF receptor CrmE gene and a antiapoptotic virulence factor gene The two deletion be then combine in one virus to streamline subsequent analysis Once virus mutant with single deletion or in some case combine deletion be isolate they be use as parental virus to isolate mutant with increase number of deletion in such a way that various combination of the five target deletion be construct The predict structure of the mutant genome be confirm by PCR and illustrate for one mutant which have all five deletion VACV ÎIV Fig bottom primer be choose for each region delete so as to amplify a or kbp fragment in the mutant virus VACV ÎIV whereas fragment range in size from kbp to kbp be amplify in the VACV strain as predict from the size of the intact region in the parental virus include the surround or kbp region Table column Finally a deletion be also introduce into the thymidine kinase TK gene of the Lister strain to create a virus strain with previously document attenuation The ability of the mutant to multiply in several cell line be examine All mutant be routinely propagate on the chicken embryonic stem cell line EB and all of them be find to form plaque and multiply to high yield in this cell datum not show Titration of virus be perform on hamster BHK cell and all of the deletion mutant produce clearly visible plaque after a day incubation period Since several of the region delete include previously characterize host range gene essential for multiplication in human cell line the deletion mutant be test for their ability to multiply in HeLa cell culture Initial experiment show that all of the mutant isolate after one round of deletion multiply good in this human cell except mutant ÎI which produce yield about fold low than the parental Lister strain The influence of the ÎI deletion within the background of other deletion be then investigate Virus titer in the infectedcell culture of BHK cell be assay after several cycle of freeze and thaw sample either h after infection to estimate the amount of input virus or h after infection multiplicity of infection MOI to determine virus yield All of the mutant contain the ÎI deletion multiply to level to fold low than the parental Lister strain Fig indicate that this deletion indeed affect virus multiplication in human HeLa cell However there be no additional effect of the other deletion on virus multiplication indicate that only ÎI contribute to the reduce virus yield Similar experiment carry out in the MRC cell line also indicate that the ÎI deletion entail reduce virus yield in this human diploid cell line datum not show Assessment of attenuation of the deletion mutant in nude mouse and SCID mouse First the pathogenicity of the deletion mutant be assess in athymic nude mouse defective for the production of antigenspecific T lymphocyte and T celldependent antibody because this animal be highly susceptible to VACV infection unlike immunocompetent mouse group of six mouse be inoculate by scarification at the base of the tail with virus suspension titrate at PFUml thus deliver approximately PFU a dose equivalent to that use for smallpox puncture vaccination in human which be also recognize to be a highly effective mean of vaccination in mouse The morbidity and mortality of the infect animal as good as that of a control mockinfected group be follow over a week period in separate experiment perform at less twice for each mutant Mockinfected animal gain weight regularly over the period of observation whereas animal infect with the VACV isolate or the original VACV Lister strain VACVLis gain weight much slowly over the first week then dramatically lose weight until their death between day and postinfection Fig Loss of weight in this animal correlate with virus dissemination to other site on the tail and the body All of the mouse infect with the single deletion mutant ÎIV or the TK genedeleted mutant die and some die in the group infect with the singledeletion mutant ÎI and ÎIII although overall weight loss be delay Fig A and B Therefore each of this deletion only mildly reduce the pathogenicity of the VACV clone in nude mouse The doubledeletion mutant ÎIIV also induce weight loss and mortality similar to that induce by the singledeletion mutant ÎI and ÎIV mouse infect with mutant with two or much region delete survive infection except for ÎIIV but in much instance fail to gain weight as fast as mockinfected animal P mouse infect with mutant ÎIIII ÎIIV ÎIIIV and ÎIIIIVV gain weight as fast as control animal at first but fail to reach the same body weight as uninfected animal mouse infect with mutant ÎIIIIV ÎIIIIIV and ÎIIIVV gain weight much slowly than control animal then start to lose weight compare with the initial body weight Therefore this deletion mutation induce significant morbidity in nude mouse albeit not to the extent of the parental VACV strain In contrast mouse infect with four mutant gain weight over the period of observation in a similar manner to that of the mockinfected control mouse ÎIIIIIV ÎIIIIIIV ÎIIIIIIVV and ÎIV P Fig C this datum show that the combine deletion of the three genomic region II III and V be sufficient to completely eliminate morbidity as measure by loss of body weight in nude mouse The numb of secondary lesion on the tail and the rest of the body of this mouse vary between and and their size be reduce to mm Table The numb of secondary lesion have be find to correlate closely with body weight loss in infect nude mouse see Fig at httpigbmcfrSchultzjv Overall three independent experiment be perform with the four much highly attenuate mutant present in Fig C and in two of them nude mouse gain weight as if they be uninfected P whereas in a 3 experiment animal infect with mutant ÎIIIIIIVV and ÎIIIIIIV also behave like uninfected animal P while animal infect with mutant ÎIV and ÎIIIIIV survive infection but fail to gain as much weight as uninfected animal P datum not show Severely immunodeficient SCID mouse be then use to examine the pathogenicity of the deletion mutant that display the high level of attenuation in the nude mouse model As expect tail scarification with PFU of VACVLis or the clonal isolate VACV result in considerable weight loss begin about day postinfection and continue until the animal die Fig On the other hand all mouse infect with the deletion mutant gain much weight than animal infect with the parental virus but then slowly lose weight over the period of observation probably due to slow virus multiplication in this animal In fact the lesion at the site of vaccination gradually increase in size and there be several secondary lesion that appear over time this animal be nevertheless alive after day of infection when the experiment be end Immune response induce by the deletion mutant We then assess the immune response induce by the much highly attenuate virus in immunocompetent BALBc mouse after vaccination by tail scarification with a virus dose equivalent to that use in immunodeficient mouse PFU per animal A local lesion appear at the site of scarification for much mouse a few day after vaccination then regress and the mouse do not display any sign of morbidity whatever virus be employ Four week late the mouse be bleed and neutralize antibody Nab titer in the serum sample be determine and express as the reciprocal of the serum dilution lead to a reduction in plaque count Fig Whereas uninfected animal display mean Nab titer little than mouse infect with the parental VACVLis strain or the clonal isolate induce similar level of Nab P which be within the range of the titer find in human subject vaccinate against smallpox The Nab titer with all of the deletion mutant be similar to that with the parental Lister strain and the clonal VACV isolate P The cellmediated immune response be also assay week after tail scarification of BALBc mouse with PFUanimal After week vaccinate mouse display a steadystate level in their cellmediated immune response suggest that this be a appropriate time to assay this response and challenge them see below spleen be recover and spleen cell suspension be stimulate with VACVinfected dendritic cell The level of VACVspecific CD and CD lymphocyte be measure by assay for the percentage of IFNÎ³secreting cell in the spleen cell population use flow cytometry Fig The clonal isolate VACV and the traditional Lister vaccine induce comparable VACVspecific CD lymphocyte response P which be about to fold high than the background level in mockinfected animal P The highly attenuate deletion mutant ÎIIIIIV and ÎIIIIIIV induce a VACVspecific CD response slightly but significantly low than that induce by the parental VACV strain P whereas the mutant ÎIIIIIIVV and ÎIV induce response comparable to that induce by the parental strain In the case of the specific CD cell response both the uncloned VACVLis strain and the clonal isolate induce similar response which be about fold high than the basal level measure for splenocytes from mockinfected animal P The specific CD response with all of the deletion mutant except ÎIIIIIV be significantly low than that induce by the parental virus P but between and fold high than that of uninfected animal Protection of mouse from CPXV challenge by vaccination with the deletion mutant Previous study have demonstrate that cowpox virus CPXV infection of mouse by the intranasal route provide a model infection for smallpox and that traditional smallpox vaccine can protect against disease and death in this model system In order to assess the efficacy of the much highly attenuate deletion mutant BALBc mouse be vaccinate by scarification at the base of the tail with Ã to Ã PFU of each deletion mutant VACV or VACVLis Each dose be administer to six mouse per group and month late the animal be challenge with LD of CPXV All animal in the unvaccinated group succumb after challenge between the th and th day after infection and none of the unvaccinated unchallenged animal die datum not show much of the animal vaccinate with the high virus dose PFUscarification lose between and of their body weight by about the 9 day postinfection because of the severity of the challenge and then progressively recover There be no statistically significant difference in the rate of weight loss or weight recovery between animal vaccinate with the different virus mutant or the VACV parental virus P see Fig at httpigbmcfrSchultzjv The survival of mouse in three independent experiment where each virus be test at less twice be show in Table In two experiment all animal vaccinate with PFU of the VACV Lister clone survive and out of mouse survive in the 3 experiment consistent with the level of protection afford by the uncloned VACVLis strain Similarly the majority of the animal vaccinate with PFU of the deletion mutant survive Table and all of them survive after vaccination with PFU datum not show except one animal in group ÎIIIIIIVV Intermediate and poor level of survival be observe for animal vaccinate with or PFU respectively of VACV VACVLis or the deletion mutant The viral dose able to protect of the animal PD be calculate use the method of Reed and Muench and find to be Â± log PFU in the case of the Lister clone and Â± log PFU with the traditional vaccine The PDs for the mutant be within the same range as that for the parental clone or VACVLis demonstrate that the deletion of up to five select region in the VACV Lister virus genome do not alter the ability to efficiently protect mouse against a challenge infection DISCUSSION We have investigate the role of region in the VACV Lister genome know to be delete in the MVA genome deletion I to V on replication in human cell virulence in the nude and SCID mouse model induction of specific immune response in immunocompetent mouse and vaccine efficacy in a CPXV challenge model The influence of delete region VI be not investigate because it be think unlikely to affect virulence since it encompass one gene fragment in all VACV strain a orthologue of the CPXV virus gene encode the Atype inclusion protein as good as a truncate copy of another gene pc show to be important for association of viral particle with Atype inclusion which be absent from VACVinfected cell Infection of human cell indicate that deletion of region I entail a significant reduction in virus multiplication This result be not too surprise as region I contain the SpiI gene which have previously be show to be require for multiplication of VACV WR in the human lung cell line A Deletion of region I can therefore contribute to far attenuation of the VACV Lister strain if the strain be use to vaccinate human Deletion mutant of the CVA strain similar to the one we have construct be extensively study for their host range in vitro and find to be replication defective in two rabbit cell line consistent with deletion of the KL gene However the same CVA mutant be able to multiply efficiently in other mammalian cell line include human cell line The distinct genetic background of the CVA strain can account for failure of the CVA deletion to affect viral multiplication in human cell as we have notice for Lister mutant with region I delete Infection of athymic nude mouse with the mutant demonstrate that the deletion of single genomic region be insufficient to induce a high level of attenuation compare with the parental viral clone VACV or the traditional smallpox vaccine Particularly interest in this respect be region IV which contain in addition to a numb of truncate gene a biologically active TNF receptor CrmE gene previously show to be require for VACV virulence in a murine intranasal model and a gene encode a Golgi resident antiapoptotic protein whose deletion do not affect weight loss in the murine intranasal model but rather increase the severity of other sign of illness Thus the opposite effect of delete this two gene in the ÎIV mutant may result in no phenotype at all or alternatively this two gene may play no significant role in the particular mouse scarification model we have employ The combine deletion of at less two region for instance region I and III result in survival of all nude mouse although some morbidity occur Several VACV mutant harbor multiple deletion be clearly much attenuate than VACV or the traditional smallpox vaccine but still display some pathogenicity Only four deletion mutant prove to be totally attenuate in the T celldeficient mouse model as ascertain from survival and body weight loss ÎIIIIIV ÎIIIIIIV ÎIIIIIIVV and ÎIV all of them have at less region II III and V delete In contrast deletion of the TK gene know to be attenuate upon VACV infection in other animal model do not significantly alter virus pathogenicity for nude mouse In SCID mouse which be much severely immunocompromise than nude mouse the highly attenuate deletion mutant characterize in the nude mouse model do not induce any mortality over the period of observation but mouse fail to gain weight as good as uninfected animal and eventually start to lose weight this result reflect the fact that the deletion mutant be able to multiply in SCID mouse as multiple secondary lesion appear over time The datum from study in human cell nude mouse and SCID mouse suggest that the deletion of region I II III and V may be sufficient to obtain satisfactory attenuation of the Lister strain in human Two deletion mutant test would good fit this requirement namely mutant ÎIIIIIIV and ÎIIIIIIIVV Despite clearcut attenuation in immunocompromise mouse the four much attenuate VACV deletion mutant induce humoral response equivalent to that of the standard Lister vaccine On the other hand the cellmediated immune response induce by the mutant be in several instance significantly low than that of the Lister parent Nevertheless all of the highly attenuate mutant display remarkable vaccine efficacy as illustrate by protection of immunocompetent mouse from a severe CPXV challenge infection Calculation of the protective dose and analysis of weight loss and recovery after challenge with CPXV do not allow us to discern any difference in vaccine efficacy between the much attenuate mutant study It be possible however that the use of low challenge dose or other animal model would enable such a discrimination On the other hand our result suggest that the major MVA deletion contribute to attenuation of this virus but they cannot explain why high MVA dose be need to achieve maximum vaccine potency It be probably the failure of MVA to multiply in much mammalian host include mouse which entail the requirement for high MVA vaccine dose In contrast our experimental datum suggest that the VACV Lister deletion mutant that replicate in human cell although much poorly in the case of ÎI may be able to effectively vaccinate human subject at a dose equivalent to that use for the traditional smallpox vaccine while display increase safety for immunocompromise and other contraindicate subject Numerous study of VACV mutant with single nonessential gene delete have show that the vast majority of this gene contribute to virulence in one animal model or another However few study have examine the consequence of such attenuation for vaccine efficacy much of the attenuate deletion in the NYCBH and Wyeth strain examine by Lee et al actually result in reduce immunogenicity at low vaccine dose with the exception of a mutant with the TK gene delete On the other hand deletion of the EL gene encode a doublestranded RNA dsRNA bind protein result in strike attenuation in a mouse model of severe combine immunodeficiency and considerable vaccine potency by scarification of immunocompetent mouse despite the fact that the deletion mutant appear inefficient at induce VACVneutralizing antibody Deletion of several gene encode immunomodulatory function from the Wyeth strain result in only moderate attenuation in a intracranial weanling mouse model and much of the mutant maintain immunogenicity although no vaccine protection study be perform Deletion of the gene encode serpin BR equivalent to ORF in the Lister strain and serpin BR in VACV Cop from the VACV WR strain lead to significant attenuation characterize by a delay in death after infection of nude mouse and lack of pathogenicity in immunocompetent mouse after intraperitoneal inoculation The deletion virus maintain their ability to induce potent humoral and cellmediated immune response but orthopoxvirus challenge infection be not perform Deletion of region II in the Tian Tan strain of VACV result in attenuation in immunocompetent mouse and immunity when use as a vaccine vector but no challenge study be perform Recently by recombineering the CVA genome in bacterial artificial chromosome MeisingerHenschel et al report the construction of deletion mutant mirror the major MVA deletion They notice only moderate attenuation of the deletion mutant in immunocompetent mouse infect intranasally and identify region V as the major region involve Their study clearly indicate that the major deletion in the MVA strain be not sufficient to account for the characteristic MVA phenotype and that other mutation still to be identify be need The CVA deletion mutant be however not examine for their ability to induce a immune response or protect mouse from a challenge orthopoxvirus infection In conclusion our result extend previous finding by demonstrate that considerable virus attenuation may be achieve for immunocompromise animal if multiple region of the Lister genome be delete Despite this attenuation the deletion mutant be able to induce VACVspecific immune response and display vaccine potency similar to that of the traditional smallpox vaccine Recent study have show that VACV multiplication may be a requirement in some instance for the induction of potent immune response The combination of multiple deletion in a single virus make it unlikely that the mutant revert to a virulent phenotype thus provide a potentially safe yet efficient smallpox vaccine as good as the basis for the development of a novel VACV vectorACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work be finance in part by a grant from INSERMTransfert JD be the recipient of a PhD scholarship from the DÃ©lÃ©gation GÃ©nÃ©rale pour lArmement

the basis of a protocolmandated interim analysis to review the efficacy and safety datum for up to day after treatment follow review of the interim datum by a independent datum monitor board the study be continue on the basis of adequate efficacy and safety resultsPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment To avoid excessive blood collection in infant or child with malaria a sparse pharmacokinetic sample approach be use We hypothesize that early treatment failure may be relate to insufficient exposure to the rapidly act artemether andor DHA as indicate by low maximum concentration in plasma Cmax value rather than to low exposure to slowacting lumefantrine Therefore exposure to artemether and DHA be assess in that patient recruit until the result of the interim analysis indicate adequate treatment response as measure by day cure rate After the interim analysis the focus be switch to lumefantrine exposure Hence in all patient enroll prior to the interim analysis two blood sample per patient be collect at and h after the first dose of DT or CT for the measurement of artemether and DHA in plasma ie anticipate time of Cmax Tmax In order to reconstitute a full lumefantrine pharmacokinetic profile for the population study one blood sample per patient be take at different time point in patient enroll at all study center after the interim analysis

Pharmacokinetic parameter of lumefantrine be derive from the population mean concentrationtime curve This curve be construct by average all concentration available for the specify sample interval relative to the time of the first dose ie to h h after dose to h h after dose to h h after dose to h day to h day and to h day and take the mean of the actual sample time in each interval Population mean curve be construct per formulation for all pediatric patient as good as for each of the three body weight group ie to kg to kg and to kg Cmax and the area under the concentrationtime curve from

be the day PCRcorrected parasitological cure rate occurrence of AEs and QTc change To far explore exposureoutcome relationship statistical model generalize linear model or correlation model from Statistical Analysis System software CORR Procedure be use whenever appropriate The pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic substudy be explorative in nature thus no formal sample size calculation be perform For the main study on the basis of a expect cure rate of at less for both treatment and assume a nonevaluability rate eg loss of followup a sample size of patient per treatment group be calculate As prospectively define in the study protocol pharmacokinetic parameter be not statistically compare between treatment group for the follow reason i the Cmax and AUCâlast of lumefantrine have be derive from a population mean concentrationtime curve and no estimate of variability for this parameter be available and ii for artemether and DHA Cmax high interpatient variability be expect as Cmax show a inherently large variation than integrate characteristic such as AUC and Cmax have be determine to be the large of just two postdose concentration value In addition comparison of formulation with identical active ingredient base on statistical significance P value may be misleadingRESULTS patient A total of patient be randomize into the main study to DT male and to CT male with comparable

sample each available to determine Cmax For CT patient participate in the sparse sample with sample each available for Cmax determination Thus this result be not present Pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic relationship i Efficacy In the population as a whole median PCTs be almost identical between DT h and CT h group In the pharmacokinetic substudy no clinically meaningful correlation be find between the artemether or DHA Cmax and PCT for any of the treatment Fig This be support by result of quintile analysis Artemether and DHA Cmax value be categorize into quintile to to to and â¥ ngml for artemether to to to and â¥ ngml for DHA and the predefine efficacy variable be compare across this concentration range When DT and CT datum be pool no descriptive relationship be observe between artemether or DHA Cmax after the first dose and PCT There be no major difference between the low and high artemether concentration quintile with regard to PCT Specifically the percentage of patient with PCTs of â¤ h to â¤ h and h be and respectively for the low artemether quintile and and respectively for the high quintile For DHA this percentage be and respectively for the low quintile and and respectively for the high quintile For both artemether and DHA there be no presence or persistence of asexual parasite at day in any of the concentration quintile and all patient be cure by day consider the entire study population day PCRcorrected cure rate be in the DT group and in the CT group Due to the very few case of treatment failure overall and only failure with plasma lumefantrine measure at h after dose no relationship between the lumefantrine Cmax and day cure rate can be investigate use quintile analysis Nevertheless in that patient with treatment failure and lumefantrine level available DT n CT n there be a tendency toward low lumefantrine concentration Fig However other patient with even low plasma concentration be treat successfully Fig ii Safety We fail to find a association between the lumefantrine Cmax and the occurrence of treatmentemergent AEs The mean number of treatmentemergent AEs be low quintile and high quintile with malariarelated symptom be the much commonly report AEs Overall the QTc interval Bazetts formula from baseline to day increase by little than ms specifically by a mean of ms SD ms in the DT group and a mean of ms SD ms in the CT group In the pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic substudy linear regression analysis DT and CT datum pool suggest a possible association between lumefantrine Cmax and QTc prolongation The association reach statistical significance with Bazetts formula but not with Fridericias formula P Bazetts formula P Fridericias formula In contrast descriptive quintile analysis show no apparent relationship between lumefantrine Cmax and the increase in QTc from baseline The lumefantrine concentration at h after dose be categorize into quintile to to to and â¥ Î¼gml The average QTc increase from baseline to day be then calculate within each quintile The pattern of QTc increase Bazetts formula appear to be inconsistent across the concentration quintile ie and ms Similar result be see use Fridericias formula datum not shownDISCUSSION A pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic substudy be perform within a multicenter investigatorblinded randomize noninferiority trial compare the efficacy and safety of a new pediatric formulation of AL dispersible tablet and the tablet administer crush in African infant and child with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria We acknowledge the limitation of a sparse sample approach for lumefantrine which allow only a approximation of pharmacokinetic parameter Moreover for artemether and DHA the report Cmax value be derive from value only and may not accurately reflect the true Cmax for this substance follow oral intake of AL DT and CT Finally Cmax comparison be a limit description of the pharmacokinetic feature of AL DT and CT Nevertheless the result of our analysis suggest that the dispersible tablet and the tablet administer crush have similar pharmacokinetic characteristic in the target population The population plasma concentrationtime profile of lumefantrine and the derive parameter Cmax Tmax and AUCâlast be without major difference between the two treatment Likewise mean Cmax value of artemether and DHA be similar for the two AL formulation test Small numerical difference be not consider clinically relevant The latter be support by the clinical efficacy and safety datum assess in the entire study population which show that the dispersible formulation be as efficacious as the tablet administer crush and have a similar safety profile This be one of the first report of artemether and DHA exposure datum in child with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria treat with AL Mean artemether and DHA Cmax value observe in this trial and ngml respectively for the dispersible tablet and ngml respectively for the tablet administer crush be in accordance with that report previously in adult malaria patient from Thailand treat with the dose regimen of AL tablet this be Â± ngml for artemether and Â± ngml for DHA after the first dose of AL A recently publish small study of child from Uganda assess the pharmacokinetics of artemether and DHA after the 3 dose of a AL tablet The different study design limit the comparability of that pharmacokinetic result with the result of our analysis Moreover the rate and extent of lumefantrine absorption assess in our study Cmax and Î¼gml for dispersible and crush tablet respectively AUCs and Î¼g Â · hml respectively be comparable to that determine in adult malaria patient from Thailand and pediatric and adult patient from Africa In one study conduct in Ugandan child kg body weight on average the geometric mean lumefantrine Cmax be Î¼gml and the AUC from time zero to h after the last dose amount to Î¼g Â · hml The low AUC compare to our analysis can be explain by different sample collection protocol The apparent lack of a correlation between artemether and DHA Cmax value after the first AL dose and the PCT suggest that with even low initial Cmax value the minimum effective concentration be exceed and maximal effect be achieve rapidly Analogous result have be report for artesunate another artemisinin derivative where no significant relationship can be show between parasite clearance and initial plasma concentration of DHA or artesunateDHA exposure use AUC in the first h A semimechanistic model of parasite dynamic describe the early effect of artemether and DHA concentration on the parasite density in malaria patient have recently be propose In this study we detect no relationship between lumefantrine exposure and the likelihood of parasitological cure in particular because of few treatment failure However the observe lowerthanaverage lumefantrine concentration in the few patient with treatment failure who have pharmacokinetic sample be in agreement with several report from study in Thailand and Papua New Guinea show that the lumefantrine plasma level be a key determinant of AL efficacy The observe absence of a relationship between lumefantrine Cmax and the incidence of AEs may be explain by the fact that much commonly report AEs be symptom of malaria The potential relationship between lumefantrine Cmax and QTc value be also evaluate in this study Quintile analysis do not reveal any association which be in accordance with previous finding show no relationship between QTc interval and plasma lumefantrine concentration The linear regression analysis however suggest a possible relation between lumefantrine Cmax and QTc prolongation P Bazetts formula P Fridericias formula but the calculate P value should be interpret with caution give the exploratory nature of the pharmacokinetic assessment In conclusion the new pediatric formulation of artemetherlumefantrine dispersible tablet appear to provide adequate systemic exposure to artemether DHA and lumefantrine in infant and child with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in Africa which result in the desire clinical outcome The use of dispersible tablet may contribute to good treatment outcome and delay the development of drug resistanceACKNOWLEDGMENTS Novartis Pharma sponsor this trial as part of the clinical development program for the new pediatric

driver of functional process in desert include carbon and nitrogen cycle in this ecosystem For instance a recent study which reconstruct bacterial genome from Antarctic hypoliths show that this community harbor xanthorhodopsinlike protein and Napumpinglike rhodopsin Yet fundamental ecological question regard the role play by virus as driver of diversification and trophic cycle in hypoliths remain unclear Antarctic desert hypolithic community in particular have be show to contain substantial viral population dominate by tail bacteriophage of the order Caudovirales â Microarray analysis of lithic niche identify a even great phage diversity include signature of RNA bacteriophage of the family Leviviridae ssDNA phage of the family Microviridae and nontailed dsDNA tectiviruses Together this observation suggest that phage may play a important role in microbial community structure and function The presence of active bacteriophage in a microbial community inevitably lead to the evolution of specialize bacterial defensive measure and a diverse range of bacterial defense mechanism against parasitic phage have be identify this include adaptive immunity element such as the CRISPRCas system and innate immunity mechanism such as restrictionmodification RM and toxinantitoxin abortive infection Abi system Recent pangenomic study have also identify novel defense system that be widely distribute across bacterial taxon and be think to play a role in antiphage resistance â this include the bacteriophage exclusion BREX system encode by a to gene cluster that provide resistance to Siphoviridae and Myoviridae tail phage by inhibition of phage DNA replication and other little good characterize system such as the Thoeris Shedu and Gabija element that increase bacterial host resistance to specific group of phage combine the valuable evidence on phage diversity and prevalence in polar desert soil we hypothesize that phagehost interaction play a important role in shape the structure of edaphic microbial community in this environment To test our hypothesis we assess the know bacterial defense system in metagenomic sequence datum derive from a niche Antarctic hypolith community We be able to link a portion of this datum to specific phage genome and propose that phage play a active role in shape the immunity of Antarctic soil microbial communitiesRESULTS The distribution of antiphage defense mechanism show a diversity of innate immunity gene The distribution of antiphage defense system in the metagenome be determine by map defense

contribute of the total gene hit for antiphage defense system On the other side of the spectrum the defense system Shedu Hachiman and CRISPRtype be present at relatively low abundance and therefore have little apparent contribution to the global defense system distribution The average contribution of defense gene to the total gene count per phylum be with Deferribacteres and âCandidatus

phage virulence TableÂ the much abundant of which encode methyltransferase which be actively involve in the evasion of the RM system This result suggest the possibility of a evolutionary pressure for the phage to develop evasion mechanism against their host which far hint at active phagehost dynamic in this longenduring Antarctic hypoliths DISCUSSION Due to the relatively simple trophic structure in cold desert system include Antarctic soil cryptic microbial community be consider to be important driver of local ecosystem service However the extent to which this community be influence by phage remain largely unexplore Such interaction may shape the diversification and community interaction in cold desert system Qualitative survey of Antarctic metaviromics have report a high diversity of virus associate with microbial community of open soil and cryptic niche Evidence albeit limit that Antarctic soil phage exist predominantly in a lysogenic rather than lytic lifestyle have lead to suggestion that the functional role of phage in this spatially restrict waterconstrained desert soil niche may be limit The result present in this study provide the first evidence of interaction between phage and host in this psychrophilic edaphic environment This be much evident in the correlation between the metavirome of the hypolith community and the CRISPRarrays which suggest the active evolution of the adaptive immune system against local viral threat This idea of community adaption to local phage threat be far imply by the positive correlation between the CRISPR array and virus extract from local soil In fact a previous study have already suggest that recruitment from surround soil play a important role in the development of hypoliths and this may also be extend to the recruitment of phage from the surround ecosystem Another indication of active interaction between phage and host be suggest by the presence of several methyltransferase in the metagenomeassembled viral contig which be a hallmark of viral evasion against native host RM system Other gene find in this set of virome contig include gene specifically involve in the degradation of biofilm matrix and evasion against RM system far suggest a complex network of interaction at play between phage and their host in the hypolithic environment While the metagenomics datum analyze in this study do not give a direct indication of the temporal scale of the phagehost interaction occur in the hypolith the short size of CRISPRarray size in the hypolith metagenome suggest a low frequency of infection This low frequency be far hint at when compare the hypolith CRISPRarray size with that of a much fluid and homogenous environment where viralhost interaction be assume to be a frequent occurrence Together this result imply a model for viralhost interaction in hypoliths that follow the âstaticstepstaticâ development model suggest by point et al drive by the stochastic and intermittent nature of rain event in such waterlimited ecosystem A surprise result from this study be the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity system the much prominent of which be the BREX and DISARM system While this two system have be show to be widespread in bacterium use a pangenomic datum set the present study represent the first evidence for the prevalence of this system in ecological sample As such this result imply that noncanonical innate immunity be much important for antiphage microbial community defense than previously think and should therefore be the focus for future study into innate immunity in the ecological context There be also indication from the hypolith metagenome that the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity over traditional RM and Abi system for defense against phage be relate to the adaptation of the hypolith community to specific local viral population For instance the Zorya system the 3 much prevalent noncanonical immunity system in the metagenome be hypothesize to operate similarly to the Abi system In turn Zorya system provide resistance against a limit range of phage include the ssDNA family Microviridae which have be show to be prevalent in Antarctic aquatic and soil niche Conclusion Together this result be not consistent with the suggestion that the constraint of the environment such as low temperature low aw and result limit capacity for interparticle diffusion lead to extremely localize phagehost interaction Rather the datum be suggestive of a dynamic and continual interaction between host and phage Nevertheless interparticle communication and exchange may be limit to brief period when bulk liquid water be present such as after snow melt for example Furthermore the low metabolic rate the inevitable consequence of Arrhenius effect temperature dependence of reaction rate in cold environment should also limit the rate at which phage can replicate and propagate far limit the frequency of interaction with their host We suggest that the localize nature of hostphage interaction in the hypolith niche and the limit interparticle communication where bacterial host be not frequently challenge by novel phage threat lead to a reliance of microbial community on innate immunity as the primary defense against phage infection The small size of CRISPR array in the Antarctic soil metagenome sequence compare to that from a temperate aquatic environment and the underrepresentation of CRISPR system give far credence to the temporally sporadic interaction between phage and their host Nevertheless the correlation between the metavirome and the CRIPRcas array together with the presence of bacteriophage evasion gene in the metavirome suggest that phagehost interaction within the hypolith community be a dynamic process that lead to coevolution of both phage and host We therefore suggest that phage play a hitherto underestimate role in drive the evolution of Antarctic soil microbial community by shape their collective immunityMATERIALS AND method Sample collection DNA extraction and metagenomic sequence The sample collection DNA extraction and metagenomic sequence protocol use in this study have be describe

the combination of both abiotic and biotic stressor result in simple trophic level dominate by microbiomes Although the past two decade have reveal substantial insight regard the diversity and structure of microbiomes we lack mechanistic insight regard community interaction and how phage may affect this By provide the first evidence of widespread antiphage innate immunity we shed light on phagehost dynamic in Antarctic niche community Our analysis reveal several antiphage defense system include DISARM and BREX which appear to dominate in cold desert niche community In contrast our analysis reveal that gene which encode antiphage adaptive immunity be underrepresent in this community suggest low infection frequency in cold edaphic environment We propose that by actively challenge niche community phage play crucial role in the diversification of Antarctic community INTRODUCTION Antarctic terrestrial environment include open soil permafrost and the surface and interior of rock be typically oligotrophic and dominate by psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microbial community â It have be suggest that the extreme abiotic pressure of the environment such as temperature desiccation stress and UV radiation be dominant driver of both the diversity and function of coldadapted bacterial community in terrestrial polar desert â Similarly biotic interaction such as competition symbiosis horizontal gene transfer HGT and predation have also be show to play a role in the distribution and diversity of microbial community in this soil ecosystem â The presence of virus include bacteriophage henceforth term phage in this cold hyperarid desert soil potentially add a additional layer of complexity to the microbial system but the extent to which phagehost interaction play a role in shape community composition and process in cold desert soil niche remain a matter of speculation Hypoliths photosynthetic assemblage find below translucent rock be widely

imply that noncanonical innate immunity be much important for antiphage microbial community defense than previously think and should therefore be the focus for future study into innate immunity in the ecological context There be also indication from the hypolith metagenome that the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity over traditional RM and Abi system for defense against phage be relate to the adaptation of the hypolith community to specific local viral population For instance the Zorya system the 3 much prevalent noncanonical immunity system in the metagenome be hypothesize to operate similarly to the Abi system In turn Zorya system provide resistance against a limit range of phage include the ssDNA family Microviridae which have be show to be prevalent in Antarctic aquatic and soil niche Conclusion Together this result be not consistent with the suggestion that the constraint of the environment such as low temperature low aw and result limit capacity for interparticle diffusion lead to extremely localize phagehost interaction Rather the datum be suggestive of a dynamic and continual interaction between host and phage Nevertheless interparticle communication and exchange may be limit to brief period when bulk liquid water be present such as after snow melt for example Furthermore the low metabolic rate the inevitable consequence of Arrhenius effect temperature dependence of reaction rate in cold environment should also limit the rate at which phage can replicate and propagate far limit the frequency of interaction with their host We suggest that the localize nature of hostphage interaction in the hypolith niche and the limit interparticle communication where bacterial host be not frequently challenge by novel phage threat lead to a reliance of microbial community on innate immunity as the primary defense against phage infection The small size of CRISPR array in the Antarctic soil metagenome sequence compare to that from a temperate aquatic environment and the underrepresentation of CRISPR system give far credence to the temporally sporadic interaction between phage and their host Nevertheless the correlation between the metavirome and the CRIPRcas array together with the presence of bacteriophage evasion gene in the metavirome suggest that phagehost interaction within the hypolith community be a dynamic process that lead to coevolution of both phage and host We therefore suggest that phage play a hitherto underestimate role in drive the evolution of Antarctic soil microbial community by shape their collective immunityMATERIALS AND method Sample collection DNA extraction and metagenomic sequence The sample collection DNA extraction and metagenomic sequence protocol use in this study have be describe

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00880-19","Zinc homeostasis be crucial for bacterial cell since imbalance affect viability However in mycobacterium knowledge of zinc metabolism be incomplete Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG be a environmental nonpathogenic Mycobacterium that be widely use as a model organism to study mycobacterial metabolism and pathogenicity How MSMEG maintain zinc homeostasis be largely unknown SmtB and Zur be important regulator of bacterial zinc metabolism In mycobacterium this regulator be encode by a operon whereas in other bacterial species SmtB and Zur be encode on separate locus Here we show that the smtBzur operon be consistently present within the genus Mycobacterium but otherwise find only in Nocardia Saccharothrix and Corynebacterium diphtheriae By RNA deep sequence we determine the Zur and SmtB regulons of MSMEG and compare them with transcriptional response after zinc starvation or excess We find a exceptional genomic cluster of gene whose expression be strongly induce by zur deletion and zinc starvation this gene encode zinc importer such as ZnuABC and three additional putative zinc transporter include the porin MspD as good as alternative ribosomal protein In contrast only a few gene be affect by deletion of smtB and zinc excess The zinc exporter ZitA be much prominently regulate by SmtB Moreover transcriptional analysis in combination with promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal a special regulation of the smtBzur operon itself a apparently zincindependent constitutive expression of smtBzur result from sensitive coregulation by both SmtB and Zur Overall our datum reveal yet unknown peculiarity of mycobacterial zinc homeostasis INTRODUCTION In live eukaryotic and bacterial cell zinc play a essential role in numerous cellular process such as DNA replication transcription translation DNA bind and many enzymatic reaction Thus it be essential for the survival of eukaryote and bacterium However as with iron and copper the bioavailability of zinc be very low Hence depend on their environmental niche bacterium be expose to various zinc concentration Zinc and other trace metal also play a role in innate immunity For example macrophage can actively fend off bacterial infection by increase or deplete zinc thereby cause either intoxication or starvation of the bacterium nutritional immunity Therefore in the environment as good as in the host bacterium need mechanism to efficiently regulate zinc homeostasis Zinc homeostasis be achieve by the expression of regulate or nonregulated specific or nonspecific energydependent or independent system Cation diffusion facilitator CDFs such as CzcD of Bacillus subtilis and ZitB of Escherichia coli allow regulate specific ATPindependent uptake or efflux whereas the activity of specific lowaffinity zinc importer of the ZIP family eg ZupT of E coli or highaffinity transporter such as Ptype ATPases eg ZntA of E coli and CtpC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB be mostly ATP dependent The much prominent family of inducible highaffinity bacterial zinc transporter be the common ATP bind cassette ABC importer ZnuABC which be a important virulence factor in many bacterium eg E coli Salmonella enterica Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia pestis â bacterium be able to sense alteration of intracellular zinc concentration in the femtomolar range by zincresponsive regulator They regulate the expression of zinc uptake export or storage system example include DtxR diphtheria toxin regulatorlike regulator such as TroR of Treponema pallidum MerR metalresponsive regulatorlike regulator such as ZntR of E coli and ArsR arsenitesensitive regulatorlike repressor such as SmtB of Synechococcus species and CzrA of Staphylococcus aureus and Zur zinc uptake regulator also know as FurB of MTB a member of the Fur ferric uptake regulator family â Knowledge of zinc homeostasis and its regulation in mycobacterium be very limit much information concern pathogenic species be base on heterologous study in the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG this study indicate that the antagonistically act repressor SmtB and Zur regulate zinc homeostasis by use zinc as a cofactor Thereby they regulate bacterial response to change intracellular zinc availability by activate or repress the expression of importer or exporter gene During starvation apoZur be release from the DNA allow zinc import by derepression of zinc importer gene such as MTB znuABC and yciC Similar activity of Zur be observe in the ruminant pathogen Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis MAP HoloSmtB detach from the DNA when zinc be in excess thereby allow gene transcription of zinc exporter such as ZitA of MTB Zincdependent regulation of smtB expression have be demonstrate for MTB and MAP In this species SmtB have be show to be cotranscribed with Zur from a operon here refer to as smtBzur which seem to be autoregulated by SmtB Cotranscription and autoregulation have also be propose for MSMEG suggest a general regulation concept of the operon in mycobacterium Little be know about the influence of zinc on gene expression in mycobacterium The regulons of MTB Zur and the zinc starvation regulon of MAP have be identify this study reveal a Zurdependent and zinc starvationdependent induction of a set of gene which encode alternative ribosomal protein ARPs ARPs in contrast to their zinccontaining paralogues do not use zinc as a structural component In addition the virulenceassociated mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX the zinc importer znuABC and CobWlike chaperone be all induce upon Zur deletion or zinc starvation However direct involvement of Zur in regulation be base on bind site prediction only and be not experimentally confirm Knowledge of the role of SmtB in zinc homeostasis in mycobacterium be limit to prediction of its bind site in MTB and study of its promoter in MSMEG In nonpathogenic mycobacterium eg MSMEG very few study have be publish on zinc homeostasis this include the presence of a zitA homologue the zincdependent DNA repair protein KU which be important for zinc resistance and the involvement of mycobacterial protein Y MPY in the hibernation of alternative ribosome In the present study we apply a comprehensive transcriptional approach to investigate the smtBzur operon of mycobacterium in the context of MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as good as the regulons of SmtB and Zur Our result provide novel insight into zincdependent gene regulation in MSMEG and reveal additional putative zinc transport system Moreover we demonstrate the relevance of SmtB and Zur during zinc stress and starvation and characterize detail of their own regulation The result indicate that the regulation of zinc homeostasis in MSMEG be much complex than that in pathogenic mycobacterium Overall we provide novel finding which contribute to our understand of mycobacterial response to change zinc concentrationsRESULTS The smtBzur operon structure be conserve in mycobacterium Regulation of zinc homeostasis in mycobacterium be achieve by the antagonistic activity of the regulator SmtB and Zur this regulator be also present in other bacterial genus but in contrast to mycobacterium they be encode on separate gene which be not organize in a operon Hence we be interest in whether this organization be specific for mycobacterium We perform phylogenetic analysis base on the sequence of smtBzur of MSMEG in NCBI BLASTN and subsequent neighborhood join analysis Of the strain harbor the smtBzur operon be mycobacterial strain They can be group into mainly environmentalnonpathogenic and mainly pathogenic species The remain three strain be genus of the phylum Actinobacteria eg Nocardia species and Saccharothrix species FigÂ Furthermore a operon be also find in Corynebacterium diphtheriae but with significantly low sequence homology Thus the arrangement of smtBzur on a operon as present in mycobacterium be otherwise observe only in a very small group of actinobacteria Operon structure be confirm in select species by extract the genome region homologous to MSMEG zur and smtB and by perform multiple sequence alignment The code sequence homologous to zur and smtB be overlap in MSMEG Mycobacterium thermoresistibile MTB and Saccharothrix espanaensis In Nocardia asteroides the two code sequence be separate by bp see FigÂ S in the supplemental material Zur and SmtB contribute to zinc resistance in MSMEG To get much insight into the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis of MSMEG we determine their regulons For this we use the previously publish regulator mutant MSMEGÎzur and generate the deletion mutant MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur as good as the complement strain MSMEGÎsmtBC MSMEGÎzurC and MSMEGÎsmtBCÎzurC Mutation complementation and polar effect on the adjacent gene MSMEG be control by quantitative realtime PCR qRTPCR FigÂ S As expect smtB expression be abolish in MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur but still present in MSMEGÎzur Vice versa expression of zur be observe in MSMEGÎsmtB but be not detectable in MSMEGÎzur or MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur Interestingly expression of smtB be high in MSMEGÎzur and expression of zur be high in MSMEGÎsmtB than in the wild type suggest that both regulator contribute to their own expression Complementation restore the wildtype phenotype mRNA expression of the respective gene on the integrate complementation vector be high in the complement strain than in the wild type The adjacent gene MSMEG be express in all mutate strain FigÂ S Growth kinetic of all strain be monitor in standard MB see material and method Growth of MSMEGÎsmtB and the double mutant MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur be comparable to that of the wild type FigÂ A and C Only MSMEGÎzur show a significantly reduce growth and have enter the stationary phase already after h Complementation restore the wildtype phenotype FigÂ B To analyze difference in zinc tolerance of the different mutant we use a plate assay with increase zinc concentration Briefly strain be spread on agar and ZnSO be apply to filter disc in increase concentration No growth inhibition be visible with water control At low ZnSO concentration âmM growth of MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎzur be significantly impair as indicate by a large zone of growth inhibition ZoI which be not observe for wildtype MSMEG MSMEGwt and the complement strain FigÂ have and E The double mutant show significantly reduce growth at high concentration or âmM FigÂ F Hence all mutant be affect in growth much likely by impair ability to maintain zinc homeostasis response of MSMEG to change in zinc homeostasis The abovedescribed datum suggest a involvement of SmtB and Zur in control of zinc homeostasis To far dissect the underlie molecular mechanism we analyze the transcriptional response of MSMEGwt culture treat with the zinc chelator TPEN NNNâ²Nâ²tetrakis pyridylmethyl ethylenediamine âÎ¼M or expose to ZnSO âÎ¼M Gene expression be determine by RNA deep sequence RNASeq and the transcriptome of MSMEG treat with TPEN or expose to ZnSO be compare to that of the untreated control Zinc starvation upon TPEN treatment result in the differential expression of gene FigÂ A TableÂ which be organize in operon as predict by Rockhopper analysis high expression be observe for gene and low expression for gene much than of the differentially express gene exhibit to fold change this gene encode protein involve in energy conversion MSMEG MSMEG transport MSMEG gene regulation MSMEG and stress and immune response MSMEG MSMEG other be involve in metabolic and enzymatic process MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG or be of unknown function MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG Differentially express gene with a fold change of â¥ comprise the gene MSMEG and MSMEG encode hypothetical protein and a special cluster of gene MSMEG which be much highly express after zinc starvation FigÂ C This cluster comprise gene encode four putative transporter MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG include the common ZnuABC transporter MSMEG two CobWlike protein MSMEG and MSMEG the latter represent the recently describe mycobacteriumspecific protein Y MPY recruitment factor MRF a set of gene encode zincindependent alternative ribosomal protein ARPs RpsR RpsN RpmG RpmB and RpmE MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG a gene encode the porin MspD MSMEG and two gene of unknown function MSMEG MSMEG In addition â¥foldlower expression upon TPEN treatment be observe for the cobaltzinccadmium resistance gene MSMEG The encode protein belong to the group of CDF transporter be closely relate to the PBtype ATPase CzcD and be a putative homologue of the zinc exporter ZitA MSMEG respond to zinc excess by differential expression of only gene ie with high expression and with low expression compare to the untreated control TableÂ They be predict to be involve in transcriptionregulation MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG metabolic or enzymatic process MSMEG MSMEG stress response MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG and metal transport MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG or be of unknown function MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG Moreover the expression of MSMEG and MSMEG be reduce upon zinc addition this gene encode a PadR family transcription regulator and a synthase involve in myoinositolphosphate MIP generation respectively The MIP protein have be show to form a complex with zinc Within the group of gene with high expression we find a gene cluster putatively involve in zinc transport MSMEG and a proline dehydrogenase MSMEG However the much prominently affect gene of the zinc stress transcriptome be MSMEG which be strongly induce upon zinc excess and as show above have low expression upon zinc starvation TableÂ This support the hypothesis that MSMEG be involve in zinc export Overall the MSMEG response to zinc limitation involve a large numb of gene associate with zinc homeostasis The response to zinc excess however be little pronounce as it cause only moderate change in gene expression and much of this gene can not be assign to zinc homeostasisSmtB and Zur control zinc homeostasis To dissect the relevance of MSMEG SmtB and Zur for zinc homeostasis we determine the regulons of both regulator by RNA sequence of the respective mutant and the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant Differentially express gene be compare with that of zinc starvation and stress regulons to determine the zinc dependency of SmtBZurregulated gene Transcriptome analysis of the MSMEGÎzur mutant reveal differentially express gene compare to MSMEGwt Differential expression of of this gene be congruent with the TPEN or zinc stress transcriptome FigÂ A and C They be classify as Zur and zinc dependently regulate gene TableÂ The remain gene be consider Zur dependent but zinc independently regulate TableÂ In the group of zincdependent gene which be all but four much highly express in the mutant than in the wild type we find several extremely highly induce gene to fold change this include gene encode ARPs MSMEG and MSMEG as good as two gene code for CobWlike protein MSMEG MSMEG and a putative ABC transporter MSMEG In addition a numb of gene encode other predict cation transporter MSMEG MSMEG the predict ZnuABC importer MSMEG the porin MspD MSMEG as good as three gene of unknown function MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG and one code for a methyltransferase MSMEG be classify as Zur and zinc dependent The majority of zincindependent gene differentially express in MSMEGÎzur show only weak difference in expression compare to the wild type However we find some interest cluster eg one encode a group of chaperone MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG and one a iron uptake system MSMEG which be much highly express in the mutant whereas gene cluster involve in the EntnerDoudoroff pathway MSMEG ectoine synthesis express at high salt concentration MSMEG and other metabolic pathway MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG show reduce expression compare to the wild type Two gene be highly affect by zur deletion but be zinc independent expression of MSMEG smtB be â¼fold increase and transcription of MSMEG code for a putative LppH protein be strongly repress â¼fold The function of the latter gene be unknown The SmtB regulon be relatively small Overall only gene be differentially express Of this only five belong exclusively to the SmtB regulon FigÂ A TableÂ Five gene be also present in the Zur regulon Two gene be SmtB and zinc dependent MSMEG MSMEG Only the expression of the cobaltzinccadmium resistance gene MSMEG be affect by smtB deletion and TPEN and zinc treatment While its expression be decrease â¼fold upon zinc starvation and induce â¼fold upon zinc excess smtB deletion result in a â¼fold increase of expression In the group of zincindependent gene we find two poorly characterize transcriptional regulator gene MSMEG MSMEG zur MSMEG one gene involve in metabolism MSMEG and a gene encode a protein of the ferritin family MSMEG All this gene be much highly express in the mutant We then compare the Zur and SmtB regulons with the transcriptome of the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant Among differentially express gene in MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur see TableÂ S in the supplemental material with a fold change expression of gene be congruent with gene of the single mutant regulons FigÂ B Hence expression of of the gene regulate by Zur and SmtB of differentially express gene in total be also affect in the double mutant The remain gene can be assign mostly to metabolism and stress response possibly due to the metal imbalance and be regulate by other regulatorsPrediction and distribution of Zur and SmtB bind motif in MSMEG To emphasize the direct involvement of SmtB and Zur in regulation we be next interest in identification of putative bind motif in the regulatory element of regulate gene We screen the MSMEG genome for putative SmtB and Zur bind site by use of the MEME Suite and subsequent FIMO analysis Due to the complex architecture of mycobacterial promoter which can extend up to âkb and the possible presence of much than one functional Zur box upstream of gene we consider motif which be find in the â² untranslated region UTR up to ââbp upstream of predict open read frame ORFs as putative bind site Of motif for Zur be find in the choose â² UTR of ORFs TableÂ Among that we find motif locate in the promoteroperator region of Zurregulated gene TableÂ indicate by boldface and TablesÂ and indicate by asterisk ie the predict ZnuABC transporter MSMEG and a 2 ABC transporter MSMEG four CobWlike protein MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG a methyltransferase MSMEG and the set of gene encode ARPs MSMEG MSMEG Some promoteroperators harbor much than one predict motif MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG which suggest a complex regulation of this gene as already describe for Streptomyces coelicolor and Cupriavidus metallidurans Notably smtBzur be also precede by a putative Zur bind site SmtB motif prediction by the MEME Suite base on the promoter sequence of the gene of the MSMEG SmtB regulon be not successful due to the low numb of gene Therefore we use in our FIMO analysis the putative SmtB bind site of MTB which be previously predict from in vitro bind assay with smtBzur promoter fragment However we be unable to confirm the presence of a SmtB bind site upstream of smtBzur of MSMEG zitA be regulate by SmtB FIMO analysis of the MSMEG genome do not predict any conclusive SmtB bind site neither for smtBzur nor for any other SmtBregulated gene even though smtBzur transcription repression by SmtB have be previously propose for MTB and MSMEG To dissect the relevance of SmtB in the regulation of gene in MSMEG we analyze MSMEG the zitA homologue of MSMEG whose expression be strongly induce in the MSMEGÎsmtB mutant and which show significant homology to other CDF transporter Since MSMEG have also be propose as a gene homologue of zitA we first analyze expression of both gene upon zinc stress We observe a concentrationdependent induction of MSMEG but not of MSMEG FigÂ A confirm the relevance of MSMEG in zinc homeostasis In a next step we fuse the promoter of MSMEG FigÂ B to lacZ use the expression vector pJEM and analyze promoter activity by a Î²galactosidase assay in MSMEGwt and MSMEGÎsmtB under standard condition and upon zinc starvation TPEN or zinc excess ZnSO this analysis reveal that promoter activity be significantly induce upon zinc stress in MSMEGwt and constantly high under all condition in MSMEGÎsmtB FigÂ C To analyze a direct involvement of SmtB in MSMEG regulation we perform chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP experiment MSMEGÎsmtB be complement with Flagtagged SmtB and DNAprotein complex be precipitate after crosslinking with a antibody target the Flag tag or a isogenic IgG control antibody DNA from ChIP be quantify by qRTPCR with primer target the MSMEG promoter and additionally with primer target the promoter of smtBzur which be include as a SmtB but zinc independently regulate gene as good as intragenic control primer locate in MSMEG and in the zur gene As show in FigÂ have ChIP lead to the significant enrichment of MSMEG promoter DNA but not however of the smtBzur promoter or the intragenic control when grow under standard condition This indicate that SmtB bind to the MSMEG promoter despite the absence of a SmtB bind motif similar to MTB but suggest the presence of a different SmtB bind site which have to be identify in future experiment Regulation of smtBzur expression be dependent on both regulator Transcriptional analysis of the smtB and zur deletion mutant suggest that both SmtB and Zur regulate their own expression since deletion of one regulator affect the expression of the other This regulation be independent of zinc table and FigÂ S The datum show above however suggest that SmtB play a inferior role in regulation as no bind of SmtB to the promoter be visible under standard condition FigÂ have this finding be in contrast to that in other mycobacterium as smtB expression be zinc dependent in MAP and regulate by SmtB in MTB Therefore we study the relevance of Zur and SmtB on MSMEG smtBzur regulation in much detail First we analyze promoter activity of the smtBzur promoter after transformation of MSMEGwt MSMEGÎzur MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur with pJEMsmtB FigÂ A As show in FigÂ B promoter activity be significantly enhance in all mutant compare to that in the wild type Upon TPEN or ZnSO treatment no change in promoter activity be observe in the wild type or in the double mutant In contrast in MSMEGÎzur zinc depletion result in reduce promoter activity and zinc excess result in high promoter activity In MSMEGÎsmtB promoter activity be low upon ZnSO treatment and increase upon addition of TPEN This indicate that in MSMEGÎzur the remain regulator SmtB bind to the promoter when zinc be absent whereas in MSMEGÎsmtB Zur bind to the promoter when zinc be present FigÂ Remarkably zincdependent regulation be detectable only in the absence of the other regulator Unlike with MTB a Zur bind site but no comprehensive SmtB bind motif can be identify by FIMO analysis in the smtB promoter of MSMEG Thus we perform ChIP analysis to elucidate the zincdependent direct bind of both regulator to their respective promoter use MSMEGÎsmtB express Flagtagged SmtB and MSMEGÎzur complement with hemagglutinin HAtagged Zur As show in FigÂ C the amount of DNA of the smtB promoter be significantly enrich after Zur ChIP antiHA whereas no enrichment be observe after SmtB ChIP antiFlag and in the intragenic zur control FigÂ have demonstrate direct bind of Zur to the promoter region of smtBzur under standard growth condition Exposure of the bacterium to change zinc concentration influence promoter bind of the regulator Zur bind be significantly reduce upon zinc starvation TPEN but increase upon addition of zinc indicate by the depletion or enrichment of DNA of the smtBzur promoter region respectively FigÂ C Enrichment of promoter DNA after SmtB ChIP be visible only when zinc be deplete by TPEN FigÂ have this datum clearly show that in MSMEG Zur and SmtB replace each other to regulate their own expression in response to zinc availability FigÂ DISCUSSION Despite the importance of zinc in mycobacterial metabolism only a few study have be publish on mycobacterial zinc homeostasis The importance of zinc be deduce mostly from study focus on mycobacterial pathogen All information concern the transcriptional regulation of zinc homeostasis regulator SmtB and Zur have be obtain in MSMEG by heterologous expression of the MTB smtB and MSMEG smtB promoter Our transcriptomic analysis of the MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as good as the transcriptome of MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎzur mutant reveal a complete and complex picture of zincdependent gene regulation in MSMEG much gene in MSMEG affect by zinc encode already know or putative zinc transport system as good as chaperone and alternative ribosomal protein ARPs The know and common importer znuABC MSMEG be induce upon zinc starvation and Zur deletion in MSMEG This find be comparable to Zurcontrolled homologous znuABC in MTB and MAP transporter MAPc Similar to other bacterium MSMEG regulate expression of CobWlike protein upon zinc starvation Homologous gene in MAP and MTB have be show to be regulate zinc dependently by Zur In Cupriavidus metallidurans CobW protein substitute for miss zinc importer During zinc starvation expression of gene rpmB rpmG rpsN rpsR and rpmE encode ARPs be highly induce and regulate by Zur ARPs do not need zinc as a structural component and support MSMEG survival upon zinc limitation high expression of such gene under limit zinc condition have also be describe for MTB MAP Bacillus subtilis Streptomyces coelicolor and other bacterium concern zinc export in MSMEG our result reveal that expression of the zinc exporter MSMEG ZitA encode by MSMEG be directly regulate by SmtB which be in accordance with finding on MTB ZitA Thus MSMEG seem to possess zinc storage and transport mechanism similar to that of pathogenic mycobacterium However in contrast to pathogenic mycobacterium the MSMEG zinc regulon comprise additional putative zinc uptake system such as the predict Zn uptake transporter encode by MSMEG or mspD MSMEG The Mycobacterium smegmatis porins Msp represent a group of four highly similar protein MspA to have specific for mycobacterium MspA be involve in the uptake of glucose phosphate amino acid and iron and MspC be involve in copper uptake and growth MspD differ from the other Msps in amino acid only but no substrate specificity have be describe so far Our study indicate that MspD may play a role in zinc uptake and may presumably provide a additional rapid channelbased exchange system for nutrient Remarkably MSMEG which be part of the MSMEG operon show no homology to gene of pathogenic mycobacterium but to MVAN of the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii This gene be predict to be part of a 2 Zurregulated znuABC transporter Due to the observe high expression in MSMEG treat with TPEN and in MSMEGÎzur the transporter operon MSMEG may therefore encode a additional zinc importer in MSMEG With regard to mycobacterial phylogeny the absence of this transport system in pathogenic mycobacterium suggest a good zinc availability in the host In the concept of phylogenetic adaptation of pathogen to their host this may have lead to the loss of additional uptake system Our analysis unravel the transcriptional regulation of the MSMEG smtBzur operon The result indicate that in MSMEG as with zinc import regulation of zinc homeostasis also seem to be much complex than in pathogenic mycobacterium SmtB and Zur be both sensitive measure of zinc concentration in other bacterium Expression of the operon be autoregulated by SmtB in MTB andor be zinc dependent as show for MAP Here we find that in MSMEGwt expression of smtB and zur be unaffected when zinc be either absent or in excess table and see FigÂ S in the supplemental material This find be in accordance with that in S coelicolor in which the amount of Zur protein under high or low zinc condition remain constant Strikingly the apparently constitutive expression of smtBzur in MSMEG be maintain by SmtB and Zur depend on the availability of zinc We find that both regulator affect the expression of their operon Our promoter study with the regulator deletion mutant reveal that both SmtB and Zur be need for full regulatory control of their operon promoter Furthermore we show that the regulation of smtBzur expression be hierarchic Zur seem to dominate the control and repress expression of the operon when zinc be freely available for the bacterium FigÂ B We far show antagonistic bind of one regulator to the operator in the absence of the other FigÂ C and have Hence even in the case of imbalance in zinc homeostasis expression of the operon be never uncontrolled The importance of control smtBzur expression be also indicate by our zone of inhibition ZoI assay Fig have to F They show that differential gene expression in MSMEG lack Zur or SmtB result in reduce zinc tolerance which be not observable when both regulator be absent in the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant Thus the regulons of Zur and SmtB be necessary for maintain MSMEG zinc homeostasis If uncontrolled differential gene expression alone cannot cope with zinc imbalance which be illustrate by the reduce zinc tolerance of the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant when expose to high zinc concentration in the ZoI assay However the quality of zinc imbalance in the MSMEG single mutant need to be clarify in future experiment The antagonistic influence of Zur and SmtB on smtBzur expression have not yet be report for other bacterium On first glance such a autoregulation seem to be peculiar However a close look reveal that it be necessary for a sensitive control of zinc homeostasis In the case of sole regulation by Zur the operon would be derepressed upon zinc limitation This may lead to excessive synthesis of apoZur and may delay or impair the shutdown of zinc importer when zinc be sufficiently available Moreover additional SmtB produce simultaneously would impair its own deactivation and block zinc export to avoid zinc excess On the other hand sole regulation by SmtB would allow operon expression exclusively when MSMEG encounter a excess of zinc or it would depend on the halflife of SmtB since SmtB bind to the DNA in its apo form FigÂ have and A This mechanism may be likely in organism with stable zinc homeostasis However due to limit apoZur production this mechanism would be disadvantageous for control zinc import after starvation Therefore the good capability to react quickly to change zinc concentration may also explain why Zur be the dominate regulator in this complex regulatory mechanism The dominance of Zur also make sense as the environmental bioavailability of zinc be presumably low Accordingly in liquid culture growth of MSMEG be hamper only in the absence of zur FigÂ B which may be explain by a uncontrolled zinc influx due to the lack of counterregulation This however need to be prove by additional study in the future In pathogenic MTB smtBzur regulation seem to be solely affect by SmtB This suggest that mycobacterium in the host be expose to much constant or high zinc concentration than they be in the environment which would make regulation by SmtB much plausible and may reflect another example of mycobacterial adaptation to the host Overall in the present study we provide novel insight into the response of MSMEG to change zinc concentration We show that MSMEG be good adapt to environmental change in zinc availability This be achieve by a sensitive regulation of the smtBzur operon by both Zur and SmtB allow a balance expression of the two regulator even under change zinc concentration and by the presence of additional putative zinc transporter in the genome this mechanism enable MSMEG to maintain reactivity and to constantly control intracellular zinc homeostasisMATERIALS AND method Bacterial

it be a essential cofactor of enzyme and a structural component of regulatory and DNA bind protein Hence all live cell require zinc to maintain constant intracellular level However in excess zinc be toxic Therefore cellular zinc homeostasis need to be tightly control In bacterium this be achieve by transcriptional regulator whose activity be mediate via zincdependent conformational change promote or prevent their bind to DNA SmtB and Zur be important antagonistically act bacterial regulator in mycobacterium They sense change in zinc concentration in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of gene for zinc acquisition storage and export Here we analyze the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis in Mycobacterium smegmatis Our result reveal novel insight into the transcriptional process of zinc homeostasis in mycobacterium and their regulation INTRODUCTION In live eukaryotic and bacterial cell zinc play a essential role in numerous cellular process such as DNA replication transcription translation DNA bind and many enzymatic reaction Thus it be essential for the survival of eukaryote and bacterium However as with iron and copper the bioavailability of zinc be very low Hence depend on their environmental niche bacterium be expose to various zinc concentration Zinc and other trace metal also play a role in innate immunity For example macrophage can actively fend off bacterial infection by increase or deplete zinc thereby cause either intoxication or starvation of the bacterium nutritional immunity Therefore in the environment as good as in the host bacterium need mechanism to efficiently regulate zinc homeostasis Zinc homeostasis be achieve by the expression of regulate or nonregulated specific or nonspecific energydependent or independent system Cation diffusion facilitator CDFs such as CzcD of Bacillus subtilis and ZitB of Escherichia coli allow regulate specific ATPindependent uptake or efflux whereas the activity of specific lowaffinity zinc importer of the ZIP family eg ZupT of E coli or highaffinity transporter such as Ptype ATPases eg ZntA of E coli and CtpC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB be mostly ATP dependent The much prominent family of inducible highaffinity bacterial zinc transporter be the common ATP bind cassette ABC importer ZnuABC which be a important virulence factor in many bacterium eg E coli Salmonella enterica Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia pestis â bacterium be able to sense alteration of intracellular zinc concentration in the femtomolar range by zincresponsive regulator They regulate the expression of zinc uptake export or storage system example include DtxR diphtheria toxin regulatorlike regulator such as TroR of Treponema pallidum MerR metalresponsive regulatorlike regulator such as ZntR of E coli and ArsR arsenitesensitive regulatorlike repressor such as SmtB of Synechococcus species and CzrA of Staphylococcus aureus and Zur zinc uptake regulator also know as FurB of MTB a member of the Fur ferric uptake regulator family â Knowledge of zinc homeostasis and its regulation in mycobacterium be very limit much information concern pathogenic species be base on heterologous study in the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG this study indicate that the antagonistically act repressor SmtB and Zur regulate zinc homeostasis by use zinc as a cofactor Thereby they regulate bacterial response to change intracellular zinc availability by activate or repress the expression of importer or exporter gene During starvation apoZur be release from the DNA allow zinc import by derepression of zinc importer gene such as MTB znuABC and yciC Similar activity of Zur be observe in the ruminant pathogen Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis MAP HoloSmtB detach from the DNA when zinc be in excess thereby allow gene transcription of zinc exporter such as ZitA of MTB Zincdependent regulation of smtB expression have be demonstrate for MTB and MAP In this species SmtB have be show to be cotranscribed with Zur from a operon here refer to as smtBzur which seem to be autoregulated by SmtB Cotranscription and autoregulation have also be propose for MSMEG suggest a general regulation concept of the operon in mycobacterium Little be know about the influence of zinc on gene expression in mycobacterium The regulons of MTB Zur and the zinc starvation regulon of MAP have be identify this study reveal a Zurdependent and zinc starvationdependent induction of a set of gene which encode alternative ribosomal protein ARPs ARPs in contrast to their zinccontaining paralogues do not use zinc as a structural component In addition the virulenceassociated mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX the zinc importer znuABC and CobWlike chaperone be all induce upon Zur deletion or zinc starvation However direct involvement of Zur in regulation be base on bind site prediction only and be not experimentally confirm Knowledge of the role of SmtB in zinc homeostasis in mycobacterium be limit to prediction of its bind site in MTB and study of its promoter in MSMEG In nonpathogenic mycobacterium eg MSMEG very few study have be publish on zinc homeostasis this include the presence of a zitA homologue the zincdependent DNA repair protein KU which be important for zinc resistance and the involvement of mycobacterial protein Y MPY in the hibernation of alternative ribosome In the present study we apply a comprehensive transcriptional approach to investigate the smtBzur operon of mycobacterium in the context of MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as good as the regulons of SmtB and Zur Our result provide novel insight into zincdependent gene regulation in MSMEG and reveal additional putative zinc transport system Moreover we demonstrate the relevance of SmtB and Zur during zinc stress and starvation and characterize detail of their own regulation The result indicate that the regulation of zinc homeostasis in MSMEG be much complex than that in pathogenic mycobacterium Overall we provide novel finding which contribute to our understand of mycobacterial response to change zinc concentrationsRESULTS The smtBzur operon structure be conserve in mycobacterium Regulation of zinc homeostasis in mycobacterium be achieve by the antagonistic activity of the regulator SmtB and Zur this regulator be also present in other bacterial genus but in contrast to mycobacterium they be encode on separate gene which be not organize in a operon Hence we be interest in whether this organization be specific for mycobacterium We perform phylogenetic analysis base on the sequence of smtBzur of MSMEG in NCBI BLASTN and subsequent neighborhood join analysis Of the strain harbor the smtBzur operon be mycobacterial strain They can be group into mainly environmentalnonpathogenic and mainly pathogenic species The remain three strain be genus of the phylum Actinobacteria eg Nocardia species and Saccharothrix species FigÂ Furthermore a operon be also find in Corynebacterium diphtheriae but with significantly low sequence homology Thus the arrangement of smtBzur on a operon as present in mycobacterium be otherwise observe only in a very small group of actinobacteria Operon structure be confirm in select species by extract the genome region homologous to MSMEG zur and smtB and by perform multiple sequence alignment The code sequence homologous to zur and smtB be overlap in MSMEG Mycobacterium thermoresistibile MTB and Saccharothrix espanaensis In Nocardia asteroides the two code sequence be separate by bp see FigÂ S in the supplemental material Zur and SmtB contribute to zinc resistance in MSMEG To get much insight into the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis of MSMEG we determine their regulons For this we use the previously publish regulator mutant MSMEGÎzur and generate the deletion mutant MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur as good as the complement strain MSMEGÎsmtBC MSMEGÎzurC and MSMEGÎsmtBCÎzurC Mutation complementation and polar effect on the adjacent gene MSMEG be control by quantitative realtime PCR qRTPCR FigÂ S As expect smtB expression be abolish in MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur but still present in MSMEGÎzur Vice versa expression of zur be observe in MSMEGÎsmtB but be not detectable in MSMEGÎzur or MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur Interestingly expression of smtB be high in MSMEGÎzur and expression of zur be high in MSMEGÎsmtB than in the wild type suggest that both regulator contribute to their own expression Complementation restore the wildtype phenotype mRNA

MSMEGwt and the complement strain FigÂ have and E The double mutant show significantly reduce growth at high concentration or âmM FigÂ F Hence all mutant be affect in growth much likely by impair

putatively involve in zinc transport MSMEG and a proline dehydrogenase MSMEG However the much prominently affect gene of the zinc stress transcriptome be MSMEG which be strongly induce upon zinc

MspD MSMEG as good as three gene of unknown function MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG and one code for a methyltransferase MSMEG be classify as Zur and zinc dependent The majority of zincindependent gene differentially express in MSMEGÎzur show only weak difference in expression compare to the wild type However we find some interest cluster eg one encode a group of chaperone MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG and one a iron uptake system MSMEG which be much highly express in the mutant whereas gene cluster involve in the EntnerDoudoroff pathway MSMEG ectoine synthesis express at high salt concentration MSMEG and other metabolic pathway MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG show reduce expression compare to the wild type Two gene be highly affect by zur deletion but be zinc independent expression of MSMEG smtB be â¼fold increase and transcription of MSMEG code for a putative LppH protein be strongly repress â¼fold The function of the latter gene be unknown The SmtB regulon be relatively small Overall only gene be differentially express Of this only five belong exclusively to the SmtB regulon FigÂ A TableÂ Five gene be also present in the Zur regulon Two gene be SmtB and zinc dependent MSMEG MSMEG Only the expression of the cobaltzinccadmium resistance gene MSMEG be affect by smtB deletion and TPEN and zinc treatment While its expression be decrease â¼fold upon zinc starvation and induce â¼fold upon zinc excess smtB deletion result in a â¼fold increase of expression In the group of zincindependent gene we find two poorly characterize transcriptional regulator gene MSMEG MSMEG zur MSMEG one gene involve in metabolism MSMEG and a gene encode a protein of the ferritin family MSMEG All this gene be much highly express in the mutant We then compare the Zur and SmtB regulons with the transcriptome of the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant Among differentially express gene in MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur see TableÂ S in the supplemental material with a fold change expression of gene be congruent with gene of the single mutant regulons FigÂ B Hence expression of of the gene regulate by Zur and SmtB of differentially express gene in total be also affect in the double mutant The remain gene can be assign mostly to metabolism and stress response possibly due to the metal imbalance and be regulate by other regulatorsPrediction and distribution of Zur and SmtB bind motif in MSMEG To emphasize the direct involvement of SmtB and Zur in regulation we be next interest in identification of putative bind motif in the regulatory element of regulate gene We screen the MSMEG genome for putative SmtB and Zur bind site by use of the MEME Suite and subsequent FIMO analysis Due to the complex architecture of mycobacterial promoter which can extend up to âkb and the possible presence of much than one functional Zur box upstream of gene we consider motif which be find in the â² untranslated region UTR up to ââbp upstream of predict open read frame ORFs as putative bind site Of motif for Zur be find in the choose â² UTR of ORFs TableÂ Among that we find motif locate in the promoteroperator region of Zurregulated gene TableÂ indicate by boldface and TablesÂ and indicate by asterisk ie the predict ZnuABC transporter MSMEG and a 2 ABC transporter MSMEG four CobWlike protein MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG a methyltransferase MSMEG and the set of gene encode ARPs MSMEG MSMEG Some promoteroperators harbor much than one predict motif MSMEG MSMEG MSMEG which suggest a complex regulation of this gene as already describe for Streptomyces coelicolor and Cupriavidus metallidurans Notably smtBzur be also precede by a putative Zur bind site SmtB motif prediction by the MEME Suite base on the promoter sequence of the gene of the MSMEG SmtB regulon be not successful due to the low numb of gene Therefore we use in our FIMO analysis the putative SmtB bind site of MTB which be previously predict from in vitro bind assay with smtBzur promoter fragment However we be unable to confirm the presence of a SmtB bind site upstream of smtBzur of MSMEG zitA be regulate by SmtB FIMO analysis of the MSMEG genome do not predict any conclusive SmtB bind site neither for smtBzur nor for any other SmtBregulated gene even though smtBzur transcription repression by SmtB have be previously propose for MTB and MSMEG To dissect the relevance of SmtB in the regulation of gene in MSMEG we analyze MSMEG the zitA homologue of MSMEG whose expression be strongly induce in the MSMEGÎsmtB mutant and which show significant homology to other CDF transporter Since MSMEG have also be propose as a gene homologue of zitA we first analyze expression of both gene upon zinc stress We observe a concentrationdependent induction of MSMEG but not of MSMEG FigÂ A confirm the relevance of MSMEG in zinc homeostasis In a next step we fuse the promoter of MSMEG FigÂ B to lacZ use the expression vector pJEM and analyze promoter activity by a Î²galactosidase assay in MSMEGwt and MSMEGÎsmtB under standard condition and upon zinc starvation TPEN or zinc excess ZnSO this analysis reveal that promoter activity be significantly induce upon zinc stress in MSMEGwt and constantly high under all condition in MSMEGÎsmtB FigÂ C To analyze a direct involvement of SmtB in MSMEG regulation we perform chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP experiment MSMEGÎsmtB be complement with Flagtagged SmtB and DNAprotein complex be precipitate after crosslinking with a antibody target the Flag tag or a isogenic IgG control antibody DNA from ChIP be quantify by qRTPCR with primer target the MSMEG promoter and additionally with primer target the promoter of smtBzur which be include as a SmtB but zinc independently regulate gene as good as intragenic control primer locate in MSMEG and in the zur gene As show in FigÂ have ChIP lead to the significant enrichment of MSMEG promoter DNA but not however of the smtBzur promoter or the intragenic control when grow under standard condition This indicate that SmtB bind to the MSMEG promoter despite the absence of a SmtB bind motif similar to MTB but suggest the presence of a different SmtB bind site which have to be identify in future experiment Regulation of smtBzur expression be dependent on both regulator Transcriptional analysis of the smtB and zur deletion mutant suggest that both SmtB and Zur regulate their own expression since deletion of one regulator affect the expression of the other This regulation be independent of zinc table and FigÂ S The datum show above however suggest that SmtB play a inferior role in regulation as no bind of SmtB to the promoter be visible under standard condition FigÂ have this finding be in contrast to that in other mycobacterium as smtB expression be zinc dependent in MAP and regulate by SmtB in MTB Therefore we study the relevance of Zur and SmtB on MSMEG smtBzur regulation in much detail First we analyze promoter activity of the smtBzur promoter after transformation of MSMEGwt MSMEGÎzur MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur with pJEMsmtB FigÂ A As show in FigÂ B promoter activity be significantly enhance in all mutant compare to that in the wild type Upon TPEN or ZnSO treatment no change in promoter activity be observe in the wild type or in the double mutant In contrast in MSMEGÎzur zinc depletion result in reduce promoter activity and zinc excess result in high promoter activity In MSMEGÎsmtB promoter activity be low upon ZnSO treatment and increase upon addition of TPEN This indicate that in MSMEGÎzur the remain regulator SmtB bind to the promoter when zinc be absent whereas in MSMEGÎsmtB Zur bind to the promoter when zinc be present FigÂ Remarkably zincdependent regulation be detectable only in the absence of the other regulator Unlike with MTB a Zur bind site but no comprehensive SmtB bind motif can be identify by FIMO analysis in the smtB promoter of MSMEG Thus we perform ChIP analysis to elucidate the zincdependent direct bind of both regulator to their respective promoter use MSMEGÎsmtB express Flagtagged SmtB and MSMEGÎzur complement with hemagglutinin HAtagged Zur As show in FigÂ C the amount of DNA of the smtB promoter be significantly enrich after Zur ChIP antiHA whereas no enrichment be observe after SmtB ChIP antiFlag and in the intragenic zur control FigÂ have demonstrate direct bind of Zur to the promoter region of smtBzur under standard growth condition Exposure of the bacterium to change zinc concentration influence promoter bind of the regulator Zur bind be significantly reduce upon zinc starvation TPEN but increase upon addition of zinc indicate by the depletion or enrichment of DNA of the smtBzur promoter region respectively FigÂ C Enrichment of promoter DNA after SmtB ChIP be visible only when zinc be deplete by TPEN FigÂ have this datum clearly show that in MSMEG Zur and SmtB replace each other to regulate their own expression in response to zinc availability FigÂ DISCUSSION Despite the importance of zinc in mycobacterial metabolism only a few study have be publish on mycobacterial zinc homeostasis The importance of zinc be deduce mostly from study focus on mycobacterial pathogen All information concern the transcriptional regulation of zinc homeostasis regulator SmtB and Zur have be obtain in MSMEG by heterologous expression of the MTB smtB and MSMEG smtB promoter Our transcriptomic analysis of the MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as good as the transcriptome of MSMEGÎsmtB and MSMEGÎzur mutant reveal a complete and complex picture of zincdependent gene regulation in MSMEG much gene in MSMEG affect by zinc encode already know or putative zinc transport system as good as chaperone and alternative ribosomal protein ARPs The know and common importer znuABC MSMEG be induce upon zinc starvation and Zur deletion in MSMEG This find be comparable to Zurcontrolled homologous znuABC in MTB and MAP transporter MAPc Similar to other bacterium MSMEG regulate expression of CobWlike protein upon zinc starvation Homologous gene in MAP and MTB have be show to be regulate zinc dependently by Zur In Cupriavidus metallidurans CobW protein substitute for miss zinc importer During zinc starvation expression of gene rpmB rpmG rpsN rpsR and rpmE encode ARPs be highly induce and regulate by Zur ARPs do not need zinc as a structural component and support MSMEG survival upon zinc limitation high expression of such gene under limit zinc condition have also be describe for MTB MAP Bacillus subtilis Streptomyces coelicolor and other bacterium concern zinc export in MSMEG our result reveal that expression of the zinc exporter MSMEG ZitA encode by MSMEG be directly regulate by SmtB which be in accordance with finding on MTB ZitA Thus MSMEG seem to possess zinc storage and transport mechanism similar to that of pathogenic mycobacterium However in contrast to pathogenic mycobacterium the MSMEG zinc regulon comprise additional putative zinc uptake system such as the predict Zn uptake transporter encode by MSMEG or mspD MSMEG The Mycobacterium smegmatis porins Msp represent a group of four highly similar protein MspA to have specific for mycobacterium MspA be involve in the uptake of glucose phosphate amino acid and iron and MspC be involve in copper uptake and growth MspD differ from the other Msps in amino acid only but no substrate specificity have be describe so far Our study indicate that MspD may play a role in zinc uptake and may presumably provide a additional rapid channelbased exchange system for nutrient Remarkably MSMEG which be part of the MSMEG operon show no homology to gene of pathogenic mycobacterium but to MVAN of the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii This gene be predict to be part of a 2 Zurregulated znuABC transporter Due to the observe high expression in MSMEG treat with TPEN and in MSMEGÎzur the transporter operon MSMEG may therefore encode a additional zinc importer in MSMEG With regard to mycobacterial phylogeny the absence of this transport system in pathogenic mycobacterium suggest a good zinc availability in the host In the concept of phylogenetic adaptation of pathogen to their host this may have lead to the loss of additional uptake system Our analysis unravel the transcriptional regulation of the MSMEG smtBzur operon The result indicate that in MSMEG as with zinc import regulation of zinc homeostasis also seem to be much complex than in pathogenic mycobacterium SmtB and Zur be both sensitive measure of zinc concentration in other bacterium Expression of the operon be autoregulated by SmtB in MTB andor be zinc dependent as show for MAP Here we find that in MSMEGwt expression of smtB and zur be unaffected when zinc be either absent or in excess table and see FigÂ S in the supplemental material This find be in accordance with that in S coelicolor in which the amount of Zur protein under high or low zinc condition remain constant Strikingly the apparently constitutive expression of smtBzur in MSMEG be maintain by SmtB and Zur depend on the availability of zinc We find that both regulator affect the expression of their operon Our promoter study with the regulator deletion mutant reveal that both SmtB and Zur be need for full regulatory control of their operon promoter Furthermore we show that the regulation of smtBzur expression be hierarchic Zur seem to dominate the control and repress expression of the operon when zinc be freely available for the bacterium FigÂ B We far show antagonistic bind of one regulator to the operator in the absence of the other FigÂ C and have Hence even in the case of imbalance in zinc homeostasis expression of the operon be never uncontrolled The importance of control smtBzur expression be also indicate by our zone of inhibition ZoI assay Fig have to F They show that differential gene expression in MSMEG lack Zur or SmtB result in reduce zinc tolerance which be not observable when both regulator be absent in the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant Thus the regulons of Zur and SmtB be necessary for maintain MSMEG zinc homeostasis If uncontrolled differential gene expression alone cannot cope with zinc imbalance which be illustrate by the reduce zinc tolerance of the MSMEGÎsmtBÎzur double mutant when expose to high zinc concentration in the ZoI assay However the quality of zinc imbalance in the MSMEG single mutant need to be clarify in future experiment The antagonistic influence of Zur and SmtB on smtBzur expression have not yet be report for other bacterium On first glance such a autoregulation seem to be peculiar However a close look reveal that it be necessary for a sensitive control of zinc homeostasis In the case of sole regulation by Zur the operon would be derepressed upon zinc limitation This may lead to excessive synthesis of apoZur and may delay or impair the shutdown of zinc importer when zinc be sufficiently available Moreover additional SmtB produce simultaneously would impair its own deactivation and block zinc export to avoid zinc excess On the other hand sole regulation by SmtB would allow operon expression exclusively when MSMEG encounter a excess of zinc or it would depend on the halflife of SmtB since SmtB bind to the DNA in its apo form FigÂ have and A This mechanism may be likely in organism with stable zinc homeostasis However due to limit apoZur production this mechanism would be disadvantageous for control zinc import after starvation Therefore the good capability to react quickly to change zinc concentration may also explain why Zur be the dominate regulator in this complex regulatory mechanism The dominance of Zur also make sense as the environmental bioavailability of zinc be presumably low Accordingly in liquid culture growth of MSMEG be hamper only in the absence of zur FigÂ B which may be explain by a uncontrolled zinc influx due to the lack of counterregulation This however need to be prove by additional study in the future In pathogenic MTB smtBzur regulation seem to be solely affect by SmtB This suggest that mycobacterium in the host be expose to much constant or high zinc concentration than they be in the environment which would make regulation by SmtB much plausible and may reflect another example of mycobacterial adaptation to the host Overall in the present study we provide novel insight into the response of MSMEG to change zinc concentration We show that MSMEG be good adapt to environmental change in zinc availability This be achieve by a sensitive regulation of the smtBzur operon by both Zur and SmtB allow a balance expression of the two regulator even under change zinc concentration and by the presence of additional putative zinc transporter in the genome this mechanism enable MSMEG to maintain reactivity and to constantly control intracellular zinc homeostasisMATERIALS AND method Bacterial strain chemical and growth condition Escherichia coli be grow in LuriaBertani LB broth or LB agar

in The Gambia call for continue antibiotic susceptibility monitor The rich variety of rdxA mutation that we find will be useful in far structurefunction study of RdxA the enzyme responsible for Mtz susceptibility in this important pathogen INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylorus chronically infect much people in develop country typically start in infancy â and last for life It also remain a significant pathogen in industrialize country infect some to of adult in many society Chronic H pylorus infection be a major cause of gastric stomach and duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer â It also increase the risk of infection by other gastrointestinal pathogen iron deficiency anemia and infant malnutrition and growth falter especially among the very poor this latter condition be of particular concern in The Gambia a small develop country on the West Coast of Africa Fortunately many H pyloriassociated illness can be prevent or cure by the timely eradication of the bacterium which typically entail a to week of treatment variously with metronidazole Mtz amoxicillin Amo and clarithromycin Cla when affordable andor tetracycline Tet in combination with a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole andor bismuth where allow by local regulation H pylorus transmission tend to be highly localize and preferentially intrafamilial in industrialize society and often also between household in the local community in develop country setting give the relatively localize transmission successful eradication from many member of a household or community may markedly diminish the risk of new infection especially of newborn and thereby contribute importantly to public health Resistance to useful antimicrobial especially Mtz and Cla have be a major problem in some society even among people not previously treat for their H pylorus infection Such resistance be generally attributable to inadvertent H pylorus exposure during treatment for other condition Mtz itself be a innocuous prodrug that be activate by chemical reduction to hydroxylamine type compound which be bactericidal to H pylorus In the strain study to date mostly from industrialize society a modest level of Mtz resistance eg to or Î¼g of Mtzml be usually associate with inactivation of the gene rdxA which encode a nonessential oxygeninsensitive NAPDH nitroreductase that chemically reduce Mtz in vitro Higherlevel resistance in rdxA mutant strain eg to Î¼g of Mtzml result from the inactivation of frxA a relate but generally little strongly transcribe nitroreductase gene however higherlevel resistance can result from mutation in any of several additional gene that likely also affect intracellular redox potential â The hydroxylaminetype derivative of Mtz that RdxA protein generate be mutagenic such that exposure to sublethal Mtz concentration induce as good as select for mutation to Mtz resistance No commonly use antiH pylorus drug other than Mtz be know to require activation to render them bactericidal nor to be so highly mutagenic In addition the several resistance to this other drug identify to date involve specific mutational change that alter the target function In particular resistance to the relate macrolide erythromycin Ery and clarithromycin Cla which be use in antiH pylorus therapy be usually achieve by point mutation at either of two adjacent site in S rRNA that diminish macrolide bind to the ribosome Cla resistance seem to be rare in many society but common much than onefourth of strain in other The observe prevalence probably reflect a combination of the very few rRNA site in which sequence change can confer resistance and be not too deleterious for the bacterium a need to incorporate any resistance mutation in both S rRNA gene to achieve a resistance phenotype and the intensity of macrolide use for other infection and thereby inadvertent exposure of resident H pylorus strain Tet resistance be much rare than Mtz or Cla resistance although several bona fide resistant strain have be identify and analyze In the bestdescribed case modest resistance result from three contiguous change in the Tet bind pocket in S rRNA position to Lowerlevel resistance be achieve by mutation at one or two of this position andor by mutation in gene in other chromosomal location that have not yet be identify but be suspect to affect bacterial permeability or efflux Amo resistance be also very rare but where it be find it have be ascribe to mutation in a penicillinbinding protein involve in cell wall metabolism â The present study of drug susceptibility and resistance in Gambian H pylorus strain be motivate in part by consider that H pylorus be a genetically very diverse species with different genotype predominate in different wellseparated geographic region even in different part of Africa and that much study of drug susceptibility and resistance have focus on strain from Europe the Americas or Asia As with many infectionrelated topic there have be far few critical study of antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility of H pylorus strain from Africa especially that from West Africaâthe ancestral home of much

Mtzml Fig In far test of strain that do not grow with Î¼g of Mtzml of the representative strain from infant to month old and of representative strain from adult grow on medium with only Î¼g of Mtzml rdxA nitroreductase gene analysis A transformation test be use to determine whether Mtzs strain be distinct metabolically from much susceptible reference strain in require much than just rdxA inactivation to achieve Mtz resistance â Eleven Mtzs strain be transform with genomic DNA from a derivative of strain whose rdxA gene have be replace with a chloramphenicolresistant Camr cassette ÎrdxAcat Each of the to Camr transformant colony test from each of the strain transformation grow good on agar with Î¼g of Mtzml This outcome indicate that much or all Mtzs Gambian H pylorus strain be just one mutational rdxA inactivation step away from become resistant In a converse experiment we test whether mutation in rdxA be important for the resistance of Mtzr Gambian strain This entail transform representative Mtzr strain with genomic DNA from a H pylorus strain contain a kanamycinresistant Kanr cassette insert next to a functional rdxA gene We expect that a fraction of Kanr transformants would acquire the donor strain rdxA functional allele even though much may retain the recipient rdxA mutant allele because H pylorus transformation tend to involve mostly short DNA fragment At less of the to Kanr transformants score from each of Mtzr recipient strain be find to be Mtzs on agar with Î¼g of Mtzml even though much Kanr transformants remain Mtzr We infer that this few Kanr Mtzs transformants have gain the donor functional rdxA allele and thereby conclude that rdxA inactivation be need for much or all Mtzs Gambian H pylorus strain if they be to become MtzrSequence comparison of rdxA from Mtzr and Mtzs strain The rdxA gene be PCR amplify and sequence from Mtzr MIC range to Î¼gml and Mtzs Gambian strain MIC Î¼gml The average rdxA sequence diversity

strain O Secka unpublished datum Of the Mtzr strain characterize contain nonsense translation stop codon within the rdxA orf include of the resistant to Î¼g of Mtzml in contrast only of the isolate with lowerlevel resistance to Î¼gml contain nonsense mutation in rdxA P Table This difference in distribution be in accord with nonsense mutation cause protein truncation and thus a complete loss of RdxA function Some missense mutation diminish but do not entirely eliminate a encode protein activity and thus would confer only leaky phenotype lowerlevel Mtz resistance in the case of rdxA whereas many other would be good tolerate and have little if any effect on activity of the encode protein Three of Mtzr strain have insertion of one or two nucleotide and thereby rdxA frameshift mutation which would result in new amino acid sequence distal to the mutant site and thereby loss of rdxA function In addition two strain contain inframe deletion of and nucleotide which do not cause change in RdxA protein sequence distal to the mutant site Thirteen of Mtzr strain have neither translation stop nor indel mutation in rdxA but their rdxA allele differ from that in Mtzs strain by numerous substitution Consideration of translation product in term of H pylorus RdxA protein recently report tridimensional structure PDB ID QDL identify nine substitution find only in Mtzr strain SL PL and GD each in two strain and AI AT CY SR GC and AT each in one strain that be likely to have decrease RdxA function due to effect on stability dimerization and FMN bind and also indicate that the many other difference may not interfere with this good understand of RdxA protein functional property One substitution find in Mtzr strain RH that should decrease FMN bind affinity be also find in a Mtzs strain The basis of Mtz resistance in two strain R and R MIC Î¼gml be not clear from RdxA structure consideration Their residue RdxA protein differ at many position from the RdxA protein whose structure be determine Hp of reference strain However all of the difference present in strain R DN RK g RK VI AV QK and VI and much QH DN RK g RK EK g VI EQ AV EK QK and VI in R be also present in many other resistant and susceptible strain and thus may not perturb function We interpret that much of this difference simply reflect neutral mutation in accord with H pyloris great genetic diversity None of the three mutation that be specific to R EK g and EK be expect to affect RdxA function because they appear on the protein surface far from the FMN bind site Thus why strain R and R be resistant be not obvious possibly their particular combination of change in RdxA diminish function confer resistance or this strain may have polar mutation in the upstream DNA that we do not sequence Among the rdxA sequence from Mtzs strain have internal stop codon Table and other have point mutation that also may lead to rdxA inactivation RH in one strain because it should decrease RdxA affinity for FMNâ²s negative charge phosphate and AV in two strain because it entail replacement of small alanine by bulky valine in the protein core although direct test be need to learn how severely this replacement affect protein stability and function If this mutation do indeed cause rdxA inactivation the Mtzs phenotype may stem from highlevel frxA expression the possibility of nonsense suppressor mutant tRNAs in certain strain also merit consideration The nonsense mutation between Mtzs and Mtzr strain to Î¼g of Mtzml be significant P Table however overall the nonsense mutation between Mtzs and Mtzr strain be not P Table Fifteen substitution be find only in Mtzr isolate HR SL PL AI AT CY HT EK SR GD g GC EK DA and AT which suggest that some of them may decrease RdxA function Conversely five be only find in Mtzs isolate SG TA AV AV and QR and thus may be neutral of this five only AV be suspect of decrease RdxA function as note aboveSusceptibility of Gambian strain to other antibiotic All of our Gambian H pylorus culture grow directly from gastric biopsy specimen be find to be highly sensitive to the closely relate macrolide Cla and Ery All culture be also Tets and Amos Table although one and four of them contain rare Amor and Tetr cell able to grow on medium with Î¼g of Amo or Tetml respectively frequency of â to â far test of one Tetr colony from each of this unusual Tetr subclonecontaining culture show that their MICs range from to Î¼g of Tetml and that each be indistinguishable by RAPDDNA fingerprint from the predominant Tets strain from the same biopsy specimen datum not show this four set of strain be not closely relate to one another as expect since they come from different person We find that the PCRamplified S rRNA gene of each Tetr strain be identical in sequence to that of its Tets sibling from the same biopsy specimen We conclude that in each of this four case Tet resistance be due to mutation in a gene distinct from that for S rRNA DISCUSSION H pylorus infection contribute importantly to several human disease in both develop and industrialize country and directly impact on health care system worldwide Its public health impact be of particular concern in develop country because the prevalence of infection be so very high Here we score susceptibility and resistance to clinically relevant antiH pylorus agent use a test of efficiency of colony formation by single cell This test be especially useful for score susceptibility to Mtz because Mtz can be both mutagenic and bactericidal it both induce and select for resistance mutation We find that much than twothirds of Gambian H pylorus strain be Mtzr This high prevalence can be explain by the relative low cost and easy availability of Mtz in The Gambia as be typical of develop country worldwide Our result be in accord with other report of many Mtzr strain elsewhere in Africa Senegal Nigeria South Africa Cameroon and Egypt â India and Latin America Typically somewhat little than half of H pylorus strain from Europe and North America have be find to be Mtzr likely reflect the tight control of Mtz usage in industrialize than in develop country Our observation that all six strain from infant to month of age be sensitive to Î¼g of Mtzml in contrast to of that from old people â¥ year P also merit far examination especially in light of the possibility that rdxA function may contribute to fitness during the establishment of infection Prior study with other set of strain have show that Mtz resistance typically involve inactivation of rdxA which encode a nitroreductase that convert Mtz from prodrug to bactericidal agent by chemical reduction However H pylorus strain also contain a relate gene frxA which also confer Mtz susceptibility if highly express independent of rdxA status Our DNA transformation study indicate that each of Mtzs Gambian strain test require only rdxA inactivation to gain a Mtzr phenotype and conversely that resistance involve rdxA inactivation in each of the Mtzr strain test Sequence analysis of rdxA gene from our strain identify lossoffunction mutation that should cause Mtz resistance similar to that find in previous study In particular rdxA nonsense stop codon mutation be much common in strain with moderate level resistance Î¼gml than in strain with lowerlevel resistance to Î¼gml in agreement with other finding However of Mtzs strain have rdxAnull nonsense mutation and other have point mutation that also possibly may result in inactive RdxA protein this observation be consistent with other report that rdxA inactivation need not always lead to Mtz resistance and can be explain by postulate higherlevel expression of the relate frxA nitroreductase gene We also find that much Mtzr strain have mutation scatter across the rdxA gene that be not likely to contribute to their resistant phenotype This be in accord with H pyloris wellknown great sequence diversity see here in the rdxA gene Increasingly frequent Cla resistance up to onefourth or much of H pylorus strain have be report in Europe and North America High prevalence where encounter have be attribute to use of macrolide to treat respiratory infection â In The Gambia Ery be now routinely use to treat low respiratory tract and skin infection However we find no resistance to Cla or Ery in the H pylorus isolate we test Tet and Amo be also much use Tet especially be inexpensive and readily available in local drug store in The Gambia often without prescription However its easy availability do not result in much resistance in Gambian H pylorus strain Tetr strain be recover from pool culture from only four patient and then only as very rare cell in the population This outcome be in accord with the rarity of Tet resistance in H pylorus from other part of the world None of our four Tetr strain have mutational change in the several allow position in the S rRNA Tet bind pocket that can result in modest Tet resistance Thus by default their resistance be likely to stem from mutation in other lociâa class of mutation previously interpret as much easily achieve but also likely to diminish H pylorus fitness We propose that the low probability of mutation at just a few specific rRNA site and the low fitness confer by Tet resistance mutation in other gene explain the rarity of TetrH pylorus despite considerable exposure in The Gambia Resistance to Amo be also very rare in Gambian strain much as have be report for other geographic region Conclusion The increase prevalence of resistance to antibiotic use against H pylorus be of great concern especially in develop country where the cost of even the less expensive first line drug be a burden to average citizen This contribute to the urgency of monitor antibiotic resistant strain frequency to help clinician effectively manage patient and their antibiotic regimen and to effectively deal with treatment failure The rich repertoire of rdxA mutation find in our many Gambian H pylorus strain should be useful for future study of RdxA structure and function of how RdxA and its FrxA homolog make H pylorus susceptible to prodrug such as Mtz and of the role of this two nitroreductase enzyme in H pyloris central metabolic networksACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study be support by fund from the Medical Research Council Unit Fajara The Gambia and

Moss National institute of Health store at âÂ°C in glycerolRESULTS Rationale for sitedirected mutagenesis of CTA subunit gene Figure show a cartoon representation of the predict activesite domain A of the CTA subunit residue that be change be show in red in ballandstick representation and be number Each residue alter be either completely conserve in CT LTI or LTII or be a homolog of a residue that be identify as important for NAD bind base on structural alignment of the CÎ± backbone of CTA or LTA with DT ETA and PT Conservative substitution for Arg Glu and Glu have previously be study in LT but not biochemically in CT holotoxin although RK and EK variant CT holotoxins have be test for mucosal adjuvanticity Tyr substitution for Ser and Val be design to substitute residue find at the correspond position in PT where Tyr residue at the homologous position be predict to be involve in NAD bind possibly contribute to the fold lowerKm value for NAD of PT cite in reference In LT different nonconservative substitution for Ser or Ala be report to prevent assembly SP or to have no effect on toxicity SK or AR H or E although the AR variant be late report to show reduce toxicity homolog of Asp and Arg be also fully conserve and important in PT but substitution at this position have not be study previously in either CT or LT The hydrophobic Ile residue conserve at position in CT and LT Val in LTIIa and LTIIb predict to interact with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD be change to Ala nonconservative or Val conservative The CÎ± backbone trace homolog for Arg in PT be Trp which be also involve in catalysis therefore we convert Arg to Trp or Gly to study the contribution of this residue in CT substitution for Ile and Arg be entirely novel Glu be fully conserve in the CTLT family Although a deletion of this residue in CT have be show to have greatly reduce toxicity and enzymatic activity for unknown reason substitution for Glu have not be study previously His situate in a alpha helix and form part of a loop that block the predict active site be also fully conserve among the heatlabile enterotoxins and be locate similarly to His of PT His be important in the activity of LT and several nonconservative substitution in the loop in LT be report to be little active than that in the wild type wt Here we make novel substitution of Tyr and Ser for His and also delete the entire loop from to in CT Four other insertion mutation be also introduce by addition of twocodon linker at Y and G or fill in of restriction site at T and L not show in Fig this study confirm and significantly extend previous investigation of the structure and function of CTAnalysis of CT variant Initial characterization of each variant holotoxin be perform on crude periplasmic extract prepare from cell grow at Â°C While much mutant strain produce wt level of holotoxin several mutant strain produce little or no detectable holotoxin under this condition RK HY h ÎG w and LLL However when the growth and induction temperature be reduce to or Â°C this mutant strain produce normal amount of holotoxin datum not show and the holotoxin variant produce at or Â°C be as stable as wt CT during subsequent incubation at Â°C as determine by ELISA and SPRIA for immunoreactive holotoxin and Y adrenal cell assay for toxicity Table summarize the comparative datum on holotoxin assembly toxicity and enzymatic activity for select variant CT holotoxins All holotoxins except the VY variant and the conservative substitution variant DE IL and ED not show have reduce toxicity range from EN not show to little than of the toxicity of wt toxin RK RK HY h and EDED For much detail characterization of this variant holotoxins the mutation be move into pARCT by subcloning the bpXbaIClaI fragment encode of thectxA gene from each mutant plasmid and variant holotoxins be purify from liter culture grow at Â°C sample of this variant holotoxin preparation be analyze by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and stain with Coommassie blue datum not show Each recombinant holotoxin produce in E coli be fully stable during assay at Â°C with the CTA protein in a unnicked formStability of variant holotoxins upon treatment with trypsin Each variant holotoxin be test for the ability of its A subunit to be process by mild trypsin treatment into stable CTA and CTA polypeptide Untreated or trypsintreated sample be reduce denature and analyze by SDSPAGE and Western blot Fig much variant be as stable upon trypsin treatment as the wt and generate the expect CTA polypeptide in comparable amount Generally the stability upon trypsinization correlate good with the temperature sensitivity of assembly report in Table The HY variant be highly sensitive to trypsin and be almost completely degrade The RK h and RK variant holotoxins also show increase sensitivity to trypsin degradation to decrease degree as show in Fig analysis by GMSPRIA show that recombinant wt CT treat with trypsin retain its reactivity with antiCTA antibody and the toxin concentration in the trypsintreated and untreated sample as determine by the slope of the curve be identical Fig A The increase in signal at saturation see after trypsinization probably reflect slightly great reactivity of the polyclonal antibody with native nick toxin the antigen use for immunization Reduction of a duplicate sample of the trypsintreated wt toxin with dithiothreitol prior to analysis by GMSPRIA lead to almost complete loss of the signal Fig A presumably reflect dissociation of the A polypeptide from the immobilize AB complex and show that the trypsintreated wt sample be in a fully nick yet stable state In contrast the recombinant RK variant holotoxin lose much than of the signal after brief treatment with trypsin alone Fig B without reduction suggest that the RK substitution cause a alter conformation of the A subunit expose one or much trypsinsensitive site The RK variant holotoxin exhibit a intermediate phenotype where the immunogenicity of a portion of the sample be stable upon trypsin treatment but approximately of the molecule be degrade FigC as determine from the plateau signal free CTB compete for GM bind and reduce the maximum signal and the slope of the curve a direct measurement of the concentration of holotoxin This suggest a slight fold defect in the RK variant cause some of the molecule to adopt a wt conformation and the rest to adopt a alternative conformation with expose trypsinsensitive site The h variant when assay by reduce SDSPAGE in a timelimited trypsin treatment format be nick by trypsin at the same initial rate as wt CT but far incubation lead to almost complete degradation Fig DDifferences in immunoreactivity of representative variant holotoxins alter reactivity with MAbs like difference in susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage can often reveal subtle difference in conformation of protein Among our collection of MAbs that react with conformational epitope of CT be several that react only with holotoxin by SPRIA some that react good with holotoxin by GMSPRIA but poorly with free denature CTA by Western blot and conversely some that react poorly with holotoxin but good with free CTA When we analyze the temperature or trypsinsensitive variant holotoxins we consistently find that they have alter pattern of reactivity towards this different class of MAbs Fig and Table Whereas the RK variant have a slight assembly defect as determine by trypsin sensitivity it behave like wt CT in its reactivity with this MAbs react good with C and G weakly with have and poorly with G and C Fig A versus B In contrast the RK variant have a completely different profile retain reactivity with C while lose reactivity to G and react much much strongly with the MAbs that normally give a poor signal with native CT Fig C datum for other variant be present in Table represent the maximum signal obtain for each MAb Î¼l of hybridoma supernatant per good Deletion of the entire loop fill the active site ÎG variant cause almost complete loss of reactivity with group and MAbs that react with holotoxin suggest that this loop determine or be essential for the epitope detect by this MAbs Each variant holotoxin that show decrease reactivity with group and MAbs also gain reactivity with group B MAbs that normally react only with denature CTA bind to plastic or nitrocellulose suggest a conformational change result in exposure of a epitope of CTA that be normally hide in wt holotoxin Enzymatic activity of variant holotoxins Holotoxin variant that be able to be nick by trypsin be test for ADPribosyltransferase activity CT ADPribosylates DEABAG in a NADdependent manner that be absolutely dependent upon reduction and be greatly increase by both nick and addition of ARF and GTP Basal level of activity for trypsinactivated variant without addition of ARF or GTP be show in Table as percentage of wt activity We be unable to detect any enzymatic activity for the RK h or EDED variant holotoxins Generally the level of enzyme activity correlate good with Y toxicity datum exception include substitution for R E and E that have notably little enzymatic activity than toxicity and conversely the EH and YWAH substitution that have significantly much enzymatic activity than toxicityKinetic study of enzyme activity of holotoxin variant DEABAG assay be do with various NAD concentration to obtain apparent Km andVmax value for select holotoxin variant from LineweaverBurk plot of Vagainst NAD In independent experiment with wt CT we obtain apparent km to mM Table that be similar to that from other report in the literature to mM depend on the acceptor substrate The EH variant show a slight increase in Km for NAD in the absence of ARF Other variant have too little activity to give reliable datum under this condition With the addition of rARF and GTP the Km for NAD with wt CT decrease significantly and theVmax increase Table as have be report previously Significant increase inKm for NAD compare to wt CT be observe for the RK and IA variant while all other variant test hadKms for NAD that remain close to that of the wt yet have reduce Vmax value as expect for variant with reduce enzymatic activity DISCUSSION By concentrate on residue that be highly conserve in the A subunit of the CTLT family of enterotoxins we identify several novel residue of CTA that be critical to the structure and function of CT holotoxin Novel substitution or insertion mutant for E Y E or E differentially affect toxicity and enzymatic activity in vitro without detectably affect holotoxin structure while the effect of other substitution mutant can be account for at less in part by previously undocumented alteration in holotoxin structure Many of this substitution be locate in or adjacent to the propose activesite NADbinding cleave and can reasonably be assume to exert their effect directly on NAD bind RK RK IA or catalytic activity h ED ED Analysis of the threedimensional structure of member of the CTLT family predict that the residue equivalent to Glu in CT correspond to the single activesite glutamate of PT Glu DT Glu and ETA Glu In study with a isolate LTA subunit however both Glu and Glu be require for full enzymatic activity since individual aspartate substitution at this position reduce activity and fold respectively We see very similar result on toxicity with the individual aspartatesubstituted mutant CT holotoxins but see much great effect on enzymatic activity Only when both glutamate be replace with aspartate do we see complete loss of toxicity and enzymatic activity Clearly the member of the CTLT family of ADPribosylating toxin differ significantly from the other ADPribosylating toxin in the detail of their catalytic activity In crystallographic study the RK variant of LT differ significantly in structure from wt LT and be much sensitive to proteolysis Our biochemical and immunological datum show similar change in the RK mutant of CT support a role for RK both in maintain holotoxin structure and in NAD bind The novel RK variant be significantly much stable than the RK variant yet it show a similar reduction in toxicity as good as a increase apparent Km for NAD The conservative RK substitution have a much great effect on toxin activity of wt than do a nonconservative substitution of the correspond residue in PT RL which show of wt toxicity emphasize the difference in functional importance of conserve residue between this toxin At the equivalent of position in CT PT and the LTIIb toxin have Val whereas CT LTI and LTIIa have Ile replace Ile with Ala in CT reduce activity to fold compare to that of the wt and significantly increase the Km for NAD while the conservative Leu substitution have no effect provide the first direct evidence for the importance of a highly hydrophobic residue at this position for NAD bind this datum provide novel direct experimental support for the structurebased hypothesis of van den Akker et al that Ile in LT and by inference in CT be involve in a hydrophobic interaction with the adenine ring of NAD We also change the amino acid at position and in CT to residue find at homologous position in PT that be propose to participate in NAD bind to test the hypothesis that the poor affinity of CT for NAD Km of several millimolars can be improve by modify its predict NADbinding site to resemble much closely that of PT which have a severalmicromolar Km for NAD In both CT and LTI Arg have hydrophobic interaction with residue that be propose to influence the movement of the activesiteoccluding loop to The RW variant which may maintain some of this hydrophobic interaction with His retain significantly great enzymatic activity and toxicity than the RG variant although both be little active than the wt The single substitution SY and VY decrease the toxicity and enzymatic activity of the variant holotoxins slightly to moderately but together they produce and fold reduction respectively The SY variant in the presence of recombinant ARF show a slight increase in the apparentKm for NAD and a fold reduction in the apparent Vmax compare to that of the wt this substitution at position and in CT therefore generally have adverse effect on enzymatic activity andor toxicity but not on the structure of the CT variant and their phenotype do not suggest that they have significantly increase affinity for NAD Other investigator show that CTA variant with substitution in the conserve Î² strand YVSTS residue to of the putative NADbinding site also affect the structure of the variant CTA polypeptide and markedly decrease their enzymatic activity but they do not study the effect of this substitution in variant holotoxins datum from our laboratory and other support the critical role play by the activesiteoccluding loop in the activity of the heatlabile enterotoxins substitution for His in CT decrease the stability of variant holotoxins and abolish enzyme activity in a manner similar to that report for the HA variant of LT The proposal of Kato et al that His interact directly with the catalytic residue Glu be unlikely give the distance between His and Glu in the crystal structure of both LT and CT Instead His may act indirectly to activate a water nucleophile that interact with Glu as propose by rise and Schramm In LT substitution within the activesiteoccluding loop of residue that be find in the relate LTII toxin also affect structure and function The fact that normally cryptic epitope recognize by our group B MAbs be expose in the His holotoxin variant in the Î deletion variant and in all temperaturesensitive holotoxin variant with significantly reduce activity RK LLL suggest a common structural or fold defect in this variant We see a slight effect on enzymatic activity and toxicity with a single residue insertion on the external surface of this loop in CT TTH In a recent study we independently identify a HY variant that affect the interaction of CTA with ARF in a bacterial twohybrid system All other substitution in the present study with detectable enzymatic activity be stimulate by ARF suggest that ARF do not interact directly with the catalytically important residue Surprisingly substitution for Glu and Tyr and the replacement of L by will which be all good remove from the propose active site significantly affect toxicity and enzymatic activity The YWAH and EH variant holotoxins retain high level of enzymatic activity yet have to fold low toxicity respectively suggest a additional role for this residue in vivo possibly for toxin entry traffic or substrate interaction a explanation for the phenotype of the two other variant produce in this study w and LLL be much difficult Both show temperaturesensitive assembly defect Although the w holotoxin form at the permissive temperature and appear nearwt in its reactivity with antiCT MAbs it show only toxicity The LLL variant holotoxin behave like the other structurally alter variant display nonnative MAb epitope and greatly reduce toxicity This residue be good remove from the active site on the âbacksideâ of the A subunit The LLL insertion variant may exert its effect on toxin assembly by affect interaction of the A polypeptide with the A subunit but it be not clear how it dramatically affect the enzymatic and toxic activity of CT In summary we have identify a diverse group of novel holotoxins with variant CTA subunit that have alter biological property which in some case include greatly reduce toxicity The present study significantly extend the available information on the effect of structural change in CTA on the biological and enzymatic activity of CT Several of the CT variant that exhibit differential effect on toxicity and enzyme activity should be useful for future study on the structural basis for interaction of CT with target cell One or much of this variant may prove useful as a immunological adjuvant In this regard our collaborator recently show that the EH variant can act as a effective mucosal adjuvant for immunization against respiratory syncytial virus

TorSTorR twocomponent system when TMAO be available Activation of the tor operon occur upon bind of the phosphorylate response regulator TorR to a single operator site contain the direct repeat nucleotide sequence TTCATANTTCATA Here we show that the replacement of any nucleotide of one TTCATA hexamer prevent TorR bind in vitro mean that TorR specifically interact with this DNA target Identical direct repeat sequence be find in the promoter region of torR and of the new gene torF SO and they allow TorR bind to both promoter Realtime PCR experiment reveal that torR be negative autoregulated whereas torF be strongly induce by TorR in response to TMAO Transcription start site location and footprinting analysis indicate that the operator site at torR overlap the promoter â box whereas the operator site at torF be center at â bp from the start site in agreement with the opposite role of TorR in the regulation of the two gene Since torF and torECAD be positively coregulated by TorR we propose that the TorF protein play a role relate to TMAO respiration Trimethylamine oxide TMAO be a small compound mainly find in aquatic environment In a numb of marine animal include fish and crustacean it stabilize protein against the denature effect of stress such as hydrostatic pressure or high urea or salt concentration This protective role be not yet clearly establish for bacterium but many of them can use TMAO as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration For example Shewanella strain which be gramnegative bacterium with wide respiratory capacity can reduce TMAO efficiently to generate energy during fish spoilage The main TMAO respiratory pathway of Shewanella species comprise a periplasmic terminal reductase TorA contain a molybdenum cofactor and a pentaheme ctype cytochrome TorC anchor to the inner membrane The gene encode the Tor pathway be cluster in the torECAD operon and this operon be regulate by the TorSTorR twocomponent system When TMAO be available in the medium the sensor tor transphosphorylates the response regulator TorR which in turn activate the torECAD operon by bind to a single operator site in the operon promoter A similar Tor respiratory system be present in Escherichia coli and its torCAD structural operon be also control by a TorSTorR signal transduction system The E coli tor sensor detect the presence of not only TMAO but also immature TorC to allow optimal production of the structural component of the Tor respiratory system in induce condition The physiological relevance of this subtle negative autoregulation by apocytochrome TorC be probably that TorC maturation be the limit step of the Tor system biogenesis Overproduction of the ctype cytochrome maturation machinery relieve the negative autoregulation by increase the extent of TorC maturation In addition to the torCAD operon TorRP activate the tnaLAB operon encode the tryptophanase TnaA and a lowaffinity tryptophan permease TnaB The physiological reason for the coregulation of torCAD and tnaLAB be that the tryptophanase activity protect E coli against the alkaline stress generate by the production of alkaline TMA during TMAO respiration Indeed TnaA reverse alkalinization by produce acidic product from ltryptophan In this study we show that TorR of Shewanella oneidensis activate torECAD and a new gene call torF SO and repress its own gene by bind to specific operator site contain a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide sequence TTCATA separate by four nucleotide torF encode a protein that belong to a new family of

repeat of the hexanucleotide sequence TTCATA in the torECAD promoter We have previously show that TorR the TMAO response regulator of S oneidensis induce the torECAD operon by bind to a single operator site locate between position â and â relative to the transcription start site Inspection of this region reveal the presence of a direct repeat of the hexameric sequence TTCATA Fig This tandem direct repeat can be the target of TorR because member of the OmpR family usually interact with direct repeat To test this hypothesis we first change the center of each hexamer italicize independently by a double mutation TTCATAâTTGCTA and carry out a DNAbinding gel shift assay with label DNA fragment correspond to the tor operon region from position â to and purify TorR As show in Fig the DNA fragment contain the double mutation mutation and be not retard by a high concentration Î¼M of TorR whereas the wildtype fragment be This preliminary result be consistent with the idea that each hexamer play a key role in TorR bind To study far the involvement of the TTCATA hexameric sequence in TorR bind we replace each nucleotide of the first hexamer with a guanine residue Fig Strikingly no retardation be observe for any of the six mutate fragment mutation to mean that each nucleotide of the first hexamer be essential for TorR bind To confirm that the two hexamer play a similar role in TorR bind we replace one nucleotide of the 2 hexamer with a guanine residue As expect the mutate DNA fragment mutation be no long retard by TorR In contrast a point mutation TâG in the fournucleotide region space the tandem repeat do not significantly affect TorR bind Fig mutation The same result be obtain when TorR be preincubated with acetyl phosphate datum not show Together this result strongly suggest that the DNA recognition site of TorR comprise at less the sequence TTCATANTTCATA and we propose that like other member of the OmpR family phosphorylate TorR bind as a dimer to its operator site with each monomer interact with one direct repeat bind of TorR to new promoter The fact that we know the specific nucleotide sequence recognize by TorR in the torECAD promoter prompt us to look for homologous nucleotide sequence within the genome of S oneidensis in order to find new potential target of TorR By use the bioMotif utility httpgeneticsmghharvardedudocbioMotif we retrieve sequence homologous to the consensus sequence TTCATANTTCATA locate in noncoding region or in the begin of code region This survey reveal two additional sequence identical to the consensus and locate upstream of the code sequence of torR and of SO hereafter call torF and one sequence upstream of SO contain a single change in one hexamer Fig A Since this sequence can be TorR bind site we check whether the TorR protein be able to bind to them in vitro use a band shift assay we observe DNA retardation for the promoter DNA of torR and torF but not for that of SO Fig B This result show that TorR bind to the torR and torF promoter and it confirm that only one base change in one of the TTCATA repeat sequence prevent TorR bind The same pattern of retardation be observe when TorR be preincubated with mM acetyl phosphate but the TorR affinity for the tear torR and torF promoter DNA be increase two to threefold indicate that phosphorylation of TorR increase its affinity for the DNA target contain the consensus motif datum not show The same pattern search approach be perform by use a fivenucleotide spacer between the two hexamer consensus sequence TTCATANTTCATA Indeed a additional nucleotide in the spacer modify the distance between the nucleotide motif of the hexamer from to bp mean that the same motif be still present on the same side of the DNA helix and thus may still allow TorR bind However no sequence entirely match the consensus be find within the S oneidensis genome and out of the seven sequence contain a single base change in one hexamer none allow TorR bind in vitro datum not show this result support the idea that TorR recognize highly specific sequence present at only a restrict numb of site on the chromosome of S oneidensis To check that TorR bind to the consensus sequence TTCATANTTCATA in the torR and torF promoter we carry out a DNase I footprinting analysis with the DNA fragment use for the retardation experiment As show in Fig C in both case a single region be protect against DNase I digestion when TorR be present The protect region extend over to nucleotide and they cover the entire direct repeat sequence of the torR and torF promoter This find confirm that TorR recognize operator site contain a TTCATA repeat and suggest that it control torR and torF gene expressionNegative autoregulation of the torR gene We try to define the transcription start site of torR by primer extension experiment with RNA prepare from S oneidensis MRR cell grow anaerobically with or without TMAO this experiment be unsuccessful probably because the amount of torR messenger be too low To solve this problem we fuse the putative promoter region of torR to the promoterless lacZ gene of plasmid pGE and we introduce the result multicopy plasmid pPTorRso into a E coli strain LCB from which the entire tor locus be delete to avoid any interference We then carry out primer extension by use RNA prepare from the plasmidcontaining E coli cell and a primer hybridize to the â² end of lacZ Fig B A transcription start site be locate base upstream of the torR start codon To confirm that the transcription start site of torR be identical in E coli and S oneidensis we perform RT PCR by use RNA extract from strain MRR and appropriate convergent oligonucleotide pair Fig When the upstream primer R that hybridize to the â² end of the potential torR messenger be use a PCR product of the expect size be observe but when a upstream primer R complementary to the sequence just upstream of the putative transcription start site be use no DNA fragment be amplify The RT PCR experiment thus show that the position of the torR transcription start site in S oneidensis be identical or close to that define by primer extension in E coli A â promoter box AATAAT close to the E coli â consensus sequence be correctly position relative to the start site but the putative â box TATGCA be far from the E coli â consensus box TTGACA support the idea that the torR promoter be weakly express in S oneidensis Moreover one hexamer of the TorR operator site overlap the â box and as a result the TorR bind region which extend from position â to position â cover the â box Fig Interaction of TorR with the torR promoter may thus hamper the correct bind of the RNA polymerase to this promoter and consequently TorR may repress expression of its own gene To test a possible negative autoregulation of the torR gene we perform realtime PCR from total RNA extract from MRR cell grow anaerobically with or without TMAO The cDNA sample be synthesize by use random hexamer as primer and the realtime PCR be carry out by use a torR specific primer pair Table RR Realtime PCR be also perform with a Sspecific primer pair s to quantify the amount of S RNA in each sample and the relative level of torR transcript be then normalize to that of the S RNA As show in Table the amount of torR transcript decrease almost threefold when the cell be grow in the presence of TMAO mean that the expression of torR be negative autoregulated as expect from the in vitro experiment Fig Unfortunately the control experiment with RNA extract from the torR strain SOR be not feasible because the mutation in this strain correspond to a ISSo insertion into the torR promoter region lead to the absence of torR transcription However the torR transcript level be similar in the tor strain SOS grow with or without TMAO induction increase by a factor of Â± mean Â± standard deviation thus confirm that the torR gene be negative regulate by phosphorylate TorR In E coli the torR gene be also negative autoregulated but this autoregulation occur even in a tor strain or in the absence of TMAO In fact the E coli torR gene be always repress because phosphorylate as good as unphosphorylated TorR bind to a highaffinity bind site overlap the torR transcription start site The situation be quite different in S oneidensis since torR negative autoregulation occur in the presence of TMAO and thus probably involve only the phosphorylate form of TorR Consequently TorR negative autoregulation maintain the TorR concentration at a low level whatever the growth condition in E coli whereas in S oneidensis it decrease TorR production when TMAO be present in the medium The reason for this subtle difference be unknown but in general negative autoregulation have homeostatic property and allow the production of a precise amount of regulator in the cell Although much than onethird of the transcriptional factor be negative autoregulated in E coli several response regulator prove to be positively autoregulated One proposal to explain positive autoregulation be that a increase concentration of a give response regulator be require in induce condition when the regulator control many gene and must therefore bind to many target at the same time The restrict numb of target for TorR of E coli and S oneidensis may explain why TorR be negative rather than positively autoregulated in both strainsActivation of the gene torF SO by TorR The transcription start site of torF be define by a primer extension experiment with RNA prepare from MRR cell grow anaerobically with TMAO Fig A single start site be locate base upstream of the torF initiation codon and a â promoter box TACGAT be find correctly position relative to the start site In contrast no putative â box can be find to bp upstream of the â box but the TorR bind site be center bp upstream of the start site at a position compatible with that of a activator bind site Fig and To follow expression of torF we carry out realtime PCR experiment from total RNA prepare from strain MRR and SOR grow with or without TMAO As show in Table torF expression be strongly induce by TMAO in strain MRR since the amount of torF transcript increase fold when TMAO be add In contrast torF be poorly induce in strain SOR this result clearly indicate that TorR be responsible for the strong induction of torF and confirm that TorR mediate TMAO signal in S oneidensis By use a plasmidborne torEâ²lacZ fusion we have previously show that the Î²galactosidase activity increase almost fold in the presence of TMAO in the wildtype context whereas no significant increase be observe in the torR strain SOR Although this datum be consistent with a strong TMAO induction of the torECAD operon mediate by TorR they be indirectly assess from a multicopy plasmid To confirm tor operon activation and to compare it with that of torF we carry out realtime PCR with torCspecific primer CC and the cDNA sample generate for the torF expression study As show in Table the torC induction factor be fold in strain MRR whereas it be close to in strain SOR The realtime PCR experiment thus confirm that the torECAD operon be activate by TorR but the level of induction be somewhat low for the torECAD operon than for the torF gene This result be quite unexpected because the torECAD operon encode the TMAO reductase respiratory complex and thus be suppose to be the main target of the TMAO response regulator TorR In any case the fact that torF be strongly induce by TorR suggest that the TorF protein play a key role either in the TMAO respiratory system or in another TMAOrelated pathway A genomewide transcriptional analysis have recently reveal that in E coli the TorSTorR phosphorelay system positively regulate the tnaLAB operon in addition to torCAD but the TMAO induction factor measure either from DNA array or from lacZ fusion be clearly high for torCAD than for tnaLAB TorF belong to a new family of protein of unknown function The torF gene SO be a monocistronic unit encode a putative protein of residue with a calculate molecular mass of Da The amino acid sequence be compare with that of the protein list in the database and significant similarity be detect with several putative protein encode by various genome of proteobacteria include Azotobacter vinelandii Avin Bordetella pertussis BP and Caulobacter crescentus CC However no protein homologous to TorF be encode by the relate genome of Vibrio cholera or by that of E coli and in particular no similarity be find with either TnaA or TnaB Interestingly one of the homologous protein be encode by a gene of S oneidensis SO mean that the torF gene may have be duplicate in this strain So far no biological function have be assign to any of this homologue this protein can thus be classify in a new family of conserve protein of unknown functionConcluding remark The analysis of the DNA target of the TMAO regulator TorR of S oneidensis reveal that TorR recognize highly specific operator site contain a direct repeat of the sequence TTCATA The TorR bind site be only find in the promoter of torECAD torF and torR and they allow TMAO induction of the torECAD and torF unit and TMAO repression of the torR gene Since the torF gene which encode a protein of unknown function be coregulated with the torECAD operon encode the TMAO respiratory system we propose that TorF play a specific role relate to TMAO respiration Future investigation will aim to define the function of TorF and of the other

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00112-19","Microbiomes contain many level of biological information and integrate across the level create a holistic understand of hostmicrobiome interaction In my research on the evolution and ecology of avian microbiomes I use two complementary framework the microbiome as a community and the microbiome as a trait of the host We draw on classic ecological and evolutionary theory and modern statistical model to advance our understand in each of this framework and then integrate what we have learn into a good understand of hostassociated microbiomes host evolution and microbial biodiversity Ecological theory that bear on process such as community assembly and metacommunities be good suit for application to microbiomes Phylogenetic comparative method can quantify the fit of evolutionary model and detect correlation between trait and correlation between trait and the rate of evolution this method allow the inference of evolutionary process from contemporary pattern PERSPECTIVE It be clear that the microbiome can influence host biology in myriad way sufficient to affect host fitness On the level of the individual host the microbiome can tip the balance between health and disease promote or deter proper development and influence behavior It be also clear that there be variation within population in microbiome composition and function ie a axis of individual variation that be expose to natural selection If the microbiome can influence the fitness of a host then we can also ask how it have contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of population to the speciation or extinction of lineage or to the diversification of host biology this big question cannot be answer experimentally and attest to the importance of wild organism and descriptive science for understand the role of the microbiome in evolutionary biology My research be primarily interest in the ecology and evolution of the avian microbiome bird be a globally distribute class of vertebrate that encompass immense ecological and morphological diversity This make them a excellent comparative system in which to try to discover fundamental rule that shape interaction between host and their microbiomes Their suite of adaptation particularly feather and power flight have impact many aspect of avian biology and the microbiome may be no exception How have microbe and microbiomes influence bird biology include ecology and phylogeny How have bird influence the microbiome and its member To answer this question and fully understand the process shape hostassociated microbiomes we need a ecological understand of the microbiome as a community of interact individual the microbeâs perspective and a evolutionary understand of the microbiome as a trait of the host the hostâs perspectiveMICROBIOMES AS community All biodiversity organize into and function as member of community FigÂ How community assembly and persistence be accomplish be fundamental issue in ecology that apply to macroorganisms and microorganism alike âNichebasedâ community assembly state that organism have ecological niche that dictate and assure their role in a community a alternative view be that community assemble in a neutral way or in a way that be agnostic to ecological niche The debate concern the theory of nichebased assembly and neutral assembly of community be ongoing in the field of ecology and I be interest in whether and how this theory be support in avian microbiomes particularly across body site with differ property and purpose The scale of interrogation can have a impact on whether we discern neutral or nichebased pattern and give the many hierarchical level in hostassociated microbiomes the spatial and phylogenetic scale that we consider can matter greatly Another consideration be intraspecific variability in microbiomes which exist within the composition and function of microbiomes Intraspecific variation compare to interspecific variation at a give scale may influence our inference of the process structure community and should be quantify when possible Perhaps microbiomes support both nichebased and neutral component for their community assembly see eg reference The âcompetitive lottery modelâ state that niche in a community can be fill only by organism with particular functional trait and that any organism that have the trait and arrive first fill that niche Functional redundancyâwhere exact species be interchangeable if they perform specific functionsâcan be a powerful and common force in microbial community review in reference Our application of community assembly theory may be greatly improve by consider such biological property of microbe and microbiomes review in reference If microbiome assembly be base on function rather than taxonomy a method that describe taxonomy but not functional capability will not reflect community assembly process and may positively mislead interpretation In my laboratory We be gather shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datum to good understand the assembly and stability of microbial function in avian microbiomes We be also pursue how diversity in this method compare to the taxonomic diversity estimate use S rRNA survey To get a complete picture of the microbiome we be in the nascent stage of incorporate the virome and eukaryotic microorganism into our diversity estimate as good In the near future A good understand of microbial community will come with improve method for describe their fundamental biological unit We be hinder by a lack of a accept microbial species concept philosophically and practically Unfortunately it seem as if the much sequence datum we have the much elusive a definition for species become The use of operational taxonomic unit OTUs to delimit âspeciesâ have be invaluable but the use of any single marker have limitation I believe that S rRNA survey will continue to provide important datum contribute to our understand of microbiomes in novel system How we complement them to properly describe the functional and taxonomic diversity of community use additional molecular method be a excite prospect that be or will soon be within reach for many laboratory as the cost of highthroughput sequence continue to drop per base database of fulllength S rRNA gene of fulllength genome and of annotate gene family will continue to grow as novel environment be investigate describe novel microbiomes be also important from a basic biodiversity perspective discover the undiscovered require investment in undescribed host or novel ecology and may have farreaching benefit such as add branch to the tree of life or discover human lifesaving drugsMICROBIOMES AS A TRAIT OF THE HOST The microbiome can be view as a trait of a host FigÂ understand the force shape trait distribution across species be a fundamental goal of organismal biology Largescale pattern in morphological behavioral ecological or genomic trait can indicate the process act above the level of the individual and cannot be address in laboratory setting or by analyze a single species Importantly many trait be not independent of phylogeny and phylogenetic comparative method provide one way to account for phylogeny in the study of the distribution of trait among species Thus we can use this method to infer what evolutionary process have generate the microbiome and to good understand the role that microbiomes have play in host evolution One specific use of phylogenetic comparative method be to assess how good a evolutionary model fit the contemporary distribution of trait value give empirical trait value for a set of species and a phylogeny that unite them we can first infer the state of the trait at all internal node of the tree include the root Brownian motion model be commonly use as the neutral expectation for how a trait will vary over a particular phylogeny Information criterion then compare the neutral model against model that incorporate selection or model with no phylogenetic signal at all In this application we may discern whether selection need be invoke to explain a trait A 2 use of phylogenetic comparative method be to estimate the correlation between trait or how a trait relate to the environment Here we may determine factor such as whether a particular host genetic variant be correlate to the microbiome A 3 application be to evaluate a traitâs role in speciation and extinction rate Many option now exist for such test include the popular binarystate speciation and extinction BiSSE model Here we may ask whether the microbiome contribute to the rapid diversification or relative stasis of avian lineage Interdisciplinary microbiome researcher should be aware of the extensive literature on the strength and limitation of phylogenetic comparative method see eg reference and and the statistical assumption of specific evolutionary model see eg reference One important consideration for any model evaluate the microbiome as a trait be identify what property of the microbiome contain information about the host and what property represent a reflection of the environment or be stochastic It be unclear how to good quantify microbiomes at the hostspecies level as a single value How do we accurately summarize community as complex as the microbiome Comparative analysis require large sample size and wellestimated tree Practically speak the much costeffective way to generate microbiome datum from hundred of individual be by S rRNA survey However there be know weakness of S datum that may make it undesirable for the purpose of phylogenetic comparative method Consider again functional redundancy or a competitive lottery model of community assemblyâthe taxon in a sample may not reflect the selection that be determine whether a microbe have a role in a microbiome Function may be much important and much stable than taxon in microbiomes use current S rRNA method without also measure absolute abundance mean datum be strictly compositional so how taxonomic group compare in absolute term across individual cannot be determine FigÂ In my laboratory We be investigate how phylogenetic comparative method perform use S datum and assess model fit across neutral model model that incorporate selection and model that contain no phylogenetic signal We be code the microbiome in term of composition and diversity under the null hypothesis that the microbiome contain phylogenetic signal We be gather datum on the functional capability of microbiomes and will code them for phylogenetic comparative method analysis to compare to the model that fit the taxonomic S datum Importantly our analysis benefit greatly from the wealth of ornithological research on bird life history physiology ecology and behavior Avian microbiome science can also leverage the extensive avian genomics literature to both construct and test hypothesis about the relationship between bird and microbe One excite example of this be the OpenWings Project httpwwwopenwingsorgâan ongoing collaboration among major ornithological collection that will gather genomic datum ultraconserved element UCEs from each of the name bird speciesIn the near future Microbiome research be interdisciplinary and dependent on the foundational paper and cut edge research in many field As our method and finding become much sophisticate I hope to see far integration between theory phylogenetic method and model and community ecology in the context of hostassociated microbiomes We should utilize the wealth of information that have be publish in recent decade in the field of ecology and evolution but there be also need for development of new model that incorporate microorganismspecific parameter eg horizontal gene transfer As microbiome research incorporate new marker in addition to S and as we find little expensive way to mine the much meaningful datum from microbiomes it will become clear how to code the microbiome for comparative analysesINTEGRATION OF THE MICROBEâS PERSPECTIVE WITH THE HOSTâS PERSPECTIVE Microbiomes be hierarchical and the various layer of interaction may contain conflict signal Variation be a major outstanding issue for me and we be currently collect datum to describe the taxonomic and functional diversity across the entire species range of a endanger saltmarsh specialist the Saltmarsh Sparrow work with the Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program SHARP we have collect datum from over population across the entire breed range of the species We will be able to estimate gamma diversity for the species and elucidate the geographic structure of the microbiome This be also a important basic biodiversity project as the Saltmarsh Sparrow be project to be extinct by and describe their microbiome now before substantive human intervention will give us a baseline of their natural microbiome Gamma diversity be unknown for many if not much host but can be important for understand both the community ecology perspective as good as the host trait perspective How much variation exist in the microbiome This question can be especially important because as species interaction change in a change environment the role of functional redundancy can change as good acknowledgment I

menaquinone significantly reduce the survival advantage of PÂ aeruginosa FigÂ A This support the notion that the protective function of BCN in infect bacterium can be inhibit in vivo FigÂ B DISCUSSION Lipocalins be a ancient family of small protein find in all kingdom of life that have the ability to bind hydrophobic ligand but have different function depend on the cell type and organism In many case and particularly in bacterium their function be unclear despite that BCN orthologs can be find in the majority of complete genome by datum mine In this study we discover that secrete BCNs contribute to antibiotic resistance by capture and neutralize antibiotic in the bacterial milieu BCNs bind a range of antibiotic with diverse chemical structure increase antibiotic resistance in vitro and enhance bacterial survival in vivo The effect of BCNs on multiple antibiotic and their wide conservation in much bacterial species distinguish this mechanism from the recently discover effect of membranereleased phospholipid on daptomycin which be restrict to this particular antibiotic and to SÂ aureus Our structural work suggest that BCNs have two bind mode Hydrophobic molecule like Nile red and vitamin E and K can bind in the interior of the lipocalin tunnel while antibiotic molecule interact with the rim and their bind property be much weak This suggest that antibiotic bind and scavenge be not primary function of secrete BCNs but this protein may also have other asyetundiscovered role We propose that the antibiotic bind ability of BCNs become particularly relevant under condition in which antibiotic cannot effectively kill bacterium and their presence at sublethal concentration elicit protective bacterial stress response Exposure to antibiotic trigger complex and multifactorial bacterial process involve change in regulation metabolism and energy generation â There be also a body of evidence indicate that antibiotic at sublethal concentration can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen intermediate â and also that oxidative stress associate with pathological inflammation reduce the efficacy of antibiotic The increase bcnA transcription upon antibiotic treatment indicate that this gene respond to antibioticinduced stress Recent work with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana show that two lipocalins that be relate to bacterial orthologs have distinct but overlap function essential for protection from lipid peroxidation far the mammalian odorantbinding protein a soluble lipocalin protect the bacterial cell from hydrogen peroxideinduced stress when overexpress in EÂ coli whereas PÂ aeruginosa PAO BcnAPa be overexpress in response to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat Donnarumma et al have recently suggest that the Neisseria BCN GNA be a ubiquinone bind protein Since ubiquinone be a cofactor that be mainly involve in the electron transport chain and have antioxidant property this author propose a role for this protein in antioxidant defense perhaps by deliver ubiquinone to the bacterial membrane or the periplasmic space Ubiquinones be prenylated benzoquinones Interestingly the majority of know crystal structure of bacterial lipocalins include BcnA and BcnB have be solve with octaprenyllike molecule bind to the lipocalin tunnel although it be not certain if the presence of this molecule correspond to a physiological substrate or be a artifact associate with protein purification prior to crystallization Therefore while it may be reasonable to propose that BCNs can play a role in oxidative stress response the mechanism involve

University for assistance with the mouse infection experiment IMPORTANCE Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focus on target essential function within bacterial cell We discover a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operate in the extracellular space which depend on bacterial protein molecule call lipocalins this molecule be highly conserve in much bacterium and have the ability to capture different class of antibiotic outside bacterial cell We also discover that liposoluble vitamin such as vitamin E overcome in vitro and in vivo antibiotic resistance mediate by bacterial lipocalins provide a unexpected new alternative to combat resistance by use this vitamin or its derivative as antibiotic adjuvant INTRODUCTION treat infection be become increasingly difficult since microbe often show intrinsic highlevel resistance to virtually all clinically approve antibiotic Ineffective microbial kill and exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentration elicit adaptive bacterial stress response enhance antibiotic resistance and tolerance â Much have be learn about antibiotic resistance mechanism at the cellular level but whether microbe subvert the action of antibiotic before they come in contact with bacterial cell have remain largely unexplore with the exception of Î²lactamases which be often trap in release membrane vesicle â and the recent observation that Staphylococcus aureus inactivate daptomycin by release membrane phospholipid Burkholderia cenocepacia be a highly multidrug resistant opportunistic Gramnegative bacterium that cause serious respiratory infection in patient with cystic fibrosis bacterium of the genus Burkholderia be notorious for their ability to resist the action of multiple class of antimicrobial represent a attractive model to understand intrinsic mechanism of resistance in opportunistic bacterium Recently we show that in response to sublethal antibiotic concentration BÂ cenocepacia produce and release molecule such as the polyamine putrescine and YceI a conserve hypothetical protein of unknown function YceI protein be a family of bacterial lipocalins BCNs which be small protein widely conserve in Gramnegative and Grampositive bacterium but whose physiological role be unclear In coculture experiment BÂ cenocepacia protect Pseudomonas aeruginosa from kill by different bactericidal antibiotic This effect be abrogate in the BÂ cenocepacia ÎbcnAbcnB doubledeletion mutant but the individual contribution of each BCN paralog and its mechanism remain unknown Here we show that secrete BcnA contribute to increase resistance of BÂ cenocepacia to various class of antibiotic in vitro and in vivo The expression of BCN orthologs from PÂ aeruginosa Mycobacterium tuberculosis and methicillinresistant SÂ aureus in a BÂ cenocepacia ÎbcnA mutant recapitulate this function Experimental and computational study reveal that BCNs bind to a range of antibiotic thus prevent their antibacterial activity and contribute to resistance Xray crystallography study of BCN structure in combination with dock and MD simulation have help us to rationalize plausible bind mode We also discover that fatsoluble vitamin bind BcnA with a high affinity than antibiotic enable them to outcompete antibiotic This find provide a clinically applicable strategy whereby know vitamin can become antibiotic adjuvant by increase the concentration of free antibiotic in the proximity of bacterial cell thereby boost their microbicidal activityRESULTS BcnA be a secrete bacterial lipocalin require for full resistance of BÂ cenocepacia to different class of antibiotic We investigate the role of BÂ cenocepacia BcnA BCAL and BcnB BCAL by construct individual deletion mutant in their correspond gene and assess bacterial susceptibility to model bactericidal antibiotic represent different class include rifamycins mRNA transcription inhibitor fluoroquinolone DNA replication inhibitor several Î²lactams cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitor and cationic antimicrobial peptide cell membrane active agent The ÎbcnA mutant but not the ÎbcnB mutant have increase susceptibility

protein synthesis inhibitor FigÂ A see antibiotic chemical structure in FigÂ S in the supplemental material Similarly we also test model bacteriostatic antibiotic represent different class The ÎbcnA

dihydrofolate reductase fold MIC reduction while no effect be observe with the macrolide protein synthesis inhibitor azithromycin FigÂ A see FigÂ S Supplemental Material FIGÂ SÂ Chemical structure of

increase upon exposure to norfloxacin and ceftazidime FigÂ SA Thus the bcnA and bcnB gene respond to antibiotic stress but they appear to be differentially regulate bcnA and bcnB be locate on the same strand Â bp apart FigÂ C Immediately upstream of bcnA there be a open read frame BCAL also transcribe on the same strand that encode a predict cytochrome b protein Putative promoter region be find upstream of BCAL and downstream from bcnB next to a predict Rhoindependent transcription termination sequence The genomic organization of the bcn region suggest that BCAL bcnA and bcnB be cotranscribed and may form a operon However the transcribe bp intergenic region between bcnA and bcnB have the potential to form strong RNA secondary structure which may explain the differential regulation of the two gene by antibiotic The secretion of the BcnA and BcnB protein be also investigate by use FLAGtagged derivative only BcnA be secrete extracellularly into the growth medium FigÂ SB From this experiment we conclude that BcnA be the major contributor to intrinsic antibiotic resistance upon antibiotic stress and be secrete into the extracellular bacterial milieu Supplemental

sequester antibiotic BCNs bind to diverse hydrophobic molecule â hence we hypothesize that BCNs can capture antibiotic and reduce their effective concentration in the bacterial milieu a antibiotic bioassay demonstrate that BcnA sequester rifampin PmB norfloxacin and ceftazidime in descend order of magnitude but not gentamicin FigÂ A see FigÂ SA to E far the relative affinity of BcnA for antibiotic be determine in vitro by bind competition of antibiotic with Nile red in complex with BcnA Nile red be a fluorophore use to test hydrophobic bind site in protein The calculate bind

FigÂ A Notably the bind of BcnB to Nile red occur with fold low affinity than that of BcnA FigÂ SN to Q agree with the lesser role of BcnB in antibiotic resistance The involvement of hydrophobic moiety in the interaction of ligand with BcnA be suggest by the significantly high Ki value of the PmB nonapeptide which lack the hydrophobic Nterminal tail of PmB relative to that of PmB FigÂ B see FigÂ SF to I Notably azithromycin and gentamicin the only antibiotic not show the antibiotic sensitivity reduction phenotype with the ÎbcnA mutant FigÂ A be the only antibiotic test that lack

survival advantage Liposoluble vitamin inhibit BcnAmediated antibiotic capture Conceivably molecule with superior bind affinity for BCNs than that of antibiotic should prevent BCNmediated resistance Since lipophilic moiety be predict to bind deep within the BCN pocket we test normal dietary hydrophobic supplement recommend for several patient group include cystic fibrosis patient such as the fatsoluble vitamin Î±tocopherol vitamin E and menaquinone vitamin K dock of Î±tocopherol show its alkyl chain bury in the BcnA tunnel and its cyclic head place toward the entrance similar to the Nile red bind pose FigÂ E Of note Î±tocopherol follow by menaquinone exhibit very low Ki value in Nile red displacement assay to order of magnitude low than the Ki value of antibiotic indicative of their high affinity for BcnA FigÂ B This prompt us to test the BCNinhibitory activity of fatsoluble vitamin in vivo In BcnAtreated GÂ mellonella larva infect with PÂ aeruginosa PAO Â ÂµM Î±tocopherol or menaquinone significantly reduce the survival advantage of PÂ aeruginosa FigÂ A This support the notion that the protective function of BCN in infect bacterium can be inhibit in vivo FigÂ B DISCUSSION Lipocalins be a ancient family of small protein find in all kingdom of life that have the ability to bind hydrophobic ligand but have different function depend on the cell type and organism In many case and particularly in bacterium their function be unclear despite that BCN orthologs can be find in the majority of complete genome by datum mine In this study we discover that secrete BCNs contribute to antibiotic resistance by capture and neutralize antibiotic in the bacterial milieu BCNs bind a range of antibiotic with diverse chemical structure increase antibiotic resistance in vitro and enhance bacterial survival in vivo The effect of BCNs on multiple antibiotic and their wide conservation in much bacterial species distinguish this mechanism from the recently discover effect of membranereleased phospholipid on daptomycin which be restrict to this particular antibiotic and to SÂ aureus Our structural work suggest that BCNs have two bind mode Hydrophobic molecule like Nile red and vitamin E and K can bind in the interior of the lipocalin tunnel while antibiotic molecule interact with the rim and their bind property be much weak This suggest that antibiotic bind and scavenge be not primary function of secrete BCNs but this protein may also have other asyetundiscovered role We propose that the antibiotic bind ability of BCNs become particularly relevant under condition in which antibiotic cannot effectively kill bacterium and their presence at sublethal concentration elicit protective bacterial stress response Exposure to antibiotic trigger complex and multifactorial bacterial process involve change in regulation metabolism and energy generation â There be also a body of evidence indicate that antibiotic at sublethal concentration can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen intermediate â and also that oxidative stress associate with pathological inflammation reduce the efficacy of antibiotic The increase bcnA transcription upon antibiotic treatment indicate that this gene respond to antibioticinduced stress Recent work with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana show that two lipocalins that be relate to bacterial orthologs have distinct but overlap function essential for protection from lipid peroxidation far the mammalian odorantbinding protein a soluble lipocalin protect the bacterial cell from hydrogen peroxideinduced stress when overexpress in EÂ coli whereas PÂ aeruginosa PAO BcnAPa be overexpress in response to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat Donnarumma et al have recently suggest that the Neisseria BCN GNA be a ubiquinone bind protein Since ubiquinone be a cofactor that be mainly involve in the electron transport chain and have antioxidant property this author propose a role for this protein in antioxidant defense perhaps by deliver ubiquinone to the bacterial membrane or the periplasmic space Ubiquinones be prenylated benzoquinones Interestingly the majority of know crystal structure of bacterial lipocalins include BcnA and BcnB have be solve with octaprenyllike molecule bind to the lipocalin tunnel although it be not certain if the presence of this molecule correspond to a physiological substrate or be a artifact associate with protein purification prior to crystallization Therefore while it may be reasonable to propose that BCNs can play a role in oxidative stress response the mechanism involve remain to be elucidate In summary we have uncover a new mechanism of general antibiotic resistance operate extracellularly base on BCNmediated antibiotic capture that provide bacterium with a selective advantage to overcome antibiotic toxicity particularly in chronic infection where antibiotic treatment often fail far we reveal a strategy to disrupt antibiotic capture and propose
