<i>Actinoplanes friuliensis</i> produces the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, which is a cyclic peptide with one exocyclic amino acid linked to a branched-chain fatty acid acyl residue. The structural relationship to daptomycin and the excellent antibacterial performance of friulimicin make the antibiotic an attractive drug candidate. The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from <i>A. friuliensis</i> was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. By using heterologous gene expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we provide biochemical evidence for the stereoselective synthesis of <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-pipecolinic acid by the deduced protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene <i>pip</i>. Furthermore, we show the involvement of the <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> genes in the biosynthesis of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid by gene inactivation and subsequent feeding experiments.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div role=""paragraph"">In recent years, the sequences of numerous gene clusters involved in the synthesis of many secondary metabolites have become available for comparison and exploitation. The programmed manipulation of genes encoding enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways offers promise for redesigning existing antibiotic structures to create antibiotics with new activities and the ability to overcome bacterial resistance (<a href=""#R50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R50"">50</a>). Therefore, each newly analyzed gene cluster represents a new tool for combinatorial biosynthesis and can provide information about the synthesis of unusual building blocks, such as nonproteinogenic amino acids, acyl residues, and sugar moieties. An interesting group of secondary metabolites for such experiments seems to be bioactive lipopeptides isolated from streptomycetes. So far, only a few biosynthetic gene clusters corresponding to these lipopeptides have been isolated and characterized, such as the clusters for calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA) from <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>), daptomycin from <i>Streptomyces roseosporus</i> (<a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>), and A54145 from <i>Streptomyces fradiae</i> (<a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>). By targeted modification and gene exchange, it is possible to generate new lipopeptide structures (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>, <a href=""#R25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R25"">25</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Another member of this group of secondary metabolites is the antibiotic friulimicin that is produced by the actinomycete <i>Actinoplanes friuliensis</i>. This compound is highly active against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strains (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>). The biosynthesis of this lipopeptide is catalyzed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The eight bioactive lipopeptides isolated from <i>A. friuliensis</i> (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>) consist of 10 amino acids that form a ring structure with one exocyclic amino acid linked to an acyl residue of various chain lengths. The acyl residue is a branched-chain fatty acid with a Î<i>cis3</i> double bond. The structures of four of these lipopeptides are identical to those of known peptide antibiotics of the amphomycin group and possess aspartic acid at the exocyclic position. The other four lipopeptides have asparagine at this position and are known as friulimicins A to D. The peptide component of these friulimicins is characterized by unusual amino acids, such as <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-threo- and <span data-style=""small-caps"">d</span>-erythro-2,3-diaminobutyric acid, <span data-style=""small-caps"">d</span>-pipecolinic acid, and <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-threo-Î²-methylaspartic acid (<a href=""#R48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R48"">48</a>) (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>). The peptide also contains the conserved amino acid sequence DXDG, which is a putative calcium-binding site in the nonribosomally synthesized lipopeptides A54145 (<a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>), daptomycin, and CDA and in the ribosomally assembled calmodulin (<a href=""#R11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R11"">11</a>) (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of the complete gene cluster for the biosynthesis of friulimicin from <i>A. friuliensis</i>. We also describe in detail the functions of enzymes involved in the synthesis of the unusual amino acids 2,3-diaminobutyric acid and pipecolinic acid.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Cosmid 4E08 was shotgun sequenced. Overlapping DNA fragments of cosmids 18M80 and 5P02 were detected by Southern hybridization, subcloned, and sequenced. Sequences were analyzed with Clone Manager 7 (Scientific and Educational Software, Cary, NC), Artemis (<a href=""#R33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R33"">33</a>), Clustal X (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>), GeneDoc (<a href=""#R29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R29"">29</a>), and the NRPS-PKS database (<a href=""#R3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R3"">3</a>). Open reading frames (ORFs) were analyzed using the <i>Actinoplanes teichomyceticus</i> codon usage table (<a href=""#R28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R28"">28</a>). Functional assignments were made using the BLAST program (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>) to compare the deduced gene products with proteins of known functions listed in the NCBI database. Cosmids 18M80, 4E08, and 5P02 cover the regions <i>orfO</i>â² to <i>pstB</i>, <i>lipA</i> to <i>lipE</i>, and <i>pstC</i> to <i>orf33</i>â², respectively (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-1-3""><h3>Construction of plasmids pCMF11 and pCMF10.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">For the construction of the gene disruption mutants, internal fragments of approximately 600 bp of the <i>orfO</i>â² and <i>orfAP</i> genes were obtained by PCR using the primer pair O1/O2 for <i>orfO</i> and the primer pair AP1/AP2 for <i>orfAP</i> (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>). The fragments were cloned into HindIII-EcoRI-digested vector pDS401, resulting in pCMF11 and pCMF10, respectively. Gene disruption mutants were constructed by intergeneric conjugation.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-4""><h3>Construction of plasmids pCMOPApra and pCMTDApra.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">For gene replacement mutagenesis of <i>orfP</i> and <i>orfTD</i>, plasmids pCMOPApr and pCMTDApra were used. The corresponding genes were inactivated by replacing internal fragments of the genes (bp 115 to 156 of <i>orfP</i> and bp 139 to 524 of <i>orfTD</i>) with the apramycin/<i>ermE*p</i> resistance cassette <i>aprP</i> (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>). To lessen possible polar effects, <i>aprP</i> was inserted in the transcriptional direction of the affected genes. The inactivated genes in combination with DNA fragments of 1 to 2 kb from the flanking regions were subsequently cloned into the vector pK18mob (<a href=""#R37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R37"">37</a>), resulting in plasmids pCMOPApra and pCMTDApra, respectively.

<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>pip</i> gene was inactivated by gene replacement as follows: a 7,363-bp MluI fragment from cosmid 5P02, carrying the genes <i>pstD</i>â² to <i>orfP</i>â² (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>), was cloned into pOK12. A 1,950-bp NcoI fragment of the flanking region upstream of <i>pip</i> and a 1,625-bp XhoI fragment of the flanking region downstream of <i>pip</i> from the resulting plasmid were subcloned into pOK12 and pLitmus28, respectively. The two fragments were cut out using EcoRI-XbaI and HindIII-XbaI, respectively, and ligated with HindIII-EcoRI-digested vector pK18mob in one step. The apramycin resistance cassette <i>apr</i> was isolated from pKC505 by EcoRI-PstI digestion, ligated to pLitmus28, and cut out using XbaI and SpeI. The cassette was then integrated into the XbaI restriction site of the pK18mob derivative in the transcriptional direction of <i>pip</i>. The resulting plasmid pCMPipApr was used for intergeneric conjugation between <i>E. coli</i> ET12567(pUB307) and <i>A. friuliensis</i>. Apramycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive double-crossover mutants were selected.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-6""><h3>Construction of the <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> mutants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Plasmid pCMO3Apra, used for the construction of the <i>dabA</i> knockout mutant, was generated as follows: a 4,201-bp StuI-ScaI fragment of cosmid 18M80, carrying the genes <i>regA</i>â² to <i>dabC</i>â² (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>), was subcloned into pMos<i>Blue</i>, which was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The 4,276-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment released was introduced into pK18mob, which was then digested with DraIII; the ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment. The apramycin/<i>ermE*p</i> resistance cassette <i>aprP</i> was isolated from vector pEH13 (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>) after StuI-EcoRV digestion and integrated into the DraIII-restricted pK18mob derivative in the transcriptional direction of <i>dabA</i>, resulting in plasmid pCMO3ApraN.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>dabB</i> knockout mutant was generated as follows: a 6,651-bp StuI-Eco47III fragment was isolated from cosmid 18M80 and cloned into pMos<i>Blue</i>. From the resulting plasmid, a 1,627-bp BamHI-NcoI fragment covering the upstream flanking region and a 1,711-bp SacI fragment covering the downstream flanking region of <i>dabB</i> were subcloned into pLitmus28. These fragments were cut out from the corresponding plasmids using PstI-XbaI and Acc65i-XbaI, respectively, and cloned together with PstI-Acc65i-digested pK18mob in one step. The <i>aprP</i> cassette was isolated from vector pEH13 (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>) after SpeI digestion and integrated into the XbaI-restricted pK18mob derivative in the transcriptional direction of <i>dabB</i>, resulting in plasmid pCMO4Apra.

<div role=""paragraph"">The production of friulimicin by <i>A. friuliensis</i> and the mutants was tested in a bioassay using friulimicin-sensitive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> ATCC 6633. Strains were cultivated in Bacto tryptic soy broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) for 7 days, and cultures were homogenized and spread onto the surface of M65 defined medium agar plates (the recipe is available from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany). After 9 days of incubation at 28Â°C, plugs of equal sizes were cut out and applied to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> test medium (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>). The plates were incubated overnight at 37Â°C, and antibiotic production was evaluated by the detection of zones of growth inhibition around the agar blocks.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-10""><h3>Cosynthesis of friulimicin by pairs of mutants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Pairs of different mutants were spread in smears 2 mm apart and approximately 1 cm in width on M65 agar plates. After 9 days of incubation at 28Â°C, strips of 2 cm perpendicular to the smears were cut out and used for antibiotic detection as described above. The shape of the growth inhibition zone was observed, and the two mutants were classified as the converter and the secretor.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-11""><h3>Cloning of <i>pip</i> for heterologous expression and genetic complementation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>pip</i> gene was isolated by PCR using the primer pair PI1/PI2 (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>), and the PCR product was cloned into pMos<i>Blue</i>. The resulting plasmid was digested with BglII and EcoRI, and the <i>pip</i> fragment was cloned into BglII-EcoRI-digested pRSETB, resulting in pRF37. This plasmid carries the sequence for the production of an N-terminal-His fusion protein and was used for heterologous expression.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For integration into the genome of the <i>A. friuliensis pip</i> knockout mutant, pRF37 was digested with XbaI and EcoRI, yielding a fragment encoding the His-tagged protein and the ribosome-binding site of pRSETB. The fragment was cloned downstream of the <i>ermE*p</i> sequence of pEM4. The expression construct together with the <i>ermE*p</i> sequence was cut out using HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into pOK12. In order to obtain a different selection marker for the transfer into the apramycin-resistant <i>A. friuliensis</i> mutants, the hygromycin resistance cassette <i>hyg</i> from vector pHPÎ©Hyg was cut out with DraI and inserted into EcoRV-digested pSET152. The plasmid obtained, pSETHyg, was linearized with BamHI, and the overhanging ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment. The expression construct from the pOK12 derivative was isolated as an EcoRV-StuI fragment and ligated into the linearized pSETHyg, containing the Î¦C31 attachment site for genomic integration.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-12""><h3>Construction of vector pSET345XEHyg for the genetic complementation of the <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> knockout mutants.</h3>

<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Organization of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Heinzelmann and coworkers previously identified a 15.4-kb DNA fragment of the <i>A. friuliensis</i> friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster located on cosmid 18M80 (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>, <a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). The missing upstream section of the gene cluster was identified by further sequence analysis of this cosmid. In order to complete the sequencing of the friulimicin gene cluster downstream of the ORFs contained on 18M80, a cosmid library for <i>A. friuliensis</i> was screened with a probe derived from the right end of the DNA insert of cosmid 18M80. Large overlapping and missing parts on cosmid 4E08 were identified. Repeated screening using a probe derived from the end of the DNA insert of the newly isolated cosmid led to the identification of cosmid 5P02. The assembly of the sequences of the three overlapping cosmid inserts resulted in a stretch of approximately 70.8 kb.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The putative ORFs and genetic organization of this chromosomal region are depicted in Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>. We identified putative promoters in intergenic regions with suitable sizes or with a change in the direction of transcription. We also proposed the functions of proteins encoded by the 33 detectable ORFs based on significant similarities of the deduced amino acid sequences to sequences of known proteins or conserved domains. Relevant features of the ORFs are summarized in Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Determination of the gene cluster boundaries.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We could not clearly identify the boundaries of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster based on the deduced functions of the gene products (Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>). The regulatory genes <i>regA</i> and <i>regD</i> have already been shown to be a part of the gene cluster by using gene inactivation experiments (to be published elsewhere). To determine whether <i>orfO</i>â² and <i>orfAP</i>, located upstream of <i>regA</i>, and <i>orfP</i> and <i>orfTD</i>, located downstream of <i>regD</i> (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>), represent friulimicin biosynthetic genes, the corresponding genes were inactivated by gene disruption (<i>orfO</i>â² and <i>orfAP</i>) and gene replacement (<i>orfP</i> and <i>orfTD</i>) using plasmids pCMF11/pCMF10 and pCMOPApra/ pCMTDApra, respectively (see Materials and Methods). The genotypes of the generated mutants were proven by Southern hybridization (data not shown) and analyzed in a bioassay (see Materials and Methods). Inactivation of any of these genes had no effect on friulimicin biosynthesis (data not shown), and therefore these genes are not involved. It is reasonable to assume that <i>regA</i> and <i>regD</i> represent the left and right ends of the cluster. With this assumption, a total of 24 ORFs define the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster, covering approximately 61.1 kb.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>NRPS.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Four genes of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster encode the nonribosomal peptide synthetases PstA to PstD. Similarity to PstB and PstD was found in the daptomycin producer <i>Streptomyces filamentosus</i> (Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>). The domain organization was analyzed in silico using the highly conserved core motifs of NRPS (for a review, see reference <a href=""#R39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R39"">39</a>). According to the peptide structure of friulimicin, 11 adenylating domains were found: one in PstA, two in PstB, six in PstC, and two in PstD. The gene encoding the monomodular synthetase PstA is separated from the other NRPS genes by a set of nine genes involved in transport and regulation, the synthesis of methylaspartic acid, and the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component. The N-terminal region of PstA (approximately 210 amino acids) shows no sequence similarity to any NRPS or polyketide synthase domains with known functions. Epimerization domains are located at the ends of PstB and PstC in the modules 3 and 9, in accordance with the <span data-style=""small-caps"">d</span> configuration of pipecolinic acid and the Dab-9 amino acid residue. This result is consistent with the published stereochemical structure of the friulimicin and amphomycin peptides (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>, <a href=""#R48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R48"">48</a>). PstD ends with a thioesterase domain for regiospecific cyclization. The friulimicin branched lactam ring is built from the C terminus of proline and the amino side chain of Dab-2. The thioesterase domain may be a useful tool for the chemoenzymatic generation of other lipopeptide derivatives. Such an approach has been used for the synthesis of daptomycin derivatives with the recombinant cyclization domain of the <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> CDA NRPS (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>The synthesis of nonproteinogenic amino acids.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The peptide core of friulimicin includes methylaspartic acid, which is provided by a glutamate mutase complex encoded by genes <i>glmA</i> and <i>glmB</i> (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>), and the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid at position 3 and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid at positions 2 and 9 (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The deduced amino acid sequence of the <i>pip</i> gene product (Pip; 339 amino acids) shows high similarities to the sequences of lysine and ornithine cyclodeaminases; the former are thought to be responsible for the synthesis of pipecolinic acid. <i>rapL</i> in the rapamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> encodes a protein with 48% sequence identity to Pip. RapL has high sequence similarity to an ornithine cyclodeaminase from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, and its involvement in the synthesis of pipecolinic acid was shown by Khaw et al. (<a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>) and Gatto et al. (<a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>). It catalyzes the deaminative cyclization of lysine to pipecolinic acid; therefore, the enzyme is considered to be a lysine cyclodeaminase (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine whether <i>pip</i> is involved in friulimicin biosynthesis, we inactivated the gene by replacing an internal 979-bp NcoI-XhoI fragment with an apramycin resistance cassette, resulting in the mutant AF-PIP-32. The genotype of the mutant was confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). The mutant did not produce friulimicin, as indicated by the loss of antibiotic activity in the bioassay (data not shown). This phenotype was attributed to the loss of <i>pip</i> gene function by successful genetic complementation and the subsequent restoration of friulimicin production (see Materials and Methods). Mutant AF-PIP-32 had friulimicin activity when grown on M65 medium supplemented with racemic pipecolinic acid, whereas other nonproducing mutants, e.g., AF-O3N-10 and AF-O4-23 (see below), did not have antibiotic activity when grown on this medium.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To verify pipecolinic acid production by Pip, the <i>pip</i> gene on plasmid pRF37 under the control of the T7 promoter was heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys (see Materials and Methods). Soluble N-terminally His-tagged Pip was produced, as shown by purification using metal chelate affinity chromatography with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin under native conditions and subsequent Western blot analysis using the antibody epitope (Xpress epitope) in the recombinant protein for visualization (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4A</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To show the in vivo production of pipecolinic acid, cell pellets of the expression strain <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys(pRF37) and of <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys(pRSETB) were extracted twice with 80% ethanol, and the corresponding ethanol-soluble fractions were analyzed by HPLC and TLC and compared. The HPLC profile of the <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys(pRF37) extract revealed a new peak at about 3.1 min; no such peak was observed for the negative control <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys(pRSETB) (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4C</a>). The mass spectrometry spectrum of the new peak revealed the expected molecular mass of pipecolinic acid (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4D</a>). The results were confirmed by coinjection with pipecolinic acid as the internal standard. With the detection of <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-pipecolinic acid in the ethanol-soluble fraction of the expression strain, the in vivo activity of the His-tagged lysine cyclodeaminase equivalent in a heterologous host was demonstrated. The chiral specificity of the heterologously produced enzyme in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3)pLys was determined by chiral-plate TLC and densitometric analysis. Only <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-pipecolinic acid was found within the ethanol-soluble fraction of the expression strain (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4B</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Owing to the ability to introduce reverse turns into peptides, pipecolinic acid and its derivatives are frequently used as a structural moiety in a number of synthetic pharmaceuticals (<a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>, <a href=""#R44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R44"">44</a>). The incorporation of unusual amino acids such as pipecolinic acid also seems to increase the proteolytic stability of these compounds. The biological activity of a molecule is often dependent upon its absolute configuration (<a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>). Therefore, it would be desirable to have access to nonracemic pipecolinic acid. Pip seems to be a good candidate for the biotechnological production of <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-pipecolinic acid, which can then be used as a building block for the synthesis of bioactive peptides.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To date, the biosynthetic mechanism of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid is unknown. We attempted to elucidate the steps in 2,3-diaminobutyric acid synthesis by identifying genes within the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster encoding proteins with similarities to enzymes of amino acid metabolism. The ORFs designated <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> and <i>dabC</i> encode proteins with similarities to cysteine synthases and to a fusion protein containing both an argininosuccinate lyase and a ligase domain, respectively (Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>). Equivalents of these ORFs are present in the symbiosis island of <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i> (<a href=""#R43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R43"">43</a>), a rhizobacterium that also contains small amounts of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid (<a href=""#R40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R40"">40</a>). We inactivated <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> to test their involvement in 2,3-diaminobutyric acid synthesis. The <i>dabA</i> gene was subjected to insertional mutagenesis using plasmid pCMO3ApraN. This plasmid carries the apramycin/<i>ermE*p</i> resistance cassette <i>aprP</i> in the middle of the <i>dabA</i> gene. A <i>dabB</i> knockout mutant was constructed by replacing a 1,011-bp NcoI-SacI fragment of the gene with the <i>aprP</i> cassette by using plasmid pCMO4Apra. Since in silico data suggest that the genes <i>expB</i>, <i>dabA</i>, <i>dabB</i>, <i>dabC</i>, <i>pstA</i>, and <i>orf7</i> are translationally coupled, they may together form an operon. Therefore, <i>ermE*p</i> was introduced in the transcriptional direction of the inactivated genes in both mutants to lessen the polar effects on genes downstream of the inactivation site. The genotypes of the resulting apramycin-resistant, kanamycin-sensitive mutants AF-O3N-10 and AF-O4-23 were confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5A to D</a>). In these experiments, instead of a 4.6-kb BamHI fragment characteristic of the wild-type DNA, hybridizing 1.7-kb and 0.9-kb BamHI fragments in the corresponding <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> mutants, respectively, were detected. Friulimicin production was abolished in both mutants (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5E</a>), which indicated that both genes are essential for friulimicin biosynthesis. The mutants were genetically complemented by the cloning of a native 6,651-bp StuI-Eco47III fragment of cosmid 18M80, carrying part of <i>regA</i>, <i>expB</i>, <i>dabA</i>, <i>dabB</i>, <i>dabC</i>, and part of <i>pstA</i>, downstream of <i>ermE*p</i> and the integration of the cloned fragment into the genomes of the mutants via the Î¦C31 attachment site (see Materials and Methods). The complemented mutants produced friulimicin. Despite the fact that an unintended polar effect on <i>dabC</i> cannot absolutely be excluded, the phenotypes of mutants AF-O3N-10 and AF-O4-23 seem to be the result of a correct mutagenesis event.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For feeding experiments, 2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i>-diaminobutyric acid was synthesized according to the procedure described by Han et al. (<a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>). The synthesis of the 2<i>S</i>,3<i>R</i> form failed for unknown reasons. 2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i>-Diaminobutyric acid was not able to restore antibiotic activity in the <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> knockout mutants. Therefore, we assume that 2<i>S</i>,3<i>R-</i>diaminobutyric acid is specifically activated by the A domains of the corresponding peptide synthetase modules. The 2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i> form at position 9 is subsequently formed by the epimerization domain of this module. This is in accordance with the stereospecific incorporation of amino acids in the biosynthesis of other nonribosomal peptides, e.g., that of gramicidin. In this example, a <span data-style=""small-caps"">d</span>-leucine thioester intermediate at the <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-leucine-binding site completely inhibits peptide synthesis (<a href=""#R36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R36"">36</a>). The configuration is probably controlled at the peptide bond formation step (<a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">2<i>S</i>,3<i>R</i>-diaminobutyric acid was obtained by the hydrolysis of pure friulimicin D and subsequent partial purification. The <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> knockout mutants, fed the water-soluble components of fraction 2N containing both 2<i>S</i>,3<i>R-</i> and 2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i>-diaminobutyric acid, produced friulimicin as detected by the formation of a zone of growth inhibition in a bioassay (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5E</a>), whereas the mutants, fed a mixture of the individual amino acids present in the friulimicin peptide core except for 2,3-diaminobutyric acid, did not synthesize the antibiotic (data not shown). As controls, mutants with other inactivated friulimicin biosynthesis genes (e.g., <i>lipD</i> and <i>pstA</i>) were fed; friulimicin was not produced (data not shown). Therefore, the complementation of mutants AF-O3N-10 and AF-O4-23 can be attributed to 2,3-diaminobutyric acid, which provides evidence for the involvement of <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i> in the synthesis of this nonproteinogenic amino acid.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The order of the enzyme reactions was analyzed in cosynthesis experiments by growing pairs of the various mutants parallel to each other on agar plates. Antibiotic production by the nonproducing mutants arising from cross feeding suggests that the biosynthetic intermediates can be secreted into the medium and taken up by other mutants to produce friulimicin. The <i>dabB</i> knockout mutant AF-O4-23 restored antibiotic production to the <i>dabA</i> (AF-O3-10) and <i>pip</i> (AF-Pip-32) knockout mutants. The <i>dabA</i> knockout mutant restored production only to the <i>pip</i> knockout mutant and not to the <i>dabB</i> knockout mutant. These results indicated that the <i>dabB</i> mutant is blocked at a later step of the reaction than the <i>dabA</i> mutant.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Regarding the in silico data and the experimental results for <i>dabA</i> and <i>dabB</i>, one can conclude that DabA, DabB, and DabC are involved in the synthesis of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. Since DabA has similarity to the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine synthases, a Î² replacement or elimination reaction may be engaged. For the synthesis mechanism of the structurally related compound 2,3-diaminopropionate in the viomycin biosynthetic pathway, the role of the cysteine synthase VioB in Î²-substituent replacement on <i>O</i>-acetyl-serine has been proposed previously (<a href=""#R46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R46"">46</a>). But the mechanism for 2,3-diaminobutyric acid synthesis must still be investigated.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Regulation, transport, resistance, synthesis, and linkage of the fatty acid component.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">At least four genes of the friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster show similarity to regulatory genes. RegC and RegD probably represent a two-component response regulatory system. RegA has similarity to the transcriptional activators of bialaphos biosynthesis, BrpA from <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> and PrpA from <i>Streptomyces viridochromogenes</i> (<a href=""#R31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R31"">31</a>, <a href=""#R38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R38"">38</a>). RegB is a SyrP-like protein (<a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>) and may be involved in a phosphorylation cascade.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>expA</i> and <i>expB</i> encode the two components of an ABC transporter. The genes encoding the two components of other ABC transporters in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes lie next to each other (<a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>). The <i>expA</i> and <i>expB</i> genes of <i>A. friuliensis</i>, in contrast, are separated by a number of other ORFs and are transcribed in opposite directions. The <i>mem</i> gene possibly encodes an integral membrane protein that functions in friulimicin transport.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Friulimicin probably inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by the complexing of the carrier undecaprenyl monophosphate in analogy to the mode of action of the structurally related antibiotic amphomycin (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R45"">45</a>). Since the target lies inside the cell, antibiotic efflux may be an important mechanism of self-resistance. We provided evidence for such a self-resistance mechanism involving <i>expA</i>, which encodes the transmembrane component of an ABC transporter. The <i>expA</i> gene under the control of the constitutive promoter <i>ermE*p</i> on plasmid pEM4ExpA was overexpressed in the friulimicin-sensitive strain <i>Streptomyces lividans</i> TK23. The MIC for <i>Streptomyces lividans</i> TK23 transformed with the vector pEM4 as a control was 1 to 5 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup>. In contrast, the MIC for <i>Streptomyces lividans</i> TK23 transformed with pEM4ExpA was 50 to 75 Î¼g ml<sup>â1</sup>. The increase in friulimicin resistance owing to <i>expA</i> expression was observed even though the ATP-binding domain of the corresponding ABC transporter was missing in the heterologous host. This means that ExpA must have nonspecifically interacted with another ATP-binding domain produced by <i>Streptomyces lividans</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The genes <i>lipA</i>, <i>lipB</i>, and <i>lipD</i> are likely to have a role in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of friulimicin. The deduced product of <i>lipA</i> has similarity to acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) ligases, exhibits the conserved AMP-binding domain motif, and therefore probably represents an acyl-AMP ligase. <i>lipD</i> encodes an acyl carrier protein. Equivalents of <i>lipA</i> and <i>lipD</i> are present in the gene cluster for the lipopeptide daptomycin (<a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>). In A54145 biosynthesis, these functions are fused by the fusion of the corresponding genes in the cluster (<a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>). The involvement of the <i>lipB</i> gene product, an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, in the formation of the Î<i>cis3</i> double bond in the acyl residue has previously been shown by insertional inactivation and heterologous expression of the gene (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). <i>lipE</i> encodes a protein belonging to the Î±,Î²-hydrolase family, which includes acyltransferases and thioesterases. Whether this enzyme is involved in an acyltransferase reaction, as predicted in the acylation model of friulimicin biosynthesis (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>), is not clear. A thioesterase type II function for the regeneration of misprimed NRPS is also possible (<a href=""#R39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R39"">39</a>). To date, an acyltransferase involved in such an antibiotic biosynthetic pathway has been found only for teicoplanin biosynthesis in <i>Actinoplanis teichomyceticus</i>, where it acylates the sugar moiety (<a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>). Acyltransferase genes have not been identified in other biosynthetic gene clusters, especially those for lipopeptides such as CDA, daptomycin, and surfactin (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>, <a href=""#R42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R42"">42</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The products of <i>orf7</i> (putative kinase), <i>orf12</i> (hypothetical protein), and <i>orf21</i> (MbtH-like family protein) have unknown functions. Among these genes, <i>orf21</i> represents a highly conserved gene with equivalents in many gene clusters corresponding to nonribosomally synthesized peptides (e.g., references <a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>, <a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>, <a href=""#R38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R38"">38</a>, <a href=""#R41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R41"">41</a>, <a href=""#R51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R51"">51</a>, and <a href=""#R53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R53"">53</a>).</div></section></section><div role=""paragraph"">

After the primary infection, HHV-7 becomes latent. HHV-7 contains two genes (U12 and U51) that encode putative homologs of cellular G-protein-coupled receptors. To analyze the biological function of the U12 gene, we cloned the gene and expressed the U12 protein in cells. The U12 gene encoded a calcium-mobilizing receptor for the EBI1 ligand chemokine-macrophage inflammatory protein 3Î² (ELC/MIP-3Î²) but not for other chemokines, suggesting that the chemokine selectivity of the U12 gene product is distinct from that of the known mammalian chemokine receptors. These studies revealed that U12 activates distinct transmembrane signaling pathways that may mediate biological functions by binding with a Î²-chemokine, ELC/MIP-3Î².</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div role=""paragraph"">Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was isolated in 1990 from a healthy individual whose cells were stimulated with an antibody against CD3 and then incubated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>). HHV-7 is a ubiquitous virus that is similar to HHV-6. The primary infection of HHV-7, like that of HHV-6, causes exanthem subitum or high fever, although the apparent infection rate seems to be very low (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>, <a href=""#R51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R51"">51</a>, <a href=""#R53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R53"">53</a>). The median age of children with primary HHV-7 infection is 26 months, significantly older than that of children with primary HHV-6 infection (median, 9 months) (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>, <a href=""#R48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R48"">48</a>).

HHV-7 is closely related to the T-lymphotropic betaherpesviruses, which share a common genomic organization and are composed of a single unique component that is bounded by direct repeats. HHV-7 is tropic for CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, uses the CD4<sup>+</sup> molecule as at least part of its receptor mechanism (<a href=""#R29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R29"">29</a>), and has an antagonistic effect on human immunodeficiency virus infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro (<a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Herpesviruses such as HHV-6, -7, and -8 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encode chemokine receptor homologs (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>, <a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>, <a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>, <a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>, <a href=""#R33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R33"">33</a>, <a href=""#R44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R44"">44</a>, <a href=""#R50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R50"">50</a>). HHV-7 encodes two G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologs (U12 and U51), which are the respective positional and structural homologs of HHV-6 U12 and U51 and of HCMV UL33 and UL78. The HHV-6 and HHV-7 U12 products show the closest sequence similarity to cellular GPCRs (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>). In humans, five CXC chemokine receptors, ten CC chemokine receptors, one C chemokine receptor, and one CX<sub>3</sub>C chemokine receptor have been identified, and their ligand specificities have been defined (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>, <a href=""#R11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R11"">11</a>, <a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>, <a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>, <a href=""#R28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R28"">28</a>, <a href=""#R32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R32"">32</a>, <a href=""#R34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R34"">34</a>-<a href=""#R36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R36"">36</a>, <a href=""#R39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R39"">39</a>-<a href=""#R43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R43"">43</a>, <a href=""#R45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R45"">45</a>, <a href=""#R46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R46"">46</a>, <a href=""#R49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R49"">49</a>, <a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>, <a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">To produce the ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> and SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> fusion proteins, 293/EBNA-1 cells were transfected with the expression vectors by using Lipofectamine (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described elsewhere (<a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>). ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> and SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> were expressed as soluble fusion proteins with a modified secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and six histidines at the C terminus. The transfected cells were incubated for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The conditioned medium was spun, filtered (0.45 Î¼m), and stored at 4Â°C with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.02% sodium azide. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on ProBond resin (Invitrogen). The SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> protein was also expressed and purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography on ProBond resin for use as a negative control in the binding assay. This SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> protein contains the complete signal peptide sequence at its N terminus. The concentrations of the ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> and SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> proteins were estimated by using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).

<div role=""paragraph"">K562 cells transfected with CCR1, CCR2B, CCR5, and CCR8 cells were used for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements. The cells were washed twice in HEPES-buffered Krebs solution (HBKS) as described previously (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>). Briefly, 10<sup>7</sup> cells were incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C in the dark in 1 ml of HBKS, which consisted of 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.24 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM indo-1 AM {1-[2-amino-5-(6-carboxy-2-indolyl)phenoxy]-2-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>â²,<i>N</i>â²-tetraacetic acid, pentaacetoxymethyl ester; Dojin Chemical Co.}.

<div role=""paragraph"">A simple and rapid analytical method for detecting interactions between ELC/MIP-3Î² and U12 was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> as the ligand was immobilized on a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip (Biacore). SPR was used to measure changes in the refractive index caused by the capability of the U12 expressed by the K562 cells to bind ELC/MIP-3Î². The sensor chips were activated with 500 Î¼M NiCl<sub>2</sub> and ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> was immobilized according to the manufacturer's instructions. ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> was immobilized at a concentration of 125 nM for 2 min at 25Â°C. Cells (10<sup>6</sup>) were suspended in 1 ml of running buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20 [pH 7.4]). K562 cells transfected with the parental pCEP4 vector alone, CCR7, and U12 were used as analytes, and binding to the ELC/MIP-3Î² immobilized on the chip was monitored in real time. The analysis of the interactions was carried out at a flow rate of 20 Î¼l/min at 25Â°C by using a Biacore 2000 system. Each sensorgram consists of an association phase (first 180 s), reflecting binding of the injected cells to the ELC/MIP-3Î², followed by a dissociation phase (260 s), during which the running buffer is passed over the chip and the bound cells are washed off the ELC/MIP-3Î² surface. The SPR signal was expressed in terms of resonance units. Data were globally analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-2""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>cDNA analysis and molecular cloning of the U12 gene.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We were interested in the 1,002-bp ORF U12, because the deduced amino acid sequence of the original predicted ORF U12 product had a high degree of similarity to the sequences of the chemokine receptors, including GPCRs. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the original predicted ORF U12 was shorter than that of HHV-6 U12. The primers 7U12-<i>Kpn</i>I and 7U12-<i>Bam</i>HI were designed to include a methionine site in a small ORF upstream of the original predicted U12 and the terminal site in the U12 gene, respectively. With these primers, the U12 coding region was amplified from cDNA that was synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer from total RNA purified from HHV-7-infected cells. Two bands of 1,092 and 1,002 bp and of approximately equal intensity were obtained (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1A</a>), and these DNAs were inserted into pCR2.1. The 1,002-bp band was not observed in the gel containing total RNA purified from HHV-7-infected cells without reverse transcriptase (RT) treatment (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1A</a>, lane 4) or in the gel containing DNA purified from infected cells with RT treatment (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1A</a>, lane 2). These results suggest that the virus-infected cells contained at least two species of mRNAs for U12 in approximately equal amounts. The nucleotide sequencing data from five clones for each band showed that 1,092- and 1,002-bp bands were amplified from unspliced RNA or genomic DNA and spliced mRNA, respectively. From the positions of consensus splice donor and acceptor sites, it appears that the shorter mRNA was generated from two exons after a 90-nucleotide intron was spliced out (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1A</a> and <a href=""#F2"">2</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We then analyzed U12 expression by Northern blot analysis using total RNA prepared from HHV-7-infected or uninfected SupT1 cells. As shown in Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1B</a>, U12 was highly expressed in the infected cells.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Amino acid sequence homology with human CCR7.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The N-terminal extracellular domain of the U12 product contained a potential N-glycosylation site, as do most known GPCRs. All the extracellular domains of the U12 product contained four highly conserved cysteine residues that are essential to the structure of GPCRs (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). The cDNA contained introns, a feature of most chemokine receptor genes (<a href=""#R30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R30"">30</a>), and its sequence was identical to the genomic sequence. The resultant 1,002 nucleotides of coding region could be translated into a 334-amino-acid polypeptide encoding a GPCR homolog (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). Since, as described above, there are counterparts of this gene in the HHV-7 and human genomes, we compared the amino acid sequence with human chemokine receptors. U12 also exhibited homology to multiple mammalian GPCRs; the highest was to EBI1/CCR7. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 22% homology to human CCR7 (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). Sequence alignment of the U12 product with the EBI1/CCR7 product suggested that HHV-7 U12 contained seven transmembrane regions, four extracellular domains, and four cytoplasmic domains (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Expression of U12-GFP.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We used fluorescence microscopy to confirm the expression of U12-GFP in each experiment (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4A</a>). A schematic drawing of the section planes is given in Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4B</a>. A U12-GFP-tagged expression vector was utilized in this experiment because the U12 polyclonal antiserum was not very reactive in Western blot analyses or immunofluorescence assays. The GFP vector, pEGFP-N1, alone was a control in this experiment. GFP expression was localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4A</a>, panels a and b) in the control, and the U12-GFP product seemed to be detected on the membrane, given that fluorescence was detected as dots throughout the cells (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4B, panels c and d</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Signaling through the U12 GPCR in response to ELC/MIP-3Î².</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To test whether the U12 product is capable of signal transduction, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were monitored by measuring the relative fluorescence of indo-1-loaded cells stimulated with ELC/MIP-3Î², RANTES, I-309, MIP-1Î², and IL-8, as described previously (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>) (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5</a>). To confirm the positive signaling by a specific ligand and receptor, we used as positive control cells expressing CXCR1, CCR5, CCR8, and CCR1, which responded to IL-8, MIP1-Î², I-309, and RANTES, respectively (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5B</a>). Untransfected and pCEP4-transfected K562 cells did not respond to any of the chemokines tested (data not shown). K562 cells transfected with U12 responded to ELC/MIP-3Î² but not to the other cytokines (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5A</a>). Treatment with buffer alone did not induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in parental K562 cells or K562 cells transfected with CCR1, CCR8, CCR5, or CXCR1 (data not shown). Treatment of U12 gene transfectants with ELC/MIP-3Î² induced transient elevations of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, with a 50% effective concentration of about 30 nM (Fig. <a href=""#F6"">6</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Binding of ELC/MIP-3Î² to U12.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> was secreted as a single major protein with an expected apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7A</a>). This fusion protein has an alkaline phosphatase activity for quantitative tracing and a His<sub>6</sub> tag in its COOH terminus for easy purification and for fixing to the Biacore NTA sensor chip.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">By using real-time biospecific interaction analysis (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden), we studied the binding affinity of the U12 (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7B</a>). To test whether the U12 product functions as a chemokine receptor, we examined the binding activity of the U12 product with ELC/MIP-3Î² (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7B</a>). Stable K562 cell lines expressing pCEP4, EBI1/CCR7, or U12 were used for this assay. The U12-transfected K562 cells expressed specific binding sites for ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub>, whereas the pCEP4-transfected K562 cells did not. A typical profile of binding of ELC/MIP-3Î²-SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> to U12-transfected cells is shown in Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7B</a>. The K562 cells transfected with pCEP4, EBI1/CCR7, and U12 bound with relatively equal affinity to SEAP-His<sub>6</sub> (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7B</a>). Under the same experimental conditions, SEAP-His<sub>6</sub>, used here as a negative control, did not show binding of U12 to ELC/MIP-3Î² (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7B</a>).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">In this paper, we report that the U12 gene of HHV-7 encodes a chemokine receptor that was expressed in HHV-7 infected SupT1 cells, and we characterize the U12 protein. The U12 gene is a 1.8-kb RNA and encodes a protein of 334 amino acid residues that has seven transmembrane domains and a highly conserved GPCR motif at the junction of the third transmembrane domain and second intracellular loop (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a> and <a href=""#F3"">3</a>) (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of HHV-7 U12 was 19 amino acids shorter than that of HHV-6 U12 (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>). Homology searches showed that the U12 sequence was 22% identical to that of EBI1/CCR7 (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). The U12 receptor was capable of transducing a chemokine signal from ELC/MIP-3Î² to the cytoplasm that resulted in a transient elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, with a 50% effective concentration of 30 nM (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5</a> and <a href=""#F6"">6</a>). Its signal transduction response was similar to that of EBI1/CCR7 (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5</a>). U12 is notable in that of the &gt;10 purified chemokines tested, the U12 protein appeared to interact only with ELC/MIP-3Î². ELC/MIP-3Î² shows homologies to other CC chemokines with 20 to 30% identity (<a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>). ELC/MIP-3Î² is constitutively expressed in various lymphoid tissues, including the thymus, lymph nodes, appendix, and spleen (<a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>, <a href=""#R55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R55"">55</a>). Collectively, these results show that ELC/MIP-3Î² is a specific high-affinity biological ligand for U12. The present studies strongly suggest that HHV-7-infected cells respond to ELC/MIP-3Î² via U12.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The EBI1/CCR7 gene was first reported by Birkenbach et al. (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>) as a lymphocyte-specific GPCR induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBI1/CCR7 is specific for ELC/MIP-3Î² and secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (<a href=""#R31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R31"">31</a>, <a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>) and acts to moderate cell migration and proliferation. Furthermore, Hasegawa et al. showed that the EBI1/CCR7 gene was induced not only by EBV but also by HHV-6 and -7 infection in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Because EBI1/CCR7 is constitutively expressed in various lymphoid tissues and on activated T and B lymphocytes (<a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>-<a href=""#R57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R57"">57</a>), ELC/MIP-3Î² and EBI1/CCR7 may play roles not only in inflammatory and immunological responses but also in normal lymphocyte recirculation and homing. Most CC chemokines are potent attractants of monocytes and are known to act via shared receptors (<a href=""#R20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R20"">20</a>, <a href=""#R45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R45"">45</a>). Genes for EBI1/CCR7 and EBI2, designated EBV-induced genes 1 and 2, were isolated through their strong up-regulation in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells upon infection with EBV (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>). Similarly, BLR1 and BLR2, designated as Burkitt's lymphoma virus receptors 1 and 2, were isolated through their induction by EBV infection (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>, <a href=""#R46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R46"">46</a>). BLR2, which is identical to EBI1/CCR7, was further shown to be induced by the EBV-encoded transactivator EBNA-2 (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>). BLR1 and EBI1/CCR7 are most homologous to the chemokine receptors, whereas EBI2 is most related to the thrombin receptor. Furthermore, herpesviruses such as HCMV (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>, <a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>, <a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>), herpesvirus saimiri (<a href=""#R38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R38"">38</a>), HHV-6 (<a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>, <a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>), HHV-7 (<a href=""#R37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R37"">37</a>), and HHV-8/Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (<a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>) are all known to encode GPCRs that are homologous to chemokine receptors. A chemokine receptor encoded by HHV-8 was found to be constitutively active and to stimulate the proliferation of transfected cells, making it a candidate viral oncogene (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Taken together, these results suggest that virally encoded putative chemokine receptors play important roles in the infection and life cycle of herpesviruses, especially in vivo. The roles of ELC/MIP-3Î² and U12 in HHV-7-infected T cells are not known at present, but they may have biological activities in infected cells, such as promoting growth, protecting cells from apoptosis, and/or directing migration into specific anatomical locations in vivo. The identification of ELC/MIP-3Î² as a specific ligand for U12 now enables us to examine the possible roles of ELC/MIP-3Î² and U12 in the infection process and life cycle of HHV-7. Such studies may lead to new strategies to prevent herpesvirus infection. Further studies exploring the function of U12 in vivo may provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis and latency of HHV-7 infection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, this paper reports the first characterization of HHV-7 U12, as signaling the GPCR. This result was expected, given the properties of HHV-6 U12, but this still represents the first description of this molecule. The most interesting result is the identification of the U12 ligand. The significance of these results stems from the possibility that a signaling receptor may well contribute to pathogenesis.</div></section><div role=""paragraph"">

<div role=""paragraph"">We are very pleased that our paper has stirred so much thought and attention.

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01966-21","<div role=""paragraph"">In the struggle with antibiotic resistance, we are losing. There is now a serious threat of moving into a postantibiotic world. High levels of resistance, in terms of both frequency and strength, have evolved against all clinically approved antibiotics worldwide. The usable life span of new clinically approved antibiotics is typically less than a decade before resistance reaches frequencies so high as to require only guarded usage. However, microbes have produced antibiotics for millennia without resistance becoming an existential issue. If resistance is the inevitable consequence of antibiotic usage, as has been the human experience, why has it not become an issue for microbes as well, especially since resistance genes are as prevalent in nature as the genes responsible for antibiotic production? Here, we ask how antibiotics can exist given the almost ubiquitous presence of resistance genes in the very microbes that have produced and used antibiotics since before humans walked the planet. We find that the context of both production and usage of antibiotics by microbes may be key to understanding how resistance is managed over time, with antibiotic synthesis and resistance existing in a paired relationship, much like a cipher and key, that impacts microbial community assembly. Finally, we put forward the cohesive, ecologically based âsecret societyâ hypothesis to explain the longevity of antibiotics in nature.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div class=""core-pseudoheading"" data-style-of=""h2"">INTRODUCTION</div>
<section id=""sec-2""><h2>WHY DO ANTIBIOTICS EXIST IN NATURE?</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The majority of developed antibiotics owe their existence to microbes. Antibiotics likely have been part of the microbial world for millions of years (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). But from the time they were discovered by humans and put into clinical use, we consistently see resistance evolve to high frequencies in short periods of time, typically within a decade or so (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). Resistance is often to such a high degree, in terms of frequency and level, that the antibiotic becomes effectively useless for chemotherapeutic purposes. Given these two very different outcomes, we must consider why antibiotic use has not led to resistance in natural microbial usage as it so reliably has for humans.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig1"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The fact that all human use of antibiotics has led to antibiotic resistance implies that resistance may be inevitable. This outcome is not surprising given the intense selection for resistance in antibiotic-laden environments. But, if resistance is inevitable, why did resistance to all naturally occurring antibiotics not evolve and eliminate the possibility of miracle drugs long before the discovery of penicillin almost a century ago? Do microbes just manage antibiotics better, or is there something intrinsic about microbial use of these compounds that sustains their applicability? Why has resistance to even the oldest forms of naturally occurring antibiotics not reached fixation? Surely, enough time has elapsed for this possibility to occur. What do microbes and humans do differently? In short, we need to ask ourselves: why do antibiotics exist at all? Here, we review the current state of knowledge concerning antibiotic use and effect in both natural and human-controlled systems to better understand the role of antibiotics in the ecology and evolution of microbes past and present.</div></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>THE ORIGIN OF ANTIBIOTICS AND THE ANTIBIOTIC ORIGIN STORY</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The cornerstone of modern medicine was laid in the 1890s when Paul Ehrlich, working with <i>in vivo</i> stains, developed the idea of pairing stain-like compounds capable of entering cells with toxins that could kill it. Ehrlichâs work led to the development of salvarsan, the worldâs first antibacterial (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Dyes continued to be a focus in the new field of âchemiotherapy.â In 1935, Gerhard Domagk showed that prontosil, a red dye, was effective against streptococcal infections (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>), making it the first sulfa drug (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Prontosil was also highly effective against puerperal fever, most associated with deaths in women following childbirth (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). Sulfa drugs suffered from negative side effects and were used with limited success in the mid-twentieth century, particularly during World War II (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-4""><h2>ANTIBIOTICS</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Salvarsan and prontosil were the flagship drugs of the first two classes of antimicrobial chemotherapy. But while bactericidal, they were both synthetic and not naturally occurring biomolecules. The first true antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. Flemingâs observation that a fungus, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Penicillium notatum</span>, inhibited the growth of staphylococci on agar medium led to the isolation and identification of what became known as penicillin.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Contrary to how we think of penicillin today, medicine was not revolutionized overnight, even though Fleming published his findings immediately (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). Rather, Fleming found that cultivating the fungus was difficult and that purifying penicillin was problematic. As such, what would later be called the miracle drug was not well known until the problem of production was taken up by Ernst Boris Chain, Howard Florey, Norman Heatley, and Edward Abraham. The work of these chemists led to the isolation and purification of penicillin along with techniques to efficiently prepare solutions that could then be administered to patients (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). Another milestone in the development of penicillin occurred when another fungal strain, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Penicillium chrysogenum</span>, which produced many times more penicillin than Flemingâs strain, was isolated from moldy fruit by Mary Hunt at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Illinois (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Clinical use of penicillin began in 1940, but the worldâs first true antibiotic was largely ineffective against many infectious diseases because penicillin works only against Gram-positive bacteria (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). Treatment of Gram-negative bacteria would wait for the next major advancement in infectious disease control, which came when streptomycin was discovered in the lab of Selman Waksman at Rutgers University in 1943 (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-5""><h2>RISE OF RESISTANCE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The first antibiotic resistance described in published reports was to penicillin, in 1940 (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). Streptomycin resistance was reported in the first randomized controlled clinical trial for a drug in 1948 (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). In fact, resistance to all known antibiotics (whether natural or synthetic) followed quickly after clinical or industrial use of the drug (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). The typical response was to identify and develop new antibiotics to replace older classes, leading to what has been called the golden age of antibiotics in the 1950s and 1960s (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). However, the pipeline of new, easily identified antibiotics was quickly exhausted (reviewed in reference <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>), leading to a lack of available treatment options by the 1970s that continues today. Some programs, such as the 10 Ã â20 initiative (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), have added newly approved antibiotics, but this trend seems likely to be short-lived (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There are two major reasons for the decline in new antibiotics over the past half-century: greater difficulty in identifying new classes of drugs (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>) and the skyrocketing costs of development. The cost of bringing a new drug to market is estimated to be over $3.12 billion (converted from 2013 dollars) (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). With such an investment required, pharmaceutical companies have little financial interest in developing low-profit, short-treatment-duration medicines such as antibiotics. Financial concerns are further magnified given that the life expectancy of these new and expensive products has consistently been limited to less than a decade of clinical use due to antibiotic-resistant strains rising to high frequency within that time (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In reaction to the antibiotic resistance problem and with treatment options dwindling, public health officials attempted to control antibiotic usage as a means of controlling resistance (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). The expectation was that rates of resistance would diminish as antibiotic usage dropped. However, resistance persisted even in the face of such drug management practices on both small and large scales (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21 B22"">â</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). This failed approach for controlling the evolution of resistance by limiting usage was aptly named âthe ecological fallacyâ (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This fallacy is based upon a simplified view of evolution in which fitness gains due to antibiotic resistance are offset by fitness costs to bearers of resistance phenotypes due to reduced performance in other aspects of their biology, i.e., trade-offs. The flaw in this reasoning is the assumption that the absence of an antibiotic from the environment has the same level of impact as, but opposite effect of, its presence. We have learned that reversion to sensitivity is neither an immediate nor necessary outcome of selection simply because a resistant pathogen is no longer in an antibiotic-laden environment (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). The reasons for this relate to the lasting impact of antibiotic treatment upon microbes as well as changes at the genetic level that reconfigure the fitness landscape for resistant populations and make reversion less likely (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">â</a><a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). In essence, the presence of clinical concentrations of antibiotics more strongly selects for resistance than the absence of antibiotics selects for reversion to antibiotic sensitivity.</div></section><section id=""sec-6""><h2>THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESISTOME</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbes are among the oldest extant organisms and during their billions of years of existence have come into close contact with toxic molecules of all types. Microbial genomics has provided a wealth of data indicating that most bacterial genomes have genes that allow them to become resistant to one or more antibiotics. These data have led to the development of the concept of an âantibiotic resistome,â which includes all antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their precursors in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Notably, ARGs exist in all ecological niches that harbor microbial communities. These findings reinforce the essential role that antibiotics and other toxic substances have played in bacterial evolution and strongly suggest that resistance to antibiotics has coevolved along with antibiotic biosynthesis (reviewed in reference <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). The metagenomic analysis of ancient DNA shows clearly that antibiotic resistance is a natural mechanism that predates the use of antibiotics as therapeutic drugs (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Soil bacteria play an essential role in the production of antibiotics and provide deep insight into the capacity to inactivate them. For instance, the genome of soil actinomycetes contains more than 20 biosynthetic gene clusters for diverse bioactive compounds and ARGs (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). In addition, there are soil bacteria that can use antibiotics as their sole carbon source (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). A deep understanding of the functional role of both antibiotic biosynthesis and ARGs in the environment can shed light onto how to address the future use of antibiotics to fight bacterial infections.</div></section><section id=""sec-7""><h2>NATURAL RESISTANCE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Retrospective investigations into the existence of resistance in the time before the introduction of penicillin (the preantibiotic era [<a href=""#O1"">Box 1</a>]) indicate that ARGs were not only present but also common in a wide range of bacterial species (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), particularly on plasmids (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>, <a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). While the number of such preantibiotic-era studies is limited, we see that resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics was common (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), with more than one ARG existing for natural antibiotics such as penicillin (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). The number and diversity of ARGs in the preantibiotic era are much greater than expected, and plasmids carrying these genes have long been horizontally transferred within and between species (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). These data suggest that antibiotic resistance has been in existence for as long as antibiotics themselves (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Why then did widespread antibiotic resistance never arise and sweep to fixation over the millions of years of consistent use by microbes, though it so reliably and irreversibly evolves in treatment for modern pathogens?</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""O1"" class=""boxed-text""></figure>
</div></section><section id=""sec-8""><h2>HOW ARE ANTIBIOTICS USED IN NATURE?</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">In nature, antibiotics are employed in a very different way than they are in clinical treatment. Most glaringly, antibiotics are not produced in such high concentrations, for such long durations, or at such large scales. In the clinic, antibiotics are used to kill all susceptible bacteria; any outside consequences of that use are ancillary. As such, the differences in the application of antibiotics between microbes and the clinic should be carefully considered, as these differences suggest that their effects may also differ.</div></section><section id=""sec-9""><h2>CONCENTRATION, DURATION, AND SCALE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Clinical use of antibiotics in humans is centered upon concentrated delivery of the compound over time. This usage directly ties concentration and duration together in a fundamental way. Clinically effective doses of antibiotics are identified using pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD [<a href=""#O2"">Box 2</a>]). Dosing of an antibiotic to cure an infectious disease is a determined function of the peak concentration of antibiotic (a proxy of bacterium-killing power) and the efficacy of a delivered dose over time, usually 24âh (a proxy measure of chemical stamina <i>in situ</i>) (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). Put simply, the measured ability of a single dose of an antibiotic to kill bacteria and persist at detectable concentrations is optimized by PK/PD for clinical use against a bacterial strain of specified susceptibility. If low-level resistance is found in a strain, higher peak and residual concentrations over the specified time are used (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""O2"" class=""boxed-text""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">PK/PD curves must be determined for humans and animals, since biologically active hosts will metabolize and excrete the antibiotic (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). This degradation reduces the total drug present over time, with the entire host environment capable of metabolizing the drug. Contrast this with natural environments where antibiotic concentrations will be more variable over time. Clearly there will be no PK/PD-like optimization and, in an environment such as soil, metabolic degradation will be more transient than would be the case in animal tissue. As a result, antibiotics in natural environments, such as soil, may linger for much longer periods of time than in clinical use. Experimental data support this conclusion (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>), showing that antibiotics in soil, water, and even plants seem to persist over longer periods of time before they are degraded by biotic and abiotic reactions, mostly by microbial populations (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). But the ability of microbes to degrade environmental antibiotics suggests that this process is heavily dependent upon the type and size of microbial communities present, as well as abiotic conditions such as temperature, moisture, and pH (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Given the reliance on such diverse (and uncontrolled) variables in the environment, antibiotic degradation is decidedly slow and heterogeneous. The most likely result is longer antibiotic residence time in the environment.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Concentration, however, is a different issue. There are no consistent data on natural antibiotic concentrations in the environment (reviewed in reference <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), but concentrations are reasonably suspected to be much lower than those used in the clinic (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). For a compound to be functional as an antibiotic, i.e., either bactericidal or bacteriostatic, concentrations in nature must meet or exceed the MIC for the target species/strain. Often, the MIC can be extremely low (&lt;0.016âmg/L or &lt;0.016âng/Î¼L) (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Such concentrations should be achievable in naturally growing populations, although likely over only limited distances. The result is that a single microbe can produce a small amount of an antimicrobial compound that raises the concentrations to or above MICs in the microliter-sized space around that particular cell. As many cells within the population produce the antibiotic, the concentration in the volumetric space around that population increases.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nonetheless, concentrations of antibiotics in naturally occurring populations are not likely to approach even the same order of magnitude as in the clinic (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Consider streptomycin: in patients with tuberculosis, target serum concentrations are often about 40âÎ¼g/mL (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), or 160Ã higher than the measured MIC for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>) (and 2,500Ã higher than an MIC of 0.016âmg/L). This difference in concentration represents a drastic change in the magnitude of selection, with all low-level-resistant mutants being impacted in the same way and to the same degree as completely sensitive wild-type clones.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The conclusion is that concentrations of naturally occurring antibiotic compounds, and their effects, are orders of magnitude lower than those used in the clinic. In addition, the time in which antibiotics remain in natural environments is different than in human patients (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Pharmacodynamics not only optimizes peak concentrations but also sets lower limits below which serum concentration should not fall. This lower limit is often associated with the measured MIC for the pathogen. Any time spent below this level is implicated in selection for resistance mutations, such as in the mutant selection window hypothesis (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). Therefore, from an evolutionary perspective, the way we use antibiotics is central to the current problem of antibiotic resistance and may be crucial to understanding how microbes have been able to employ antibiotics over long periods. In the natural situation described, a concentration gradient exists in space, with higher concentrations closer to the source and lower concentrations further away (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). In the clinical picture, the concentration gradient exists in time, with values during treatment in a constant, cyclical, and controlled flux. In addition, antibiotic concentrations are roughly the same everywhere within the host at any given time. The important distinction between these two lies in the possible responses: a physical gradient can be tolerated through movement, perhaps even small ones. In contrast, a temporal flux, particularly at the concentrations considered, becomes an existential condition, necessarily impacting the ability to survive, and with it, the strength and direction of selection.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig2"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Similarly, it has been shown that combinations of antibiotics can enhance or diminish bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>, <a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), suggesting that clinical-level concentrations are not the only way of ensuring population-level effects upon microbes. This range of combinatorial effects adds depth to the number of possible outcomes in a localized environment as synergistic effects of antibiotics can both lower the probability of evolving resistance and expand the mutant selection window via antagonistic interactions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The last of our immediate considerations is that of scale. The limited concentration and unknown duration of antibiotic compounds in natural environments contrast with the consistently high concentrations called for by PK/PD. Additionally, the impact of human use of antibiotics is global, in all senses of the word.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Within patients, antibiotics are distributed by design throughout the body. Ease of infection site delivery has always been a key advantage of antibiotics. Patients are treated with antibiotics orally, intravenously, rectally, or via injection, with circulatory systems facilitating transport to infected areas. This effortlessness is due in large part to the small size of antibiotic molecules and the fact that they have little cross-reactivity with molecules outside the target species (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Contrast this with the complications of infection site delivery associated with other approaches, such as phage therapy (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>, <a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). The combination of the ease of delivery with the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat large groups of suspected (but not necessarily identified) pathogens results in the within-patient ubiquity of antibiotics upon which we have come to rely.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">On a larger scale, since 1940, antibiotics have become an omnipresent pollutant in environments of all types (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>). Even in places largely untouched by humans, we can find antibiotic compounds and, with them, ARGs (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a><a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57 B58"">â</a><a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). In recent years, we have learned that even low levels of antibiotic pollution select for high levels of resistance (<a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a><a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">â</a><a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>). Additionally, regardless of the biome or their ability to clear pollutants, humanityâs worldwide industrial-level use of antibiotics has resulted in a steady stream of antibiotics into the environment, without ever allowing natural systems to return to baseline levels (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The result of humanityâs overproduction and misuse of antibiotics, including their massive presence in agriculture and animal husbandry (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a><a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">â</a><a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>), is the transformation of a natural product used in limited scope within microbial communities into a biological weapon of mass destruction dispatched against microbial communities of all types in all places. This abuse is on the same scale as nuclear weapons testing, another misused mid-twentieth century technology (<a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>). Although the expected duration of antibiotic contamination is thought to be significantly shorter than that of nuclear fallout (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>), the long-term impact upon microbial communities and the genetic changes necessarily imposed by selection for resistance through contamination of the environment is beyond calculation. (Interestingly, although the timeline of nuclear fallout and its impact is much longer than that of antibiotic pollution in the environment, antibiotic pollution has already lasted longer in terms of generations for microbes. Radionuclides resulting from test explosions, such as plutonium-239 [half-life, 24,000 years], degrade on a scale of approximately 1,000 human generations. Even if we require several half-lives to have passed in order to accept a lower nuclear pollution level, that time is still dwarfed by the number of microbial generations that have passed since the industrial production of antibiotics started in 1942.)</div></section><section id=""sec-10""><h2>SIGNALING</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">If the concentration, duration, and scale of antibiotic use in nature are so vastly different from clinical use, the question of what need antibiotics evolved to meet remains. What is the role of antibiotics in natural environments? Potential answers to this question are few, but one hypothesis that has gained considerable support is that antibiotics function as a signaling molecules in microbial environments (<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a><a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">â</a><a href=""#B71"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B71"">71</a>). The observation that low concentrations of antibiotic compounds can act as transcriptional regulators has become integral to our understanding of interspecific dynamics in natural microbial communities (<a href=""#B72"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B72"">72</a>, <a href=""#B73"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B73"">73</a>). The transcriptional changes induced by antibiotic compounds range widely from species to species and compound to compound; however, many of the genes upregulated are implicated in stress response or biofilm-associated phenotypes, suggesting that the use of antibiotics in nature differs from their presumed role as weapons of microbial warfare. In fact, we argue that this presumption cannot be correct.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Consider how antibiotics are dispersed through space in a natural medium, such as soil. Microbial cells produce and excrete the antibiotic into the space around them. The concentration is highest at the source and drops with distance from the producer cells. The result is a zone of inhibition, the phenomenon Fleming first observed in 1928. A standardized paper disk or Kirby-Bauer test (<a href=""#B74"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B74"">74</a>) is based upon the principle that the outer circumference of the zone of inhibition is directly related to the MIC for the bacterial strain tested, meaning that at the outer edge, the concentration of the antibiotic being tested is high enough to stop growth. However, the diffusion of the antibiotic can reasonably be expected to continue past the outer ring of the inhibition zone (disregarding any metabolic inactivation) and should continue to decrease over space, potentially affecting transcription in the bacterial cells present in this space (<a href=""#B75"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B75"">75</a>). Contrast this with the PK/PD approach, where the goal is to maintain high serum concentrations in the entire volume over a specified time. Hormesis and the totality of antibiotic effects upon microbial populations are still not well understood (<a href=""#B76"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B76"">76</a>). Combinations of antibiotics can also shift the effects of antibiotic compounds in an environment (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>), suggesting that the lower concentrations found in nature might have oversized effects upon bacterial populations based on the totality of compounds present. Such synergistic or antagonistic effects may also inform hypotheses as to why microbes produce and excrete both bacteriostatic and bactericidal compounds, as well as offering a hypothesis underlying observations of antagonism between these different types of compounds, particularly at microbial scales (<a href=""#B77"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B77"">77</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition, the range of natural environments in animal hosts for microbes is large. Consider, for example, the different environments possible for âgut microbiomes.â In each of those, different bacterial communities with specific functional requirements will coexist. Furthermore, the impact of antibiotics on such communities (and their residual influence on host health) are vital to a complete understanding of the effect of antibiotics and resistance in natural microbial environments (<a href=""#B78"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B78"">78</a>). Clearly, the use of antibiotics in natural environments has more to teach us about how and why these compounds have been in use for eons, forcing us to re-evaluate our assumption that the sole purpose of antibiotics lies in antagonism.</div></section><section id=""sec-11""><h2>REINTERPRETING ANTIBIOTICS WITH NATURE AS OUR ROSETTA STONE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Clinical use of antibiotics is rooted in the assumption that species producing a particular antibiotic do so for the purposes of directly competing against other species or strains in the natural environment. This presumption is the same as that which underlies antibiotic use by humans; antibiotics are armaments of antagonism, produced by one microbe and meant to hinder another.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Interestingly, humans depart from this supposition more than we adhere to it: clinical therapeutics is not the largest use of antibiotics and has not been for some time. In the 1940s, it was observed that livestock more efficiently achieved market size when given low doses of antibiotics (<a href=""#B79"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B79"">79</a>, <a href=""#B80"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B80"">80</a>). While hypotheses for this observation exist (<a href=""#B81"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B81"">81</a>), a complete explanation has not yet been deciphered. Nonetheless, we continue to use most industrially produced antibiotics not for microbial antagonism <i>per se</i> but rather for faster animal growth, without regard for the mode of action or its consequences.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Given humanityâs incomplete and inconsistent consideration of antibiotics, their application, and their purpose, a more complete analysis of their use under conditions shaped by evolutionary and ecological forces is warranted, particularly given the long success microbes have had using antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, managing antibiotic resistance.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">First and foremost, we note that, in nature, synthesis of and resistance to antibiotics are intimately connected. Studies of naturally occurring resistance indicate that an ARG is often linked with the genes involved in biosynthesis of that antibiotic (<a href=""#B82"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B82"">82</a>). This association is confirmed in samples representing preantibiotic-era strains as well as those from pristine environments, with many of the antibiotic-resistance pairs encoded in phylogenetically related groups (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). The consistent pairing of antibiotic production with ARGs within monophyletic groups, coupled with such production-resistance pairings on mobile plasmids (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), strongly suggests that this connection signals a longstanding fundamental characteristic of antibiotic use in nature.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Phylogenetic ties between strains and groups are also supported by ecological interactions between and within these groups. More often than expected by a null model, microbial communities are made up of phylogenetically related interacting species (<a href=""#B83"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B83"">83</a>, <a href=""#B84"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B84"">84</a>). The hypothesis underlying this observation is that abiotic variables in the environment filter community members and more closely related species are more likely to have similar niches (<a href=""#B84"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B84"">84</a>, <a href=""#B85"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B85"">85</a>). We propose another possible hypothesis for this observation: community assembly is governed by biotic or, perhaps more properly, antibiotic filters as much as abiotic filters. This hypothesis explains the phylogenetic clustering observed in microbial communities across a large array of environments, as well as the consistency of groupings at the family taxonomic level observed in communities (<a href=""#B83"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B83"">83</a>). Additionally, the existence of such mutualisms would also provide an explanation for the observations of antibiotic resistance arising as an emergent phenomenon within some communities as a result of cooperative action rather than from the biochemical processes within single cells (<a href=""#B86"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B86"">86</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">As communities grow, distinct pairings that represent symbiotic interactions are often vital. It is beneficial for a species present to filter the pool of possible neighbors with which they will interact so as to increase the likelihood that a beneficial partner will be present, particularly when limited carbon resources are likely to be utilized by more than one member of the community (<a href=""#B87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B87"">87</a>). By producing and secreting a given antibiotic into the space around the producerâs position, a species may not be so much trying to impair competitors as to reserve space for proven partners. Experimental evidence of community construction based upon interactions in which antibiotics play a role has been observed (<a href=""#B88"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B88"">88</a>, <a href=""#B89"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B89"">89</a>). Neighbors thus selected will need to be antibiotic resistant, which may also be more probable if they are also phylogenetically related to the producer. In addition, because of the pairing of antibiotic production genes with ARGs, the resistant neighbor is also more likely to be able to produce the same antibiotic compound, thereby reinforcing the screening effect and reserving even more space for the mutualistic pair to then grow into and/or control. Such a dynamic would indicate that resistance is precisely the mechanism that makes antibiotics valuable in natural microbial communities. Further, multimember community action is implicated as combinations of antibiotic-classes present can enhance or antagonize the effects of an antibiotic overall (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), leading to additional community-level filtering capacity.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The implication that natural antibiotic production and resistance should be intimately tied together can be contrasted with the presumption that antibiotics are a weapon of microbial warfare. In the combat framework, antibiotic production is beneficial, with the ability to produce more being better (akin to the PK/PD approach). This dynamic implies the strong potential for an evolutionary arms race. However, this system seems never to have dwelled in the realm of the red queen: hyperproducers (on the scale of clinical concentrations) are not known, nor are high levels of resistance. The strain of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. chrysogenum</span> that Mary Hunt isolated from a rotting cantaloupe was a hyperproducer of penicillin, but artificial selection and X-ray mutagenesis experiments yielded even higher-producing mutants (<a href=""#B90"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B90"">90</a>), suggesting that such a mutational path was possible via one or a few mutational steps but not likely to have ever been beneficial to fitness.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition, investigations into the evolution and long-term application of antibiotics as weapons of microbial warfare suggest that the microbial armory is large and diverse (<a href=""#B91"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B91"">91</a>) but that evolutionary strategies that employ competition and antagonism ultimately need to be tightly controlled (<a href=""#B92"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B92"">92</a>). Control is ultimately both costly and complex (<a href=""#B92"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B92"">92</a>), particularly when eukaryotes are also considered (<a href=""#B93"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B93"">93</a>). The cost of control mechanisms, along with their near-ubiquity across microbial species (<a href=""#B92"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B92"">92</a>), suggest that a large-scale evolutionary arms race(s) was limited, even though the number and types of microbial âweaponsâ continued to diversify. A slightly different approach, and one that is in line with evolutionary game theory (<a href=""#B94"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B94"">94</a>), is that even limited cooperation can be less costly over the number of interactions likely as well as over the evolutionary time scales involved. Consider that clinically relevant antibiotic resistance of the kind common today is known to be costly to fitness overall, making both sides of this evolutionary war game losing strategies without a consistent and strong offsetting force. Any breakdown of such a compensating tension would likely lead to antibiotics rapidly losing all potential benefit and being selected against by natural selection, followed by costly ARGs (although this argument runs dangerously close to replaying the ecological fallacy). Pairing these phenotypes, however, creates a balanced approach that can be maintained via selection by the constant need for community assembly across many environments over vast evolutionary timescales.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Even strains that are not resistant to a particular antibiotic may be influenced by low concentrations of the compound through transcriptional changes and gene regulation (<a href=""#B95"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B95"">95</a>, <a href=""#B96"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B96"">96</a>). Genes that are transcriptionally impacted could possibly make the species more likely to cooperate with the antibiotic producer or, alternatively, less likely to invade the producerâs space (edge-specialist bacteria?). Such suppositions are amenable to experimental inquiry and offer one potential line of hypothesis testing and/or development.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This cooperative effect would presumably be greatest just beyond the outer edge of a zone of inhibition, where concentrations are lower, suggesting a kind of secret âfriend or foe?â inquiry being put to a potential neighbor by the producer prior to any direct interaction. Similar systems are known to exist in quorum sensing feedbacks in species such as <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Clostridioides</span> (formerly <i>Clostridium</i>) <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">difficile</span> (<a href=""#B97"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B97"">97</a>), suggesting that nonconstitutive phenotypes can be induced based upon biointeractions with adjoining bacterial cells. Given the metabolic and fitness costs associated with antibiotic production, it is not surprising that researchers are also finding antibiotic synthesis linked to quorum sensing in cocultures (<a href=""#B98"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B98"">98</a>, <a href=""#B99"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B99"">99</a>), particularly as a mechanism to limit social cheaters (<a href=""#B100"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B100"">100</a>), suggesting that a main outcome of these interactions is related to community building and stability (<a href=""#B101"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B101"">101</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This âsecret societyâ hypothesis, where known members are trusted, new members undergo hazing-like phenotype acquisition, and potential newcomers are continuously recruited, also provides a potential explanation for why ARGs in the clinic are often associated with plasmids. Preantibiotic-era plasmids often maintained a producer-resistance pairing. This may have been beneficial in increasing the likelihood of a pair of successful community members becoming neighbors again in another community even if they are not phylogenetically related. The probability of a mutualistic association could be increased in the future by the sharing of a plasmid by a producer: in essence, an initiation ritual. A recent study showed increased probability of plasmid persistence with increasing numbers of strains in a community (<a href=""#B102"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B102"">102</a>). A similar system exists in colicinogenic plasmids in certain strains of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span>, where the colicin operon, containing a colicin-encoding gene (<i>cxa</i>), is bundled with the immunity-encoding gene (<i>cxi</i> or <i>imX</i>) (<a href=""#B103"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B103"">103</a>). Plasmid transfer is also affected by antibiotic concentration, with the makeup and structure of microbial communities influencing what the target recipients of plasmids may be (<a href=""#B104"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B104"">104</a>), suggesting again that antibiotics have long been tied to the structure and makeup of microbial communities.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">If the secret society system was a dominant selective force in evolving and maintaining antibiotics in the preantibiotic era, then changes in the magnitude, frequency, and diversity of antibiotics after 1940 would likely have caused a consequent shift away from a production-resistance balance in favor of a resistance-dominated evolutionary strategy. We observe just such a signal when we compare the levels of resistance in preantibiotic era collections to modern circulating strains of bacteria (<a href=""#B105"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B105"">105</a>). We also observe such co-option of existing plasmids in the environment (<a href=""#B106"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B106"">106</a>). Such evidence compels us to consider the possibility that the propensity to donate a plasmid containing a production-resistance pair may have regularly been co-opted by bacteria after the dawn of the antibiotic age, driven by selection, as a measure to survive clinical treatment with high concentrations of industrially produced antibiotic compounds.</div></section><section id=""sec-12""><h2>GHOSTS OF RESISTOMES PAST</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">One potential concern inherent in a secret society system is that past violations in which the pairing was broken would likely already have become fixed within the relevant population(s). This leads to consideration of what potential signatures of the paired system might exist beyond those already mentioned.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The question of concern is whether broken pairings in the past could have led to fixation of ARGs, which would in turn lead to the eventual loss of synthesis genes for those specific natural antibiotics. If antibiotics were used in eons past not in a paired way but rather as a way to kill competitors, as has long been the presumption, then resistance to that antibiotic compound would be highly beneficial to fitness. The frequency of resistance carriers would increase and become fixed over time, rendering the antibiotic useless. The ability to synthesize the antibiotic would (presumably) be lost via selection over time. How, then, can we put forward the secret society hypothesis without being able to know if such a simple series of events happened in the distant past?</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">One possible approach would be to look for echoes of selection from long ago pairings compared to the natural antibiotic compounds present today. More precisely, we can look at the half-life of natural antibiotics in their relevant environments to understand how quickly they naturally degrade and use those data to inform a null hypothesis. There are three likely scenarios: extant natural antibiotics could have a longer half-life than other compounds, such as signaling molecules; they could have a shorter half-life; or they could have one that is about the same as that of other synthesized extracellular compounds.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Should natural antibiotics have a comparable half-life, not much new information can be gained. If they have a shorter half-life in the environment than similar extracellular molecules, that would imply that natural antibiotics are incapable of building up in the natural environment, rendering the likelihood of runaway selection for resistance low.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">However, if the half-life of natural antibiotics in the environment is long, then selection for resistance to the accumulated concentration of these compounds becomes more likely. If this happened long ago, we would have lost any signal, because the resistance alleles would have become fixed perhaps before we even knew of microbesâ existence. Therefore, we would expect that natural antibiotics have a shorter half-life than most other naturally produced extracellular compounds, since we can still find such a diversity of them produced in microbial communities. While not a definitive test, such an approach provides for some baseline experimental inquiry.</div></section><section id=""sec-13""><h2>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">To have any hope of countering the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections, we will need to better understand the source, impact, and implications of the problem. While concern over infection rates is a biomedical matter, resistance is the result of evolutionary processes. Here, we argue that as a precursor to developing effective mitigation strategies, we need to expand consideration beyond either biomedicine or evolutionary biology and include the vast ecological dimension.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We began by asking why antibiotics exist at all, given that resistance to clinical drugs has so reliably evolved shortly after the introduction of every new class of antibiotics over the past 80âyears. Antibiotics are not new; they are older than the human species. Yet, within a single human lifetime, many clinical antibiotics have been rendered ineffective. Within another lifetime, antibiotic resistance may become the scourge of our time. To understand this sea change, we look to the biological history of these secondary microbial metabolites for clues as to how their use might be preserved.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Most profound among the differences between the historic use by nature of antibiotics and their current therapeutic purpose is the divorce of antibiotic use from any counterbalanced resistance. Separating these ecologically conjoined twins and removing the context and countercontext put their trajectories on different, and ultimately dangerous, paths. The concentration, duration, and scale of human use created a potent artificial selection for antibiotic resistance to unnaturally high levels and frequencies. Evolution to resistance under clinical antibiotic conditions is, quite literally, a mandatory survival strategy for microbes.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Data collected over decades suggest that antibiotic production phenotypes have largely been paired with complementary antibiotic resistance phenotypes (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>, <a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>, <a href=""#B91"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B91"">91</a>). A similar pairing is found in other microbial toxin systems, such as in colicins (<a href=""#B103"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B103"">103</a>). Natureâs signal in this regard seems clear: producing an antibiotic is not very meaningful without also being resistant. Horizontal gene transfer systems, particularly plasmids, reinforce this conclusion, but the number and type of such plasmids suggest that antibiotics play a larger role than just a weapon of war among microbes. We suggest that this larger role is one of mutualistic cooperation, particularly important in establishing and maintaining microbial communities.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Beneficial interactions in one community can become more likely in other communities if the interactors are both present in the new community. But we still do not understand all the ways in which cooperative interactions begin (<a href=""#B107"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B107"">107</a>). Antibiotic use as described here may offer additional insight into this area. Novel, beneficial interactions can be reinforced and even reciprocated through production of an antibiotic by one or both participants. In addition, the exchange of antibiotic production and resistance genes could cement a relationship for future interactions. The importance of such mutualisms may be intensified given the structured spatial makeup of microbial communities, such as in biofilms, as well as the number and types of producers present (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This pairing of production and resistance levels may have been the main means of maintenance over millions of generations. Neither production amounts nor resistance levels experienced directional selection pressure to increase or decrease, since there would be significant fitness costs without any benefit gained. In addition, if a given cooperation was beneficial to the community, that interaction would be selected for under the conditions experienced. In other words, there would exist selection for a maintained balance between antibiotic production and resistance.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Of course, the implication is that humans broke this microbial social contract by co-opting antibiotics under the presumption that they were an underutilized tool and transforming them into a biological weapon of mass destruction. In doing so, we created a potent selection for higher and higher resistance levels; losing the ability to control or manipulate it was inevitable, if not foreseen.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We have put forward the hypothesis that antibiotic resistance is not an evolutionary reaction to antibiotic warfare but rather a cocomponent of a preferred assembly mechanism for microbial communities. This hypothesis can be investigated experimentally. Such a series of experiments would continue to shine light not only on the mechanism and role of antibiotics in natural systems in the preantibiotic era but also on their importance in an ecological context. Finally, by understanding how the pairing of antibiotic production with resistance can achieve and maintain a balance, we will have developed the potential for mitigation strategies that may impact human health for lifetimes to come.</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02815-22","<div role=""paragraph"">The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) has an indispensable role in the viral life cycle and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. The potential of 3CLpro-inhibitors to select for drug-resistant variants needs to be established. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was passaged <i>in vitro</i> in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161, a probe compound designed in the context of a 3CLpro drug discovery program. We identified a combination of amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) that is associated withâa &gt;20Ã increase in 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir. While two of the single substitutions (E166A and L167F) provide low-level resistance to the inhibitors in a biochemical assay, the triple mutant results in the highest levels of resistance (6Ã to 72Ã). All substitutions are associated with a significant loss of enzymatic 3CLpro activity, suggesting a reduction in viral fitness. Structural biology analysis indicates that the different substitutions reduce the number of inhibitor/enzyme interactions while the binding of the substrate is maintained. These observations will be important for the interpretation of resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors in the clinical setting.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">There is an urgent need for potent and safe antiviral drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Highly efficacious and safe viral protease inhibitors have contributed significantly to the effective treatment of infections with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Coronaviruses have two proteases, the main protease, 3CLpro (or Mpro), and the papain-like protease. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease that cleaves the two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) of SARS-CoV-2 at 11 different sites, resulting in various nonstructural proteins, which are key for viral replication (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The substrate of 3CLpro presents a distinct glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln/Ser, Ala, Gly), while no known human proteases recognize this cleavage site (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). 3CLpro can thus be considered a highly attractive drug target for the development of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). The potential of 3CLpro inhibitors has become apparent with the development of nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), a peptidomimetic reversible covalent inhibitor that is coformulated with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir (the resulting combination being marketed as Paxlovid) (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). When treatment is initiated during the first days after symptom onset, it results in substantial clinical benefit (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7 B8"">â</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). We recently demonstrated that nirmatrelvir is equipotent <i>in vitro</i> against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC). Nirmatrelvir protects Syrian golden hamsters from intranasal infection with different VoCs and prevents transmission to untreated cohoused sentinels (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Other clinical candidate 3CLpro inhibitors include ensitrelvir (S-217622), a nonpeptidic, noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), and PBI-0451 (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). The clinical development of lufotrelvir, an intravenous pro-drug of PF-00835321, has been discontinued (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Treatment with antivirals can result in the selection of resistant viral variants and subsequent therapeutic failure. This has been described extensively in the treatment of (chronic/persistent or acute) viral infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpesviruses, and influenza (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Importantly, transmission of resistant viruses has been reported for HIV and influenza (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). For SARS-CoV-2, selection of resistant isolates has only been described for remdesivir, a polymerase inhibitor. <i>In vitro</i> selection with remdesivir results in the emergence of resistance-associated mutations. Yet in the clinical setting, treatment with remdesivir so far only led to the selection of mutations that are associated with low-level resistance (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">â</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). A causal effect between SARS-CoV-2 resistance to any replicase inhibitors and therapy failure has not yet been demonstrated, most likely because these inhibitors are not yet widely used in the clinic and/or resistant variants might have a fitness disadvantage.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we report on a pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 achieves significant resistance and cross-resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors during serial passage in cell culture in the presence of a first-generation 3CLpro inhibitor, ALG-097161. This molecule was prepared as a tool compound in the context of a drug discovery program.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>SARS-CoV-2 acquires resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors during passage with ALG-097161.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">ALG-097161 is a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with a 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.59âÎ¼M when tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 isolate GHB-0302, a prototypic Wuhan isolate from a Belgian patient, in VeroE6 cells (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). It has no effect on the viability of uninfected host cells at concentrations up to 10âÎ¼M. Since VeroE6 cells have a high efflux of some chemotypes, all selection experiments, antiviral assays, and toxicity assays on these cells were performed in the presence of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux inhibitor CP-100356 (0.5âÎ¼M) (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The antiviral activity of ALG-097161 can be ascribed to inhibition of 3CLpro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>]), 0.014âÎ¼M; <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>), and there is no relevant inhibitory effect on human cathepsin L (IC<sub>50</sub>, &gt;10âÎ¼M; see <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a> in the supplemental material). For comparative purposes, the chemical structures of ALG-097161 and the clinical 3CLpro inhibitors nirmatrelvir, PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir are shown in <a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">To identify resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors, we passaged SARS-CoV-2-GHB-0302 in VeroE6 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161. The selection started at a concentration of 0.4âÎ¼M, and for each next passage the virus was cultured at the same concentration, a 3Ã higher concentration, and a 3Ã lower concentration. The culture demonstrating virus breakthrough, as observed by a significant cytopathic effect, at the highest concentration was then used for the next passage. We started this experiment in triplicate, but for two trials we could not significantly increase the ALG-097161 concentration above 2âÎ¼M by passage 8. These cultures were therefore not further analyzed. In one culture however, the concentration of ALG-097161 could be increased gradually to 5âÎ¼M at passage 8 (p8, day 28) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>) and maintained for one passage at 15âÎ¼M, but that concentration had to be decreased again to 5âÎ¼M for the subsequent passages to allow viral replication until p12 (day 39) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig2"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina) was performed on RNA purified from harvested supernatant at passages 5, 8, and 12. At p5, no mutations were identified in the 3CLpro gene, but at p8 and p12 dominant mutations (&gt;80% of the reads) were present that result in amino acid substitutions L50F E166A and L50F E166A L167F, respectively (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>; <a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). As a control, SARS-CoV-2 was also passaged, at the same frequency, in the absence of compound, and no mutations were identified in the 3CLpro gene at any passage (data not shown).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Selection over the full genome of all nonsynonymous nucleotide changes, which were present inâ&gt;10% of the reads in any of the samples, shows that other nonsynonymous mutations also became fixed (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). This can be explained by the fact that the nucleotide changes, resulting in the 3CLpro substitutions, occurred in a minor variant that also had these background mutations. Importantly, all these other changes are outside the 3CLpro gene or the 3CLpro cleavage sites encoding sequences (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For phenotypic analysis, a new virus stock (p13) was grown in the presence of 4âÎ¼M ALG-097161, and the presence of L50F E166A L167F was confirmed by genotypic analysis. Antiviral testing with this stock showed strong resistance to ALG-097161 and cross-resistance to both nirmatrelvir and PF-00835231 (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). The EC<sub>50</sub> values for all these 3CLpro inhibitors are increasedâ&gt;10Ã. As expected, the sensitivity of the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir remains unchanged.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In a second series of experiments, we investigated whether the observed amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro are sufficient for the resistance phenotype. To this end, we engineered, using an infectious clone (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), virus stocks with L50F, E166A L167F, or L50F E166A L167F. Unfortunately, we were not able to generate virus with E166A or L167F alone. Genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of the mutations and revealed that there were no other nonsynonymous mutations in the genome (data not shown). Antiviral testing with these engineered viruses shows that L50F by itself is not associated with resistance, while E166A L167F and L50F E166A L167F cause a 4.6Ã and 10.3Ã increase, respectively, in EC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161 (<a href=""#tab4"">TableÂ 4</a>). Again, cross-resistance is detected for nirmatrelvir (EC<sub>50</sub> increased 29Ã with the L50F E166A L167F virus). At this stage of our study, ensitrelvir became available; we found that this molecule also shows cross-resistance (EC<sub>50</sub> increased 44Ã with L50F E166A L167F). For all protease inhibitors tested, we observed less resistance with the E166A L167F virus than with the L50F E166A L167F virus. Importantly, all the viruses analyzed remained fully sensitive to remdesivir.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The resistance profile was next confirmed in a previously described cell-based reporter assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymatic function (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). In this gain-of-signal assay, inhibition of 3CLpro results in an increased enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) signal. Introducing the three amino acid changes L50F E166A L167F into the construct resulted in a 23Ã and 28Ã loss of potency for ALG-097161 and nirmatrelvir, respectively (<a href=""#tab5"">TableÂ 5</a>). The resistance level of the triple mutant against PF-00835231 was 6.9Ã.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Effect of amino acid substitutions on 3CLpro enzymatic activity.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Recombinant 3CLpro proteins were produced with the L50F, E166A, and L167F substitutions alone or combined, and their enzymatic activity was tested in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay using a peptide substrate featuring the canonical glutamine cleavage site (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). In this assay, wild-type (WT) 3CLpro shows linear product conversion in the enzyme concentration range of 0.5 to 12.5ânM (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>). Compared with the WT protein, all tested mutants display reduced enzymatic activity (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). E166A and L167F, as single mutants, reduce the activity to about 12 to 20% of that of the wild type, whereas the L50F substitution reduces the activity to as low as 0.4%. The enzyme containing the three substitutions L50F E166A L167F is less compromised than L50F alone, with 4.6% activity compared with the WT. The loss in enzymatic activity for each mutant might be attributed to an apparent reduced binding affinity for the substrate, a loss in protein stability, and/or a reduced formation of active dimers (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). As we tested only a single batch of recombinant protein for each mutant, we cannot exclude that some of this reduced activity is due to a lower-quality enzyme preparation.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Ligand-induced protease activation and dimerization with a low concentration of active site inhibitor has previously been described for MERS 3CLpro (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). This is explained by the inhibitor-stabilizing dimer formation by occupying only one of the two binding sites, while full occupancy of the two dimer active sites results in complete enzyme inhibition (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>). Although we did not perform direct protein dimerization studies, we observed that the impaired enzymatic activity of the mutants can be partially rescued with low concentrations (around 0.05âÎ¼M) of ALG-097161, PF-00835231, or nirmatrelvir, while higher concentrations inhibit product formation (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a>).</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors in the biochemical assay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Based on the characterization of the different enzymes (see above), we decided to use all enzymes at a concentration of 50ânM to quantify the activity of the inhibitors. The effect of the L50F substitution could not be determined under these conditions due to its low intrinsic enzymatic activity. ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir, and PF-00835231 all inhibit WT 3CLpro, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 13 to 23ânM (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>). For ALG-097161, the IC<sub>50</sub> increases 5Ã to 6Ã with single substitutions E166A and L167F and reaches 35Ã for the enzyme with L50F E166A L167F. In comparison, the potency of nirmatrelvir is more affected by substitution E166A versus L167F (10Ã versus 4.4Ã) and reaches a 72Ã increase on the enzyme with the 3 substitutions. For PF-00835231, the shift in IC<sub>50</sub> is in general lower, with a 6.0Ã change versus the enzyme with L50F E166A L167F. However, the shift in IC<sub>50</sub> is higher (~100Ã) with the noncovalent and chemically distinct inhibitor ensitrelvir.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Structural biology and computational chemistry.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Experimental data with the 3CLpro system and computational chemistry investigations were used to rationalize the phenotype observed for ALG-097161 <i>in vitro</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">PF-00835231 and the associated crystal structure <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>) provided a convenient starting point for modeling ALG-097161 in the catalytic pocket of 3CLpro, due to the structural similarity between the two compounds. In particular, both structures feature a hydroxymethyl-ketone warhead that binds covalently to Cys145, as well as a 4-methoxyindole-P3 substituent.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Multiple conformations of ALG-097161 were used as input for docking calculations. These yielded a well-converged predicted binding mode of ALG-097161 covalently bound to the catalytic site of WT 3CLpro (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In line with the crystal structures disclosed for similar compounds (e.g., <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> [<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>]), ALG-097161 is predicted to form a covalent bond from the activated carbon atom of its hydroxymethyl-ketone warhead to the side chain of the catalytic C145 residue, anchoring the inhibitor into the binding cleft of 3CLpro. ALG-097161 forms seven direct hydrogen bonds with the SARS CoV2 3CLpro catalytic site (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>). The oxygen atom of the inhibitorâs warhead interacts with the backbone NH of C145 in the oxyanion hole. The carbonyl oxygen of the P1 lactam hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of H163, while the NH of the P1 lactam is involved in a bifurcated interaction with the side chain of E166 and the backbone carbonyl of F140. The peptide backbone of ALG-097161 anchors itself with hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of H164 and the backbone HN of E166. The NH function of the P3 indole hydrogen-bonds the inhibitor to the backbone carbonyl of E166. The fused bicyclic P2 substituent of ALG-097161 maximizes Van der Waals interactions via extensive productive contacts to the protein side chains that form the S2 subpocket of WT 3CLpro. A key difference with PF-00835231 resides in the (lack of) interaction between the inhibitor backbone and Gln189, a direct consequence of the cyclization on P2, which results in the loss of a hydrogen bond donor site.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig5"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The predicted binding mode of ALG-097161 within 3CLpro provides some rationale for the amino acid substitutions associated with resistance (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). In particular, residues 166 and 167 are located within 5âÃ of the bound ALG-097161. This observation can be extended to both PF-00835231 and nirmatrelvir, based on crystal structures from PDB codes <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>) and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7rfw/pdb"">7RFW</a> (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), respectively. Consequently, the observed substitutions have a direct impact on the compound/target interaction.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">E166 plays a key role in compound binding, with no less than three hydrogen bonds formed with the inhibitors. The E166A substitution eliminates one of the hydrogen bonds made within the P1 subpocket. Interactions with this subpocket are important for substrate recognition by coronaviral 3CLpro enzymes, and its occupancy, in many cases by a lactam moiety, is a key driver for inhibitor potency. It is therefore unsurprising that all three inhibitors are adversely affected by the E166A change (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). Meanwhile, L167F results in the presence of a bulkier side chain on the neighboring position. While this change does not directly conflict with compound binding, the side chain of L167 is in close contact with other residues, including Phe185 (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the L50F E166A L167F enzyme suggest that the bulkier Phe side chain results in some distortion of the neighboring subpocket. In particular, the loop containing L167F moves away from F185, and the distance between the CÎ±s of F185 and L167F/P168 consistently increases, resulting in a more open binding site and a suboptimal fit of the inhibitor, even though H-bond interactions (including the two remaining H-bonds with the A166 backbone) appear conserved throughout 100-ns simulations (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Interestingly, all three inhibitors (ALG-097161, PF-00835231, and nirmatrelvir) were affected by the L167F change.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig6"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The reasons behind the L50F mutation remain more elusive, as this residue falls outside direct Van der Waals or hydrogen-bond contact range to ALG-097161. However, the L50 side chain is located only 2.7âÃ from Q189, a residue which can interact with the peptide backbone of this inhibitor class either directly (as with PF-00835231) or via water molecules (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5</a>). L50F might therefore indirectly affect compound binding by altering the position of Q189 and the subsequent interactions mediated by this residue. However, a rigorous assessment of how this change impacts enzyme activity and/or inhibitor binding would require more elaborate techniques (e.g., free energy perturbation) that are beyond the scope of this work.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Finally, it is anticipated that the natural SARS CoV-2 polyprotein substrates, which are processed by the 3CLpro, are less affected by the L50F, E166A, and/or L167F substitutions, due to their larger size and approximately 2-fold higher number of polar interactions with the protease (as observed in <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2q6g/pdb"">2Q6G</a> for SARS CoV-1 3CLpro in complex with bound substrate).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nirmatrelvir is the first oral SARS-CoV-2 (3CLpro) protease inhibitor granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. To avoid resistance development, HIV and HCV protease inhibitors are used, with great success, in fixed-dose combinations with other directly acting antiviral drugs that have a different mechanism of action (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). As a single agent, several of these inhibitors select (rapidly) for drug-resistant variants. SARS-CoV-2 infections are typically acute in nature; hence, treatment can be of short duration, which may largely reduce the likelihood that resistant variants develop. Yet, also for acute infections, the emergence of drug-resistant variants is a serious concern, certainly in case that such variants can efficiently transmit, resulting in a loss of therapeutic options for patients. For example, the first-generation influenza drugs, amantadanes, are no longer recommended, as resistance to amantadine and rimantadine is widespread (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To monitor clinical drug resistance, it is crucial to identify the mutations involved. To that end, we used the 3CLpro inhibitor ALG-097161, a probe compound in the context of a drug discovery program, to select for resistant variants <i>in vitro</i> by passaging SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing drug concentrations. Similar experiments have been performed with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and polymerase inhibitors (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The selection process indicated that there is a significant barrier to resistance for the 3CLpro inhibitor ALG-097161. The first changes were observed only between passages 5 and 8 (20 to 30âdays). These were the double substitution L50F E166A in 3CLpro, which then evolved to the triple substitution L50F E166A L167F. Phenotyping this triple mutant virus revealed a 63Ã increase in the EC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161. Moreover, significant cross-resistance (&gt;10Ã increase EC<sub>50</sub>) was observed with nirmatrelvir, the active component of Paxlovid, and PF-00835231, an earlier 3CLpro clinical candidate. Next, we engineered an infectious clone with the only the 3Clpro substitutions, L50F E166A L167F, and the resistance against ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir and also ensitrelvir could be confirmed (&gt;10Ã increase in EC<sub>50</sub>). As a second confirmation, a cell-based assay was used with heterologous expression of wild-type and mutated 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) and a substrate linked to a reporter protein. The EC<sub>50</sub> values for ALG-097161 and nirmatrelvir in this assay increased 23Ã and 28Ã, respectively, compared with the wild type. Importantly, all of the viruses analyzed remained fully susceptible to the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir (GS-441524 form).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We further characterized the 3CLpro substitutions using biochemical assays. Enzymes carrying the single substitution L50F, E166A, or L167F were found to have markedly lower enzymatic activity (&lt;20% compared to the wild type). Each of the enzymes was also less efficiently inhibited by the 3CLpro inhibitors. The largest increase in IC<sub>50</sub> was observed when all three substitutions, L50F E166A L167F, were combined. For this triple mutant enzyme, the IC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir, and ensitrelvir increased by 35Ã, 72Ã, and 93Ã, respectively.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A structural biology analysis reveals that the substitutions decrease interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor. E166A causes a direct loss of a hydrogen bond with the lactam moiety that is found in all the inhibitors tested here, L167F increases the size of the binding pocket, causing a decrease of the Van der Waals forces between enzyme and inhibitor, and L50F is thought to change the rotamer conformation of Q189, which, for the wild type, has many interactions with the inhibitors through a network of water molecules.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The loss of interactions, resulting from amino acid substitutions associated with resistance, might have a lower effect on substrates than on inhibitors, as the former rely on a significantly higher number of interactions for binding. Consequently, these resistance-associated mutations seem to allow a better discrimination between substrate and inhibitor at the expense of intrinsic enzymatic activity.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A recent sequence analysis across 4.9 million global SARS-CoV-2 isolates, circulating prior to the introduction of Paxlovid, showed a high genetic conservation of the 3CLpro protein (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). From the 306 amino acid positions, only 3 have a polymorphism in &gt;1% of the samples, and 13 have a change in 1% to 0.11% of the samples. Changes at position L50, E166, or L167 have a &lt;0.11% prevalence. E166 displays extreme high conservation in this data set, with &lt;0.001% samples having an alternative amino acid.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">At this moment, peer-reviewed information on resistance against 3CLpro inhibitors in COVID-19 patients is, to our knowledge, not available. The Paxlovid label indicates that E166V is more common in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated subjects relative to placebo-treated subjects (0.8% and &lt;0.2%, respectively), and in one patient, with a baseline L50F substitution, the E166V substitution cooccurred with L50F on day 5 of treatment (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Both these observations are in accordance with the results described above.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While we can clearly observe resistance of different 3CLpro inhibitors for the L50F E166A L167V virus, we could not fully characterize the contribution of each substitution by itself. During the selection experiment, L50F together with E166A was selected first, and L167V was acquired later. Additional cell-based experiments demonstrate that an L50F-carrying virus is not resistant, while biochemical experiments indicate that E166A and L167F are associated with resistance. Taking these findings together, we hypothesize that E166A is the main driver for resistance, that L50F is needed to support E166A, and that the presence of L167F further increases resistance. It would require an extensive study of the replication capacity of the different variants to support this hypothesis. Importantly, clear nirmatrelvir/ensitrelvir cross-resistance is observed with both the E166A L167F and L50F E166A L167F viruses.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">During the writing of this manuscript, two other studies on the selection of nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 viruses were reported. One group performedâ&gt;480 independent selection experiments, resulting in the identification of multiple pathways of nirmatrelvir resistance (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). They conclude that E166V confers the highest level of resistance of all substitutions tested (100Ã for nirmatrelvir; 23Ã for ensitrelvir). In addition, these authors show that E166V causes a reduced fitness that is restored by adding L50F or T21I. The selection of L50F E166V by nirmatrelvir <i>in vitro</i> has also been reported by another group (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Also, these authors come to the conclusion that E166V is responsible for resistance, whereas L50F is a compensatory substitution required for maintaining fitness. As E166A and E166V are very similar substitutions (alanine and valine have similar chemical structures), these findings are in strong agreement with our observations. A third group engineered a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-variant, which has SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro expressed in an artificial polyprotein, for which the replication depends on 3CLpro activity. Selection for nirmatrelvir resistance resulted in the appearance of L167F in the absence of other mutations, and an engineered SARS-CoV-2 infectious clone with only the L167F substitution showed a marginal level of resistance for nirmatrelvir (2Ã increase EC<sub>50</sub>) (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Important to mention is also the work of Flynn et al. (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>), who performed different functional 3CLpro screens in yeast to study the resilience of all amino acid positions toward substitutions. Interestingly, the authors conclude that position E166 is highly tolerant to substitutions including the E166A or E166V substitution. Based on available structural biology data of 3CLpro in complex with inhibitors or natural substrate and their functional screen data, these authors identified E166A and E166Q as potentially resistance-associated substitutions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our report emphasizes the need for additional research to elucidate potential resistance pathways of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors <i>in vitro</i>. It is also a starting point for the surveillance of nirmatrelvir resistance and indicates the potential need for combination therapies with different classes of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>(i) Illumina sequencing.</b> RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was outsourced to Eurofins Genomics (ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 WGS, Konstanz, Germany), who performed reverse transcription, enrichment of the viral genome using a primer set similar to the ARTIC primers (&gt;200 primer pairs, covering the full 29.9-kb viral genome), generation of libraries, Illumina sequencing (2âÃâ150-bp read mode), and sequence cleaning to remove adapters and poor-quality bases. Sequences were further analyzed using Geneious Prime software (v2022.2.1) by mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (RefSeq; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512"">NC_045512</a>), and variant calling was performed as described by the software manufacturer (<a href=""https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045070991-Assembly-of-SARS-CoV-2-genomes-from-tiled-amplicon-Illumina-sequencing-using-Geneious-Prime"">https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045070991-Assembly-of-SARS-CoV-2-genomes-from-tiled-amplicon-Illumina-sequencing-using-Geneious-Prime</a>). For each sample, &gt;0.9 million (M) reads that could be aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 genome were obtained, with &gt;99.5% of untrimmed bases being of high quality and with a mean coverage ofâ&gt;4,000 reads.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>(ii) Oxford Nanopore sequencing.</b> As a control, the same samples were also sequenced using an inhouse pipeline. For this, reverse transcription was carried out via SuperScript IV, and cDNA was posteriorly amplified using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) with the ARTIC nCov-2019 primers, following the recommendations in the sequencing protocol of the ARTIC Network (<a href=""https://artic.network/ncov-2019"">https://artic.network/ncov-2019</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">The 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), the concentration of compound required for 50% antiviral activity, was determined on VeroE6 cells as follows. On day -1, the test compounds were serially diluted in 100 Î¼L assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% [vol/vol] FCS) in 96-well plates. In the next step, 50 Î¼L of VeroE6 cells (25,000 cells/well) was added together with 2 Î¼M the MDR1-inhibitor CP-100356 (final concentration 0.5âÎ¼M). The plates were incubated (37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 95% relative humidity) overnight. On day 0, 50 Î¼L of SARS-CoV-2 WT or the triple mutant strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per cell was added, and the plates were stored in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of antiviral activity, the VeroE6 cells underwent a cytopathic effect. Cell viability was determined 4âdays postinfection (p.i.) using viability staining with MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">We used the in-yeast transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning method as described previously with some adaptations (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). In sum, the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome was encoded in 12 overlapping DNA fragments. These so-called WU-fragments and a TAR-vector were homologously recombined in yeast, forming the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was encoded on WU-fragment 5 and was replaced with newly generated and overlapping PCR products to introduce the amino acid changes L50F, E166A L167F, or L50F E166A L167F. The overlapping PCR products were made via reverse transcription from RNA purified from viral RNA (vRNA) of the virus stock obtained from the selection. In brief, cDNA was generated from RNA by LunaScript RT SuperMix (NEB). PCRs targeting the 3CLpro gene were performed using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB), and the resulting PCR products were mixed and matched to recombine SARSCoV-2 3CLpro<sup>L50F</sup>, SARSCoV-2 3Clpro<sup>E166A L167F</sup>, and SARSCoV-2 3CLpro<sup>L50F E166A L167F</sup>. All PCR products were purified with the high pure PCR product purification kit (Roche) before being used for TAR cloning.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>In vitro</i> transcription was performed for EagI-cleaved YACs and the PCR-amplified SARS-CoV-2 N gene using the T7 RiboMAX large-scale RNA production system (Promega) as described previously (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Transcribed capped mRNA was electroporated into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells expressing SARS-CoV N protein. Electroporated cells were cocultured with susceptible Vero TMPRSS2 cells to produce passage 0 (P.0) of the recombinant viruses. Passage 1 virus stocks were further produced in Vero human transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cells, and the presence of mutations was confirmed by Illumina sequencing. These results also showed the absence of other nonsynonymous mutations in the viral genome.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>3CLpro cell-based reporter assay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The cell-based reporter assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymatic function was described previously (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). This gain-of-signal assay is based on the expression of a chimeric protein consisting of Src-Mpro-Tat-eGFP in which the Mpro amino acid sequence is flanked with cognate N- and C-terminal self-cleavage sites. While it was expected that Mpro inhibition would result in a different subcellular localization of the GFP signal, it was found that without Mpro inhibition, there is no detectable GFP expression, while in the presence of Mpro inhibition, there is high GFP expressionâhence, the name gain-of-signal assay. The exact mechanism behind this reporter system is not known, but results suggest a mechanism in which Mpro activity somehow suppresses the accumulation of reporter mRNA in transfected cells.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">293T cells were maintained at 37Â°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Corning, cat. no. 10-013-CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, cat. no. 10091148) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, cat. no. 15140122). 293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5âÃâ10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and returned to incubation for 24 h. The following day, cells were treated with compound at a final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration of 2% prior to transfection with 100âng of the wild-type or triple mutant (L50F E166A L167F) plasmid with Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15338100) for 24 h. Then, 24 h posttransfection, GFP fluorescence was detected with a Victor device (Perkin Elmer) using the fluorescein 485/535 setting. Inhibition was determined from the resulting fluorescent signal and graphed using a variable slope four-parameter curve fitting with GraphPad Prism (v9.2.0).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3>3CLpro FRET-based assay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The FRET-based assay was performed similarly to the self-assembled monolayers for matrix-assisted desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI-MS) assay. Assays were performed in 20-Î¼L volume in 384-well nonbinding low-volume plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) at ambient temperature. 3CLpro and its mutants were preincubated with inhibitors for 30âmin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a FRET-compatible peptide substrate, dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH<sub>2</sub>. Fluorescence was measured for 90 min at 2-min intervals using 340/460-excitation/emission filters on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by fitting the curves using a four-parameter equation in GraphPad Prism.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">PDB structure <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (complex with PF-00835231) was used as the starting point for modeling compounds in WT and mutant (L50F E166A L167F) 3CLpro. The receptor structure was cleaned up and minimized with restraints ahead of docking using the Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro (SchrÃ¶dinger). Ligands were processed using the Ligprep module in Maestro. Stereoisomers were not generated, as the absolute configuration of the ligand was known.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Covalent docking was used to predict the binding mode of ALG-097161. C145 was specified as the reactive residue for covalent binding, and the centroid of the X-ray reference ligand was used to define the investigated binding site. A custom covalent reaction parameter file was used to define the reaction between the warhead moiety and the catalytic C145. A high-accuracy (pose prediction thorough) docking methodology was implemented for pose prediction. Initial docking poses within 4âkcal/mol (glide gscore) were collected for further processing. Residues within 6âÃ of the bound compound were minimized after covalent bond formation. The top 5 binding mode suggestions were saved for visual inspection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Initial structures for the L50F E166A L167F triple mutant were built by introducing the mutations directly into the WT complex. An initial restrained minimization was done with the protein preparation wizard to remove any unacceptable clash. Next, a Desmond simulation system was built (see below) and a 100-ps energy minimization procedure was run with Desmond to reach the nearest energy minimum.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the Desmond-GPU package. A simulation system was first set up around the protein-inhibitor complex, including a 10-Ã water box, Na<sup>+</sup> ions necessary to neutralize the system, and additional Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>â</sup> ions to simulate a 0.15 M NaCl concentration. OPLS4 was selected as the force field. The NPT ensemble (temperature [<i>T</i>]â=â300 K, <i>P</i>â=â1.01325âbar) was used. The system was relaxed prior to simulation. MD simulations were run for a (simulated) period of 100âns, with frames saved every 0.25âns (total, 400 frames). The final frames were energy-minimized (100-ps minimization protocol). Protein-ligand interactions and distances were evaluated in the 5-ns to 100-ns period.</div></section></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Paxlovid is the first oral antiviral approved for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antiviral treatments are often associated with the development of drug-resistant viruses. In order to guide the use of novel antivirals, it is essential to understand the risk of resistance development and to characterize the associated changes in the viral genes and proteins. In this work, we describe for the first time a pathway that allows SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance against Paxlovid <i>in vitro</i>. The characteristics of <i>in vitro</i> antiviral resistance development may be predictive for the clinical situation. Therefore, our work will be important for the management of COVID-19 with Paxlovid and next-generation SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">There is an urgent need for potent and safe antiviral drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Highly efficacious and safe viral protease inhibitors have contributed significantly to the effective treatment of infections with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Coronaviruses have two proteases, the main protease, 3CLpro (or Mpro), and the papain-like protease. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease that cleaves the two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) of SARS-CoV-2 at 11 different sites, resulting in various nonstructural proteins, which are key for viral replication (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The substrate of 3CLpro presents a distinct glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln/Ser, Ala, Gly), while no known human proteases recognize this cleavage site (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). 3CLpro can thus be considered a highly attractive drug target for the development of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). The potential of 3CLpro inhibitors has become apparent with the development of nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), a peptidomimetic reversible covalent inhibitor that is coformulated with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir (the resulting combination being marketed as Paxlovid) (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). When treatment is initiated during the first days after symptom onset, it results in substantial clinical benefit (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7 B8"">â</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). We recently demonstrated that nirmatrelvir is equipotent <i>in vitro</i> against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC). Nirmatrelvir protects Syrian golden hamsters from intranasal infection with different VoCs and prevents transmission to untreated cohoused sentinels (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Other clinical candidate 3CLpro inhibitors include ensitrelvir (S-217622), a nonpeptidic, noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), and PBI-0451 (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). The clinical development of lufotrelvir, an intravenous pro-drug of PF-00835321, has been discontinued (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Treatment with antivirals can result in the selection of resistant viral variants and subsequent therapeutic failure. This has been described extensively in the treatment of (chronic/persistent or acute) viral infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpesviruses, and influenza (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Importantly, transmission of resistant viruses has been reported for HIV and influenza (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). For SARS-CoV-2, selection of resistant isolates has only been described for remdesivir, a polymerase inhibitor. <i>In vitro</i> selection with remdesivir results in the emergence of resistance-associated mutations. Yet in the clinical setting, treatment with remdesivir so far only led to the selection of mutations that are associated with low-level resistance (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">â</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). A causal effect between SARS-CoV-2 resistance to any replicase inhibitors and therapy failure has not yet been demonstrated, most likely because these inhibitors are not yet widely used in the clinic and/or resistant variants might have a fitness disadvantage.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we report on a pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 achieves significant resistance and cross-resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors during serial passage in cell culture in the presence of a first-generation 3CLpro inhibitor, ALG-097161. This molecule was prepared as a tool compound in the context of a drug discovery program.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>SARS-CoV-2 acquires resistance to 3CLpro inhibitors during passage with ALG-097161.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">ALG-097161 is a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with a 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.59âÎ¼M when tested for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 isolate GHB-0302, a prototypic Wuhan isolate from a Belgian patient, in VeroE6 cells (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). It has no effect on the viability of uninfected host cells at concentrations up to 10âÎ¼M. Since VeroE6 cells have a high efflux of some chemotypes, all selection experiments, antiviral assays, and toxicity assays on these cells were performed in the presence of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux inhibitor CP-100356 (0.5âÎ¼M) (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The antiviral activity of ALG-097161 can be ascribed to inhibition of 3CLpro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>]), 0.014âÎ¼M; <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>), and there is no relevant inhibitory effect on human cathepsin L (IC<sub>50</sub>, &gt;10âÎ¼M; see <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a> in the supplemental material). For comparative purposes, the chemical structures of ALG-097161 and the clinical 3CLpro inhibitors nirmatrelvir, PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir are shown in <a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">To identify resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors, we passaged SARS-CoV-2-GHB-0302 in VeroE6 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161. The selection started at a concentration of 0.4âÎ¼M, and for each next passage the virus was cultured at the same concentration, a 3Ã higher concentration, and a 3Ã lower concentration. The culture demonstrating virus breakthrough, as observed by a significant cytopathic effect, at the highest concentration was then used for the next passage. We started this experiment in triplicate, but for two trials we could not significantly increase the ALG-097161 concentration above 2âÎ¼M by passage 8. These cultures were therefore not further analyzed. In one culture however, the concentration of ALG-097161 could be increased gradually to 5âÎ¼M at passage 8 (p8, day 28) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>) and maintained for one passage at 15âÎ¼M, but that concentration had to be decreased again to 5âÎ¼M for the subsequent passages to allow viral replication until p12 (day 39) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig2"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina) was performed on RNA purified from harvested supernatant at passages 5, 8, and 12. At p5, no mutations were identified in the 3CLpro gene, but at p8 and p12 dominant mutations (&gt;80% of the reads) were present that result in amino acid substitutions L50F E166A and L50F E166A L167F, respectively (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>; <a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). As a control, SARS-CoV-2 was also passaged, at the same frequency, in the absence of compound, and no mutations were identified in the 3CLpro gene at any passage (data not shown).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Selection over the full genome of all nonsynonymous nucleotide changes, which were present inâ&gt;10% of the reads in any of the samples, shows that other nonsynonymous mutations also became fixed (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). This can be explained by the fact that the nucleotide changes, resulting in the 3CLpro substitutions, occurred in a minor variant that also had these background mutations. Importantly, all these other changes are outside the 3CLpro gene or the 3CLpro cleavage sites encoding sequences (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For phenotypic analysis, a new virus stock (p13) was grown in the presence of 4âÎ¼M ALG-097161, and the presence of L50F E166A L167F was confirmed by genotypic analysis. Antiviral testing with this stock showed strong resistance to ALG-097161 and cross-resistance to both nirmatrelvir and PF-00835231 (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). The EC<sub>50</sub> values for all these 3CLpro inhibitors are increasedâ&gt;10Ã. As expected, the sensitivity of the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir remains unchanged.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In a second series of experiments, we investigated whether the observed amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro are sufficient for the resistance phenotype. To this end, we engineered, using an infectious clone (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), virus stocks with L50F, E166A L167F, or L50F E166A L167F. Unfortunately, we were not able to generate virus with E166A or L167F alone. Genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of the mutations and revealed that there were no other nonsynonymous mutations in the genome (data not shown). Antiviral testing with these engineered viruses shows that L50F by itself is not associated with resistance, while E166A L167F and L50F E166A L167F cause a 4.6Ã and 10.3Ã increase, respectively, in EC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161 (<a href=""#tab4"">TableÂ 4</a>). Again, cross-resistance is detected for nirmatrelvir (EC<sub>50</sub> increased 29Ã with the L50F E166A L167F virus). At this stage of our study, ensitrelvir became available; we found that this molecule also shows cross-resistance (EC<sub>50</sub> increased 44Ã with L50F E166A L167F). For all protease inhibitors tested, we observed less resistance with the E166A L167F virus than with the L50F E166A L167F virus. Importantly, all the viruses analyzed remained fully sensitive to remdesivir.</div>

In this gain-of-signal assay, inhibition of 3CLpro results in an increased enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) signal. Introducing the three amino acid changes L50F E166A L167F into the construct resulted in a 23Ã and 28Ã loss of potency for ALG-097161 and nirmatrelvir, respectively (<a href=""#tab5"">TableÂ 5</a>).

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Effect of amino acid substitutions on 3CLpro enzymatic activity.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Recombinant 3CLpro proteins were produced with the L50F, E166A, and L167F substitutions alone or combined, and their enzymatic activity was tested in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay using a peptide substrate featuring the canonical glutamine cleavage site (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). In this assay, wild-type (WT) 3CLpro shows linear product conversion in the enzyme concentration range of 0.5 to 12.5ânM (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>). Compared with the WT protein, all tested mutants display reduced enzymatic activity (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). E166A and L167F, as single mutants, reduce the activity to about 12 to 20% of that of the wild type, whereas the L50F substitution reduces the activity to as low as 0.4%. The enzyme containing the three substitutions L50F E166A L167F is less compromised than L50F alone, with 4.6% activity compared with the WT. The loss in enzymatic activity for each mutant might be attributed to an apparent reduced binding affinity for the substrate, a loss in protein stability, and/or a reduced formation of active dimers (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). As we tested only a single batch of recombinant protein for each mutant, we cannot exclude that some of this reduced activity is due to a lower-quality enzyme preparation.</div>

This is explained by the inhibitor-stabilizing dimer formation by occupying only one of the two binding sites, while full occupancy of the two dimer active sites results in complete enzyme inhibition (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>). Although we did not perform direct protein dimerization studies, we observed that the impaired enzymatic activity of the mutants can be partially rescued with low concentrations (around 0.05âÎ¼M) of ALG-097161, PF-00835231, or nirmatrelvir, while higher concentrations inhibit product formation (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Based on the characterization of the different enzymes (see above), we decided to use all enzymes at a concentration of 50ânM to quantify the activity of the inhibitors. The effect of the L50F substitution could not be determined under these conditions due to its low intrinsic enzymatic activity. ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir, and PF-00835231 all inhibit WT 3CLpro, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 13 to 23ânM (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>). For ALG-097161, the IC<sub>50</sub> increases 5Ã to 6Ã with single substitutions E166A and L167F and reaches 35Ã for the enzyme with L50F E166A L167F. In comparison, the potency of nirmatrelvir is more affected by substitution E166A versus L167F (10Ã versus 4.4Ã) and reaches a 72Ã increase on the enzyme with the 3 substitutions. For PF-00835231, the shift in IC<sub>50</sub> is in general lower, with a 6.0Ã change versus the enzyme with L50F E166A L167F. However, the shift in IC<sub>50</sub> is higher (~100Ã) with the noncovalent and chemically distinct inhibitor ensitrelvir.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Structural biology and computational chemistry.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Experimental data with the 3CLpro system and computational chemistry investigations were used to rationalize the phenotype observed for ALG-097161 <i>in vitro</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">PF-00835231 and the associated crystal structure <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>) provided a convenient starting point for modeling ALG-097161 in the catalytic pocket of 3CLpro, due to the structural similarity between the two compounds. In particular, both structures feature a hydroxymethyl-ketone warhead that binds covalently to Cys145, as well as a 4-methoxyindole-P3 substituent.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Multiple conformations of ALG-097161 were used as input for docking calculations. These yielded a well-converged predicted binding mode of ALG-097161 covalently bound to the catalytic site of WT 3CLpro (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In line with the crystal structures disclosed for similar compounds (e.g., <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> [<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>]), ALG-097161 is predicted to form a covalent bond from the activated carbon atom of its hydroxymethyl-ketone warhead to the side chain of the catalytic C145 residue, anchoring the inhibitor into the binding cleft of 3CLpro. ALG-097161 forms seven direct hydrogen bonds with the SARS CoV2 3CLpro catalytic site (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>). The oxygen atom of the inhibitorâs warhead interacts with the backbone NH of C145 in the oxyanion hole. The carbonyl oxygen of the P1 lactam hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of H163, while the NH of the P1 lactam is involved in a bifurcated interaction with the side chain of E166 and the backbone carbonyl of F140. The peptide backbone of ALG-097161 anchors itself with hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of H164 and the backbone HN of E166. The NH function of the P3 indole hydrogen-bonds the inhibitor to the backbone carbonyl of E166. The fused bicyclic P2 substituent of ALG-097161 maximizes Van der Waals interactions via extensive productive contacts to the protein side chains that form the S2 subpocket of WT 3CLpro. A key difference with PF-00835231 resides in the (lack of) interaction between the inhibitor backbone and Gln189, a direct consequence of the cyclization on P2, which results in the loss of a hydrogen bond donor site.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig5"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The predicted binding mode of ALG-097161 within 3CLpro provides some rationale for the amino acid substitutions associated with resistance (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). In particular, residues 166 and 167 are located within 5âÃ of the bound ALG-097161. This observation can be extended to both PF-00835231 and nirmatrelvir, based on crystal structures from PDB codes <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>) and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7rfw/pdb"">7RFW</a> (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), respectively. Consequently, the observed substitutions have a direct impact on the compound/target interaction.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">E166 plays a key role in compound binding, with no less than three hydrogen bonds formed with the inhibitors. The E166A substitution eliminates one of the hydrogen bonds made within the P1 subpocket. Interactions with this subpocket are important for substrate recognition by coronaviral 3CLpro enzymes, and its occupancy, in many cases by a lactam moiety, is a key driver for inhibitor potency. It is therefore unsurprising that all three inhibitors are adversely affected by the E166A change (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). Meanwhile, L167F results in the presence of a bulkier side chain on the neighboring position. While this change does not directly conflict with compound binding, the side chain of L167 is in close contact with other residues, including Phe185 (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the L50F E166A L167F enzyme suggest that the bulkier Phe side chain results in some distortion of the neighboring subpocket. In particular, the loop containing L167F moves away from F185, and the distance between the CÎ±s of F185 and L167F/P168 consistently increases, resulting in a more open binding site and a suboptimal fit of the inhibitor, even though H-bond interactions (including the two remaining H-bonds with the A166 backbone) appear conserved throughout 100-ns simulations (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Interestingly, all three inhibitors (ALG-097161, PF-00835231, and nirmatrelvir) were affected by the L167F change.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig6"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The reasons behind the L50F mutation remain more elusive, as this residue falls outside direct Van der Waals or hydrogen-bond contact range to ALG-097161. However, the L50 side chain is located only 2.7âÃ from Q189, a residue which can interact with the peptide backbone of this inhibitor class either directly (as with PF-00835231) or via water molecules (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5</a>). L50F might therefore indirectly affect compound binding by altering the position of Q189 and the subsequent interactions mediated by this residue. However, a rigorous assessment of how this change impacts enzyme activity and/or inhibitor binding would require more elaborate techniques (e.g., free energy perturbation) that are beyond the scope of this work.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Finally, it is anticipated that the natural SARS CoV-2 polyprotein substrates, which are processed by the 3CLpro, are less affected by the L50F, E166A, and/or L167F substitutions, due to their larger size and approximately 2-fold higher number of polar interactions with the protease (as observed in <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2q6g/pdb"">2Q6G</a> for SARS CoV-1 3CLpro in complex with bound substrate).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nirmatrelvir is the first oral SARS-CoV-2 (3CLpro) protease inhibitor granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. To avoid resistance development, HIV and HCV protease inhibitors are used, with great success, in fixed-dose combinations with other directly acting antiviral drugs that have a different mechanism of action (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). As a single agent, several of these inhibitors select (rapidly) for drug-resistant variants. SARS-CoV-2 infections are typically acute in nature; hence, treatment can be of short duration, which may largely reduce the likelihood that resistant variants develop. Yet, also for acute infections, the emergence of drug-resistant variants is a serious concern, certainly in case that such variants can efficiently transmit, resulting in a loss of therapeutic options for patients. For example, the first-generation influenza drugs, amantadanes, are no longer recommended, as resistance to amantadine and rimantadine is widespread (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To monitor clinical drug resistance, it is crucial to identify the mutations involved. To that end, we used the 3CLpro inhibitor ALG-097161, a probe compound in the context of a drug discovery program, to select for resistant variants <i>in vitro</i> by passaging SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing drug concentrations. Similar experiments have been performed with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and polymerase inhibitors (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The selection process indicated that there is a significant barrier to resistance for the 3CLpro inhibitor ALG-097161. The first changes were observed only between passages 5 and 8 (20 to 30âdays). These were the double substitution L50F E166A in 3CLpro, which then evolved to the triple substitution L50F E166A L167F. Phenotyping this triple mutant virus revealed a 63Ã increase in the EC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161. Moreover, significant cross-resistance (&gt;10Ã increase EC<sub>50</sub>) was observed with nirmatrelvir, the active component of Paxlovid, and PF-00835231, an earlier 3CLpro clinical candidate. Next, we engineered an infectious clone with the only the 3Clpro substitutions, L50F E166A L167F, and the resistance against ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir and also ensitrelvir could be confirmed (&gt;10Ã increase in EC<sub>50</sub>). As a second confirmation, a cell-based assay was used with heterologous expression of wild-type and mutated 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) and a substrate linked to a reporter protein. The EC<sub>50</sub> values for ALG-097161 and nirmatrelvir in this assay increased 23Ã and 28Ã, respectively, compared with the wild type. Importantly, all of the viruses analyzed remained fully susceptible to the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir (GS-441524 form).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We further characterized the 3CLpro substitutions using biochemical assays. Enzymes carrying the single substitution L50F, E166A, or L167F were found to have markedly lower enzymatic activity (&lt;20% compared to the wild type). Each of the enzymes was also less efficiently inhibited by the 3CLpro inhibitors. The largest increase in IC<sub>50</sub> was observed when all three substitutions, L50F E166A L167F, were combined. For this triple mutant enzyme, the IC<sub>50</sub> for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir, and ensitrelvir increased by 35Ã, 72Ã, and 93Ã, respectively.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A structural biology analysis reveals that the substitutions decrease interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor. E166A causes a direct loss of a hydrogen bond with the lactam moiety that is found in all the inhibitors tested here, L167F increases the size of the binding pocket, causing a decrease of the Van der Waals forces between enzyme and inhibitor, and L50F is thought to change the rotamer conformation of Q189, which, for the wild type, has many interactions with the inhibitors through a network of water molecules.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The loss of interactions, resulting from amino acid substitutions associated with resistance, might have a lower effect on substrates than on inhibitors, as the former rely on a significantly higher number of interactions for binding. Consequently, these resistance-associated mutations seem to allow a better discrimination between substrate and inhibitor at the expense of intrinsic enzymatic activity.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A recent sequence analysis across 4.9 million global SARS-CoV-2 isolates, circulating prior to the introduction of Paxlovid, showed a high genetic conservation of the 3CLpro protein (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). From the 306 amino acid positions, only 3 have a polymorphism in &gt;1% of the samples, and 13 have a change in 1% to 0.11% of the samples. Changes at position L50, E166, or L167 have a &lt;0.11% prevalence. E166 displays extreme high conservation in this data set, with &lt;0.001% samples having an alternative amino acid.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">At this moment, peer-reviewed information on resistance against 3CLpro inhibitors in COVID-19 patients is, to our knowledge, not available. The Paxlovid label indicates that E166V is more common in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated subjects relative to placebo-treated subjects (0.8% and &lt;0.2%, respectively), and in one patient, with a baseline L50F substitution, the E166V substitution cooccurred with L50F on day 5 of treatment (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Both these observations are in accordance with the results described above.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While we can clearly observe resistance of different 3CLpro inhibitors for the L50F E166A L167V virus, we could not fully characterize the contribution of each substitution by itself. During the selection experiment, L50F together with E166A was selected first, and L167V was acquired later. Additional cell-based experiments demonstrate that an L50F-carrying virus is not resistant, while biochemical experiments indicate that E166A and L167F are associated with resistance. Taking these findings together, we hypothesize that E166A is the main driver for resistance, that L50F is needed to support E166A, and that the presence of L167F further increases resistance. It would require an extensive study of the replication capacity of the different variants to support this hypothesis. Importantly, clear nirmatrelvir/ensitrelvir cross-resistance is observed with both the E166A L167F and L50F E166A L167F viruses.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">During the writing of this manuscript, two other studies on the selection of nirmatrelvir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 viruses were reported. One group performedâ&gt;480 independent selection experiments, resulting in the identification of multiple pathways of nirmatrelvir resistance (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). They conclude that E166V confers the highest level of resistance of all substitutions tested (100Ã for nirmatrelvir; 23Ã for ensitrelvir). In addition, these authors show that E166V causes a reduced fitness that is restored by adding L50F or T21I. The selection of L50F E166V by nirmatrelvir <i>in vitro</i> has also been reported by another group (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Also, these authors come to the conclusion that E166V is responsible for resistance, whereas L50F is a compensatory substitution required for maintaining fitness. As E166A and E166V are very similar substitutions (alanine and valine have similar chemical structures), these findings are in strong agreement with our observations. A third group engineered a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-variant, which has SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro expressed in an artificial polyprotein, for which the replication depends on 3CLpro activity. Selection for nirmatrelvir resistance resulted in the appearance of L167F in the absence of other mutations, and an engineered SARS-CoV-2 infectious clone with only the L167F substitution showed a marginal level of resistance for nirmatrelvir (2Ã increase EC<sub>50</sub>) (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Important to mention is also the work of Flynn et al. (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>), who performed different functional 3CLpro screens in yeast to study the resilience of all amino acid positions toward substitutions. Interestingly, the authors conclude that position E166 is highly tolerant to substitutions including the E166A or E166V substitution. Based on available structural biology data of 3CLpro in complex with inhibitors or natural substrate and their functional screen data, these authors identified E166A and E166Q as potentially resistance-associated substitutions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our report emphasizes the need for additional research to elucidate potential resistance pathways of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors <i>in vitro</i>. It is also a starting point for the surveillance of nirmatrelvir resistance and indicates the potential need for combination therapies with different classes of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>(i) Illumina sequencing.</b> RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was outsourced to Eurofins Genomics (ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 WGS, Konstanz, Germany), who performed reverse transcription, enrichment of the viral genome using a primer set similar to the ARTIC primers (&gt;200 primer pairs, covering the full 29.9-kb viral genome), generation of libraries, Illumina sequencing (2âÃâ150-bp read mode), and sequence cleaning to remove adapters and poor-quality bases. Sequences were further analyzed using Geneious Prime software (v2022.2.1) by mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (RefSeq; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512"">NC_045512</a>), and variant calling was performed as described by the software manufacturer (<a href=""https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045070991-Assembly-of-SARS-CoV-2-genomes-from-tiled-amplicon-Illumina-sequencing-using-Geneious-Prime"">https://help.geneious.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045070991-Assembly-of-SARS-CoV-2-genomes-from-tiled-amplicon-Illumina-sequencing-using-Geneious-Prime</a>). For each sample, &gt;0.9 million (M) reads that could be aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 genome were obtained, with &gt;99.5% of untrimmed bases being of high quality and with a mean coverage ofâ&gt;4,000 reads.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>(ii) Oxford Nanopore sequencing.</b> As a control, the same samples were also sequenced using an inhouse pipeline. For this, reverse transcription was carried out via SuperScript IV, and cDNA was posteriorly amplified using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) with the ARTIC nCov-2019 primers, following the recommendations in the sequencing protocol of the ARTIC Network (<a href=""https://artic.network/ncov-2019"">https://artic.network/ncov-2019</a>). Samples were multiplexed following the manufacturerâs recommendations using the Oxford Nanopore native barcoding expansion kits NBD104 (1-12) and NBD114 (13-24), in conjunction with ligation sequencing kit 109 (Oxford Nanopore). Sequencing was carried out on a MinION sequencer using R9.4.1 flow cells and MinKNOW 2.0 software. Both methods resulted in the same consensus sequence for each sample. For further mutation analysis, we used the deep sequencing data generated by the Illumina protocol.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Antiviral testing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), the concentration of compound required for 50% antiviral activity, was determined on VeroE6 cells as follows. On day -1, the test compounds were serially diluted in 100 Î¼L assay medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% [vol/vol] FCS) in 96-well plates. In the next step, 50 Î¼L of VeroE6 cells (25,000 cells/well) was added together with 2 Î¼M the MDR1-inhibitor CP-100356 (final concentration 0.5âÎ¼M). The plates were incubated (37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 95% relative humidity) overnight. On day 0, 50 Î¼L of SARS-CoV-2 WT or the triple mutant strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per cell was added, and the plates were stored in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of antiviral activity, the VeroE6 cells underwent a cytopathic effect. Cell viability was determined 4âdays postinfection (p.i.) using viability staining with MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). The percentage of antiviral activity was calculated by subtracting the background and normalizing to the untreated-uninfected control wells, and the EC<sub>50</sub> was determined using logarithmic interpolation.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-4""><h3>Generation and rescue of recombinant viruses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We used the in-yeast transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning method as described previously with some adaptations (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). In sum, the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome was encoded in 12 overlapping DNA fragments. These so-called WU-fragments and a TAR-vector were homologously recombined in yeast, forming the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was encoded on WU-fragment 5 and was replaced with newly generated and overlapping PCR products to introduce the amino acid changes L50F, E166A L167F, or L50F E166A L167F. The overlapping PCR products were made via reverse transcription from RNA purified from viral RNA (vRNA) of the virus stock obtained from the selection. In brief, cDNA was generated from RNA by LunaScript RT SuperMix (NEB). PCRs targeting the 3CLpro gene were performed using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB), and the resulting PCR products were mixed and matched to recombine SARSCoV-2 3CLpro<sup>L50F</sup>, SARSCoV-2 3Clpro<sup>E166A L167F</sup>, and SARSCoV-2 3CLpro<sup>L50F E166A L167F</sup>. All PCR products were purified with the high pure PCR product purification kit (Roche) before being used for TAR cloning.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>In vitro</i> transcription was performed for EagI-cleaved YACs and the PCR-amplified SARS-CoV-2 N gene using the T7 RiboMAX large-scale RNA production system (Promega) as described previously (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Transcribed capped mRNA was electroporated into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells expressing SARS-CoV N protein. Electroporated cells were cocultured with susceptible Vero TMPRSS2 cells to produce passage 0 (P.0) of the recombinant viruses. Passage 1 virus stocks were further produced in Vero human transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cells, and the presence of mutations was confirmed by Illumina sequencing. These results also showed the absence of other nonsynonymous mutations in the viral genome.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>3CLpro cell-based reporter assay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The cell-based reporter assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymatic function was described previously (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). This gain-of-signal assay is based on the expression of a chimeric protein consisting of Src-Mpro-Tat-eGFP in which the Mpro amino acid sequence is flanked with cognate N- and C-terminal self-cleavage sites. While it was expected that Mpro inhibition would result in a different subcellular localization of the GFP signal, it was found that without Mpro inhibition, there is no detectable GFP expression, while in the presence of Mpro inhibition, there is high GFP expressionâhence, the name gain-of-signal assay. The exact mechanism behind this reporter system is not known, but results suggest a mechanism in which Mpro activity somehow suppresses the accumulation of reporter mRNA in transfected cells.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">293T cells were maintained at 37Â°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (Corning, cat. no. 10-013-CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, cat. no. 10091148) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, cat. no. 15140122). 293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5âÃâ10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and returned to incubation for 24 h. The following day, cells were treated with compound at a final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration of 2% prior to transfection with 100âng of the wild-type or triple mutant (L50F E166A L167F) plasmid with Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15338100) for 24 h. Then, 24 h posttransfection, GFP fluorescence was detected with a Victor device (Perkin Elmer) using the fluorescein 485/535 setting. Inhibition was determined from the resulting fluorescent signal and graphed using a variable slope four-parameter curve fitting with GraphPad Prism (v9.2.0).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3>3CLpro FRET-based assay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The FRET-based assay was performed similarly to the self-assembled monolayers for matrix-assisted desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI-MS) assay. Assays were performed in 20-Î¼L volume in 384-well nonbinding low-volume plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) at ambient temperature. 3CLpro and its mutants were preincubated with inhibitors for 30âmin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a FRET-compatible peptide substrate, dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH<sub>2</sub>. Fluorescence was measured for 90 min at 2-min intervals using 340/460-excitation/emission filters on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by fitting the curves using a four-parameter equation in GraphPad Prism.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">PDB structure <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6xhm/pdb"">6XHM</a> (complex with PF-00835231) was used as the starting point for modeling compounds in WT and mutant (L50F E166A L167F) 3CLpro. The receptor structure was cleaned up and minimized with restraints ahead of docking using the Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro (SchrÃ¶dinger). Ligands were processed using the Ligprep module in Maestro. Stereoisomers were not generated, as the absolute configuration of the ligand was known.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Covalent docking was used to predict the binding mode of ALG-097161. C145 was specified as the reactive residue for covalent binding, and the centroid of the X-ray reference ligand was used to define the investigated binding site. A custom covalent reaction parameter file was used to define the reaction between the warhead moiety and the catalytic C145. A high-accuracy (pose prediction thorough) docking methodology was implemented for pose prediction. Initial docking poses within 4âkcal/mol (glide gscore) were collected for further processing. Residues within 6âÃ of the bound compound were minimized after covalent bond formation. The top 5 binding mode suggestions were saved for visual inspection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Initial structures for the L50F E166A L167F triple mutant were built by introducing the mutations directly into the WT complex. An initial restrained minimization was done with the protein preparation wizard to remove any unacceptable clash. Next, a Desmond simulation system was built (see below) and a 100-ps energy minimization procedure was run with Desmond to reach the nearest energy minimum.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the Desmond-GPU package. A simulation system was first set up around the protein-inhibitor complex, including a 10-Ã water box, Na<sup>+</sup> ions necessary to neutralize the system, and additional Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>â</sup> ions to simulate a 0.15 M NaCl concentration. OPLS4 was selected as the force field. The NPT ensemble (temperature [<i>T</i>]â=â300 K, <i>P</i>â=â1.01325âbar) was used. The system was relaxed prior to simulation. MD simulations were run for a (simulated) period of 100âns, with frames saved every 0.25âns (total, 400 frames). The final frames were energy-minimized (100-ps minimization protocol). Protein-ligand interactions and distances were evaluated in the 5-ns to 100-ns period.</div></section></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Humans have been producing and consuming yogurt for several millennia as fermentation has historically been the only reliable method for preserving milk besides drying it. Fermented milk products can be found in almost every culture and have even been observed in Egyptian hieroglyphs (<a href=""#b1-jmbe-21-52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b1-jmbe-21-52"">1</a>). The earliest recorded references to the health benefits of consuming yogurt date back to Indian scripts from 6000 BC (<a href=""#b2-jmbe-21-52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b2-jmbe-21-52"">2</a>). Today, yogurt remains one of the most popular fermented dairy products worldwide, making up a 70-billion-dollar industry. Thus, yogurt making is often taught in microbiology laboratory courses as a way to introduce students to the basics of microbiology and its application in food preservation. Although students can produce yogurt, due to safety concerns, they are often not allowed to taste the yogurt they produce, which can lead to student dissatisfaction and lack of engagement with the laboratory procedure. Therefore, we designed a laboratory exercise in which students deconstruct commercially available yogurt to identify the two main bacteria present, <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>. Federal regulations require that anything sold as âyogurtâ contain only these two species of bacteria. The variety of textures and flavors that is achieved between the different commercially available yogurts is due to strain differences of these two bacterial species as well as differences in the way the yogurt is processed. This hands-on procedure introduces students to the basic concepts of food fermentation and allows them to practice many of the basic microbiology techniques they have been learning, while mitigating the safety concerns around food preparation in a laboratory setting.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""intro""><h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Due to the large nature of the microbiology classes at our institution (6 sections, ~24 students per section), finding an alternative space in which students could prepare yogurt had become untenable. Therefore, in order to still allow students to interact with microbes involved in the fermentation process, we created a laboratory exercise in which students were tasked with identifying the bacteria in commercially available, store-bought, yogurt. Prior to the beginning of these activities, students had received a lecture on the role of microorganisms in the fermentation of human foods, which included how yogurt and cheese were produced. At the end of these activities, which are designed to occur over the course of four days/lab periods, students will be able to 1) Gram stain and identify the bacterial species used in yogurt production, 2) collect and analyze results from MRS agar and phenol red broths to identify the bacterial species used in yogurt production, 3) provide the characteristics of bacterial species used in yogurt production, and 4) explain the role of bacteria and their metabolism in making yogurt.</div></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Students worked in pairs following the protocol provided in Appendix 1. A visual representation of the four days of tasks can be found in <a href=""#f1-jmbe-21-52"">Figure 1</a>. On the first day, a single container of CHOBANI Greek unflavored yogurt was provided to the class. On day 1, students were tasked with Gram staining the yogurt and streaking the yogurt on an MRS plate (Hardy Diagnostics). This agar was developed as an alternative non-selective medium for the cultivation of fastidious <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<a href=""#b3-jmbe-21-52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b3-jmbe-21-52"">3</a>). On day 2, students had to identify the two different types of bacteria on their MRS plates based on the provided colony morphology and choose one of each type to streak for isolation of colonies on new MRS plates. As the two bacterial species are not present in equal densities, the isolation of colonies is a challenging but attainable task for students. On day 3, students Gram stained each isolated bacterial type to confirm isolation and inoculated sucrose and glucose phenol red broths with Durham tubes. On day 4, students recorded the results of their phenol red broths and confirmed the identification of their two species of bacteria. During the lab, students record their results on the provided worksheet (Appendix 2). This worksheet also includes a number of questions for students to answer regarding the procedures and reagents used as well as the overall fermentation process that occurs in yogurt.</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">All work for these activities should be performed in a biosafety level 1 (BSL1) space and assumes students have had basic safety training in performing laboratory experiments with bacteria. Instructors should refer to the ASM BSL1 guidelines for laboratory space requirements, personal protection requirements, and standard laboratory practices. In particular, instructors should make sure that students have been instructed on safe use of Bunsen burners, the safe handling of bacteria, and the proper methods for disposing of biohazardous waste.</div></section><section id=""sec-4""><h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Students were assessed for their participation in the overall lab procedure, completion of the worksheet, and their laboratory skills (Gram staining, microscopy, aseptic technique, streaking for isolation, inoculating broths, and ability to identify their unknown bacteria). Although we did not include this in our assessments, student participation could be assessed during discussions in lab and/or the lecture portion of class. In general, the provided materials are meant as a guide, and we hope instructors will edit them to meet the needs of their classrooms. This laboratory procedure highlights the following ASM curriculum guidelines (<a href=""#b4-jmbe-21-52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b4-jmbe-21-52"">4</a>): âHumans utilize and harness microorganisms and their productsâ and âMicroorganisms and their environment interact with and modify each other.â Further, this laboratory procedure touches on almost all the core laboratory skills recommended by the ASM guidelines and can serve as an excellent end-of-year assessment of student learning (<a href=""#b4-jmbe-21-52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b4-jmbe-21-52"">4</a>).</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we present the complete genome sequence of a <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Providencia rettgeri</span> clinical isolate with a carbapenem-resistant antibiogram that is also resistant to ampicillin, aztreonam, cefazolin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin and tazobactam, and tetracycline. The isolate was collected from a urine sample from a hospitalized patient in Faulkner County, AK. Culturing of the urine sample on a blood agar plate yielded <i>P. rettgeri</i>, which was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâtime of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Biotyper; Bruker Daltonics, USA). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Vitek 2 system (bioMÃ©rieux) with the AST-GN card. Detection of carbapenemase production was negative based on the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>), following the CLSI guidelines (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Culture samples of this strain were submitted to the Arkansas Department of Health directly. Therefore, there was no direct contact with the study participant. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) classified this study as exempt (IRB No. 261022).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Genomic DNA was extracted, purified, and sequenced as described in references <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a> and <a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted using pure colonies of <i>P. rettgeri</i> subcultured for 24âh on blood agar plates. The colonies were resuspended into a DNA/RNA Shield collection and lysis tube. Then, genomic DNA was extracted using the Quick-DNA fungal/bacterial kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and further purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). The DNA concentration was quantified and quality controlled using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system, and a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified DNA was aliquoted into two tubes for MinION and Illumina sequencing.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">An Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing library was prepared using a PCR-free method of multiplexing samples with the rapid barcoding kit (SQK-RAD004); the library was sequenced using a FLO-MIN106 (R9.4) flow cell for 48âh. The short-read sequencing library was sequenced using the DNBSEQ-G400 platform at BGI Genomics (San Jose, CA), where they followed their standard protocol to construct DNA libraries of 2âÃâ150-bp paired-end reads. Reads with adapter contamination and low-quality reads with a base quality score of &lt;Q20 were filtered out using SOAPnuke software (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Adapter sequences were trimmed from the short paired-end reads using fastp v0.23.2 (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). The quality of the pre- and postprocessed reads was assessed using the FastQC tool v0.11.9 (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Long-read base calling and demultiplexing were conducted using the model dna_r9.4.1_450bps in Guppy v4.5.4 (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), with min_qscore set to 9. Adapters were trimmed from the Nanopore long reads using Porechop v0.2.4 (<a href=""https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop"">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</a>). Nanopore read quality control was performed using NanoFilt v2.3 and NanoStat v1.5.0 from NanoPack (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). A <i>de novo</i> hybrid assembly was built using Unicycler v0.4.8 (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>), with the ONT long reads and paired-end short reads as the input, which resulted in one circular chromosome without any identified plasmids. The absence of plasmid replicons was further confirmed using the KMA algorithm in PlasmidFinder v2.0.1 against the <i>Enterobacterales</i> plasmid database v2021-11-29 (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Default parameters were used for all software unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The complete circular chromosome was rotated with Unicycler, using the <i>dnaA</i> gene as the starting gene, and annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) v5.3 (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). A BLAST alignment of the seven complete 16S rRNA genes (1,528âbp) identified in isolate PROV_UAMS_01 against the NCBI nonredundant/nucleotide (nr/nt) database showed 99.93 to 100% sequence similarity with the 16S rRNA genes from other <i>P. rettgeri</i> strains. Assignment of PROV_UAMS_01 to the species <i>P. rettgeri</i> was further confirmed as in reference <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a> using Mash v2.3 (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>) to calculate the genomic distance of isolate PROV_UAMS_01 against a local database of all <i>Providencia</i> genomes available in GenBank (220 genomes as of 13 March 2021). A summary of the whole-genome sequencing data and the main genomic features of isolate PROV_UAMS_01 are listed in <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">We read with interest the publication by NougayrÃ¨de and coworkers who described that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is mutagenic by means of its expressed colibactin (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The contribution of this work on the biological activity of colibactin is of high significance and increases our knowledge on this enigmatic toxin. The use of mouse models is an important methodology to study the effect of colibactin <i>in vivo.</i> NougayrÃ¨de et al. provided evidence that EcN has genotoxic potential in the models they applied (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The topic of colibactin is of extreme importance to our company, as patient and consumer safety has our utmost priority: the use of probiotic products that contain EcN as an active ingredient should not have health risks. That has been the basis of our companyâs strategy in the past, and it remains our focus in the present and future. For this reason, databases on drug side effects, such as EudraVigilance (the European database of suspected adverse drug reaction reports, <a href=""http://www.adrreports.eu"">www.adrreports.eu</a>) are closely being monitored. So far, these show no evidence of a potential cancer risk from intake of EcN.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">As this matter is of high concern to us, we had conducted genotoxicity tests that are compliant with FDA Recommendations (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>) and OECD Guidelines (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). These guidelines have been defined to detect genotoxicity of a given compound, and commercial companies are obliged to follow such guidelines. This included use of the Ames test, performed according to the original test protocol and additionally with slight modification for testing live EcN bacteria (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). No mutagenic or cytotoxic effect of live EcN or its metabolites were found with these tests (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Needless to say, tests were performed according to good manufacturing practicing (GMP) standards with inclusion of all appropriate controls. These controls identified that the number of spontaneous revertants in the Ames test were in accordance with the frequency range reported in the literature and with in-house historical data. Compared to this control, the presence of EcN did not raise the number of revertant colonies of the Ames strains and it did not reduce the number of the Ames strain colonies by killing them, a conclusion that was unfortunately inaccurately drawn from our work by NougayrÃ¨de and colleagues (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The background lawns obtained in the Ames tests indicated the absence of any cytotoxic effect by EcN, an observation that we possibly did not point out clearly enough in our publication (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). We observed a background lawn of the EcN samples that in all cases was identical to that of the H<sub>2</sub>O control. Thus, a possible killing effect by microcins or any other antagonistic influence of EcN on the used <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Salmonella</span> Ames reporter strains can safely be excluded.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The second OECD-approved technique we used was the <i>in vivo</i> mammalian alkaline comet assay using rats, which is also recommended by the FDA (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>) for detection of DNA strand breaks. In contrast, NougayrÃ¨de et al. used two alternative mouse models (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). One model utilized axenic mice that were monoassociated once with EcN and sacrificed 7 days later. Their second model used 8-day-old mouse pups that were sacrificed only 6 h after a single exposure to EcN. Colon tissue from animals of both models was assessed immunohistologically for the presence of histone Î³H2AX. In the rodent model we used, 7- to 9-week-old SPF rats were fed EcN daily for 2 days or 28 days. Despite this much longer exposure, histological examination and comet assay of the specified gut tissue did not detect any mutagenic effect of EcN (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). As mentioned above, the comet assay is highly appropriate in light of the proposed activity of colibactin to induce DNA strand breaks. We point out that Pharmaceutical Marketing Authorisation Holders are expected to use standardized, guideline-defined tests for comparison of obtained data. The comet assay did not display any genotoxic activity of EcN (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), but that does not make the assay âinappropriateâ as expressed by NougayrÃ¨de et al. The contradictory data obtained with the different animal models can be caused by multiple factors, including the presence or absence of a matured immune system, a natural microbiota, and an intact intestinal barrier, all of which most likely reduce the direct cell-cell contact that is considered essential for the action of colibactin (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This is not to say that we are not concerned about the genotoxic potential of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, including EcN, that has been demonstrated by alternative tests, as this potentially points toward a negative impact on human health and a role of colibactin in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). As NougayrÃ¨de and colleagues (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>) correctly stated, EcN is administered to infants. In this context, we draw attention to a recent publication describing natural mother-to-infant transmission of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> strains in newborns (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Those authors concluded that âa respectable number of healthy individuals may become predisposed to a high risk of CRC at the very early stage of lifeâ. We can confirm that <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> bacteria are common in infants, based on as yet unpublished data. In a randomized controlled trial (unpublished data), EcN or placebo was given to newborns and again at the age of 1âyear. A year later, stool samples were analyzed for the presence of <i>pks</i> by PCR, and <i>pks</i> was found in approximately 40% of infants in both groups. The incidence of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> in a general population has been estimated between 16% and 48% (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a><a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">â</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), assuming that all phylotype B2 <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> strains contain the <i>pks</i> locus.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Numerous studies have demonstrated that CRC patients are more often colonized by phylotype B2 <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> (e.g., reference <a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>), and an overrepresentation of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> was also demonstrated (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). A molecular signature of DNA damage that could be attributed to colibactin activity was demonstrated in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data obtained from CRC tumors (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). However, this applied to only 5% of the investigated WGS data (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). If infants are already frequently colonized by <i>pks</i>-bearing strains, if these strains are persistent over time, and if they are able to induce colorectal cancer later in life, it needs to be explained why only such a relatively small fraction of CRC tumors bear this signature. This paradox has also been noticed by others, suggesting that the presence of commensal <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup> bacteria alone is likely insufficient for cancer development and such bacteria exert a carcinogenic influence only under specific conditions (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). The genotoxic activity of colibactin is observed only following direct cell-cell contact (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>), plus the transcriptional activation of all <i>clb</i> genes of the <i>pks</i> island seems to be required (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). The direct cell-cell contact of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup> strains with host epithelium cells is not only hampered by presence of mucus in the gut (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), but the intestinal barrier is even enhanced by EcNâs ability to promote mucus production and to seal the tight junctions (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Transcriptional regulation of <i>clb</i> genes is influenced by many factors (e.g., metabolites), and transcription of several <i>clb</i> components is promoted by inflammation (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>), but EcN is known to be anti-inflammatory by modulating the host immune system in multiple ways (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Beside the discussed genotoxic potential of <i>pks</i><sup>+</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, there are other, host-derived biological impacts in humans. Obviously, the onset of CRC is multifactorial, to which genetic factors and diet also contribute. Additionally, DNA damage repair responses play an important role (reviewed in, for example, references <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a> and <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). It is therefore relevant to consider the possibility that most of the DNA damage induced by colibactin would be repaired or would generally result in apoptosis. Moreover, chronic inflammation is a known trigger of CRC. EcN reduces the risk of colitis-associated CRC, as demonstrated in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, who maintained in remission by intake of EcN, due to its anti-inflammatory activity that is similar in potency to mesalazine (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). In addition, by means of microcin expression, EcN limits the presence of pro-inflammatory species of the family <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Moreover, EcN did not increase microsatellite instability in UC patients (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">It is not our intention to downplay the important findings reported by NougayrÃ¨de and coworkers (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>) in any way. We just want to point out that the biological relevance of their findings, generated by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> (murine) models, may not paint a complete picture of the intricate relationship between the human host and its natural gut microflora, or a microflora influenced by intake of probiotic bacteria. While we and others continue our research to elucidate this, we remain vigilant to react quickly in case evidence emerges that would suggest our EcN-based probiotic products would harm consumers.</div></section></div></section>"

<div role=""paragraph"">The genus <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> contains Gram-negative, aerobic marine bacteria, including both nonpigmented and pigmented species (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Agar-degrading marine bacteria such as <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> spp. that produce different types of agarases have been reported previously (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>).

However, the genome sequence of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> sp. S89 has not yet been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to sequence the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> sp.

<div role=""paragraph"">We isolated and identified <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> sp.

Whole assembled reads could be divided into two groups of contigs, including 57 large contigs (length of &gt;500 bp) and 65 small contigs (length of &gt;100 bp). The average contig size was 67,767 bp. The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Alteromonas</span> sp.

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01958-13","<div role=""paragraph"">DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils in the genomes of eubacteria. Fluoroquinolones (FQs), successful as drugs clinically, target the enzyme to trap the gyrase-DNA complex, leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in the genome. Mycobacteria are less susceptible to commonly used FQs. However, an 8-methoxy-substituted FQ, moxifloxacin (MFX), is a potent antimycobacterial, and a higher susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to MFX has been demonstrated. Although several models explain the mechanism of FQ action and gyrase-DNA-FQ interaction, the basis for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to various FQs is not understood. We have addressed the basis of the differential susceptibility of the gyrase and revisited the mode of action of FQs. We demonstrate that FQs bind both <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> gyrases in the absence of DNA and that the addition of DNA enhances the drug binding.

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme responsible for the maintenance of DNA topology in eubacteria. The enzyme catalyzes ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of relaxed circular DNA (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). It is composed of two GyrA and two GyrB subunits resulting in a heterotetrameric holoenzyme. Negative supercoiling by DNA gyrase involves a series of sequential events. The enzyme cleaves duplex DNA through which another segment of the same DNA molecule is transferred. The cleaved DNA is resealed followed by the release of substrate DNA, completing one round of DNA supercoiling (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Owing to its indispensability for bacterial survival and its absence in mammals, gyrase has been a much sought-after drug target, culminating in the characterization of a number of inhibitors with diverse mechanisms of action. Among them, coumarins (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>) and cyclothialidines (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) inhibit ATPase activity, and quinolones (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), CcdB (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), and microcin B17 (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>) arrest the gyrase-DNA covalent complex. Several other compounds inhibit the enzyme activity (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11 B12 B13 B14"">â</a><a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). Among all of these molecules, fluorine substituted quinolones (FQs) act as bactericidal agents by poisoning the gyrase-DNA complex. Arrest of gyrase-DNA covalent complex leads to the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks, triggering the activation of SOS pathways, depletion of reducing equivalents, and generation of reactive oxygen intermediates causing cell death (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Due to this potent bactericidal effect, FQs are used for the treatment of a wide range of bacterial infections (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Among all bacterial infections, tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a major global challenge. The treatment of TB includes a combination of several drugs. FQs are now used to treat infection caused by rifampin-resistant tubercle bacilli (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). Although DNA gyrase from many pathogens is inhibited by FQs, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> showed a lower susceptibility to the commonly used FQs, e.g., ciprofloxacin (CFX) and ofloxacin (OFX) (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). However, newer-generation FQs, moxifloxacin (MFX) and gatifloxacin (GFX), showed higher activity against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span>. The studies with purified enzymes showed that MFX is a better inhibitor of both <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrases (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>; our unpublished results).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We sought here to understand the differential FQ susceptibility of gyrases from mycobacteria to explain why MFX inhibits the enzymes at a lower concentration than CFX. While investigating the basis for differential FQ susceptibility, we revisited the mechanism of action of the FQs. Although the FQs were initially suggested to be interacting with DNA (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>), the interaction with both DNA and the enzyme was apparent from subsequent studies (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a><a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24 B25 B26"">â</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). Now, we provide a further insight into the mechanism of FQ action. We demonstrate the direct binding of the FQs to the enzyme, in addition to the gyrase-DNA complex. The differential susceptibility seems to be governed by the differences in the interaction pattern of the FQs with the enzyme. Surprisingly, we found that FQs bind primarily to GyrA of mycobacterial gyrases, a mode of interaction distinct from that of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> gyrase.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">The open reading frame (ORF) encoding GyrA was cloned in pET20b, and the subunit was overexpressed in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> BL21/pLysS strain (induction with 0.3 mM IPTG at an <i>A</i><sub>595</sub> of 0.8 for 3 h at 25Â°C). The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The cells were lysed, and the S100 supernatant was subjected to 55% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a Hi-Trap heparin column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient of 200 to 700 mM NaCl. The fractions containing GyrA were dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a Hi-Trap MonoQ column (GE Healthcare). Elution was carried out by using a linear gradient of 300 to 800 mM NaCl. The fractions containing GyrA were dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a Hi-Trap SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), followed by elution with 200 to 800 mM NaCl. The fractions were dialyzed against buffer A, followed by buffer B (100 mM KCl, Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% [vol/vol] glycerol), and then stored at â70Â°C. The ORF encoding GyrB was cloned in pET20b, and overexpression was carried out using similar parameters.

The protein fractions were dialyzed against buffer A, followed by buffer B and stored at â70Â°C. The holoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing the GyrA and GyrB subunits in a 1:2 GyrA/GyrB molar ratio.

Plasmid and oligonucleotide cleavage experiments were carried out using the methods described earlier (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). A total of 200 ng of pUC18 plasmid and 100 nM <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase were incubated in the reaction buffer at 37Â°C for 30 min, followed by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to a final concentration of 0.1% and 10 Î¼g of proteinase K/ml. The incubation was continued for another 30 min. For oligonucleotide cleavage experiments, 5â²-Î³-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled 143-bp DNA and DNA gyrase from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> or <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> were used.

The trapped enzyme-DNA complexes were resolved by using 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with a phosphorimager (FLA 5000; GE Healthcare). The fold increase in the formation of enzyme-DNA complex in the presence of FQs was calculated with respect to the complex formed in the absence of the drug.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Fluorescence measurements.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Hitachi-7000 spectrofluorimeter fitted with a polarizer. All of the fluorescence measurements were taken using a slit width of 10 mm, a PMT voltage of 700 V, and an integration time of 0.1 s. The assays were carried out at specific excitation/emission wavelengths of 335/470 nm (for MFX) and 327/420 nm (for CFX), respectively. Fluorescence anisotropy titrations (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>) were carried out at fixed concentrations of the FQs and with increasing concentrations of DNA gyrase from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, and Topo IV from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> or their subunits (as specified in the figure legends) in a binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, and 2 mM dithiothreitol at 37Â°C. For DNase I-proteinase K treatment, the reactions without FQs were incubated with 10 Î¼g of proteinase K/ml or 10 U of DNase I for 6 h, followed by the addition of the FQs. For FQ-DNA binding experiments, increasing concentrations of salmon sperm DNA were added to 10 nM CFX or MFX. To monitor the binding of FQs to preformed enzyme-DNA complex, 200 nM <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase was preincubated with salmon sperm DNA (200 bp/holoenzyme, 4Â°C, 10 min). Incubations were continued at 37Â°C for 10 min after the addition of 10 nM CFX or MFX. The binding of the FQs to the D94G mutant of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> GyrA or the holoenzyme was carried out by incubating 50 nM GyrA or the holoenzyme with 10 nM CFX/MFX at 37Â°C for 10 min. The equations used to calculate anisotropy are given in Table S1 in the supplemental material. In the fluorescence-quenching experiments to monitor the drug-gyrase interaction, a 50 nM concentration of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase was incubated with various concentrations (100 to 800 nM) of CFX or MFX. The ratio of change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (excitation, 295 nm; emission, 340 nm) at a given drug concentration (Î<i>F</i>) and the change at infinite concentrations of the drug (Î<i>F</i><sub>max</sub>) were plotted against the drug concentration (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). The plot was fitted and analyzed by the Hill binding equation in GraphPad Prism 5.

<section id=""sec-3-1""><h3>DNA cleavage in the presence of FQs.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Although CFX and OFX are widely used FQs for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections, several studies showed their lower efficacy against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a><a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35 B36"">â</a><a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). However, the FQs with methoxy substitution at C-8 (MFX and GFX) exhibited potent antimycobacterial activity (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>) and also inhibited mycobacterial DNA gyrase at low concentrations (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>; unpublished results). The DNA supercoiling reaction catalyzed by gyrase involves two sequential transesterification reactions and an intermediate strand passage step to pass the intact duplex DNA through the cleaved DNA (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). The FQs trap the covalent complex formed by gyrase with DNA during the first trans-esterification reaction, converting the enzyme into a double-strand cleaving endonuclease (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). To analyze the basis of the differential susceptibility of the mycobacterial gyrase to the FQs, DNA cleavage experiments were carried out with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase. The cleavage induced by MFX or GFX was two to three times more than with CFX or OFX (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1A</a>). A similar pattern was observed with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> DNA gyrase (data not shown). These results are consistent with the results obtained in DNA supercoiling assays where 2- to 3-fold-higher inhibition was seen with MFX (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). The increased cleavage seen in the presence of MFX could be due to increased complex formation between the DNA and the enzyme in the presence of the compound. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out to assess the extent of complex formation in the presence of the two FQs by incubating 5â²-end-labeled 72-bp DNA with the enzyme and 25 nM CFX or MFX. An increase in the enzyme-DNA complex was seen, indicating the formation of an FQ stabilized complex. Importantly, the extent of complex formation was 2-fold more with MFX than with CFX (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1B</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F1"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Earlier studies indicated that quinolones and FQs induce a different cleavage pattern by the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> DNA gyrase (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). However, the differential interaction of two FQs with a given gyrase has not been investigated. The FQs interact with the enzyme-DNA complex near the active site (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). Due to the differences in their chemical nature, the interaction with the FQs may involve different residues. The difference in the extent of complex formation and DNA cleavage seen in the presence of CFX and MFX may arise due to differences in their interaction. To evaluate whether this difference is also associated with a distinct cleavage pattern, assays were carried out with a linear DNA fragment labeled at the 5â² end. In the presence of CFX, three cleaved DNA fragments were seen, whereas MFX-induced cleavage resulted in an additional DNA fragment (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2A</a>). In contrast, the cleavage pattern was similar in the presence of both CFX and MFX with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). To investigate whether the interaction of CFX and MFX with the mycobacterial gyrase occurs at the same site, cleavage competition assays were carried out using a fixed concentration of one FQ and increasing the concentration of the other. Increasing the concentration of MFX led to the appearance of the MFX-specific cleavage product, whereas it gradually disappeared with an increase in CFX concentration (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2B</a>). From these data, it is evident that these two FQs compete to the same binding site and, when bound, induce their respective characteristic cleavage patterns.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-3-2""><h3>Interaction of the FQs with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To understand the basis of the differential interaction of CFX and MFX with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase and to evaluate the mechanism of action of the FQs, fluorescence anisotropy assays were carried out. The technique provides a sensitive and real-time measurement of the molecular interactions occurring in solution. The interaction of small fluorescent ligands with larger receptor protein molecules can be conveniently monitored by this technique (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). Many FQs are intrinsically fluorescent enabling the measurement of their interaction with the gyrase and/or DNA by a change in anisotropy. Initially, a set of control experiments were carried out before monitoring the interaction of the FQs with the enzyme-DNA complex. A 10 nM concentration of CFX or MFX was titrated with a range of enzyme concentrations. Surprisingly, a concentration-dependent increase in anisotropy was observed in these control experiments, which had only FQ and the enzyme. The binding of the FQs to the enzyme reached saturation at higher concentrations of the enzyme (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3A</a>). Notably, MFX binding induced significantly higher changes in anisotropy compared to CFX (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3A</a>). In experiments with 20 and 50 nM concentrations, the FQs also showed a similar pattern of interaction (data not shown).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F3"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A number of previous studies had shown the requirement of DNA for gyrase-FQ interaction (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a><a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">â</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). Moreover, the binding of FQs on their own to the enzyme was not apparent in these studies. Thus, to rule out the possibility that enzyme preparations contained contaminating DNA which could have contributed to the observed drug binding to the enzyme, the following experiments were carried out. First, the enzyme was treated with DNase I over an extended period of time (see Materials and Methods) before carrying out fluorescence measurements. The binding of both CFX and MFX to the enzyme remained unaltered (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3B</a>). In another important control experiment, the enzyme was subjected to proteinase K treatment before the measurements. In the latter case, the change in anisotropy was negligible, indicating that in the experimental conditions used, the FQs bind to the enzyme directly (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3A</a>). Next, to monitor the role of DNA in FQ-gyrase interactions, CFX or MFX were incubated with gyrase-DNA complex as described in Materials and Methods, which resulted in altered interactions, as seen by changes in anisotropy (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3C</a>). However, similar to the pattern seen with free enzyme, the interaction of MFX with the enzyme-DNA complex was better than CFX. Fluorescence-quenching and spin column gel filtration experiments indicated that MFX bound <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase better than CFX (see Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material). When the binding of DNA alone to FQs was monitored in a separate experiment, surprisingly, a much lower change in anisotropy was observed (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). The implications of these findings are elaborated in the later part of the manuscript.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Although the experiments with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> enzyme described above showed a direct interaction between FQs and the gyrase, in the case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase FQ binding required the enzyme-DNA complex (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a><a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24 B25 B26"">â</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). To examine whether the DNA gyrases from two different bacteria do indeed exhibit different interaction patterns with the FQs, we carried out assays with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme. Anisotropic changes were seen when the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase was incubated with either of the FQs (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4A</a>). However, in contrast to the pattern seen in case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase, the binding of both the FQs to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme seems to be comparable (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4A</a>). The binding was remarkably poor in the case of OXO (data not shown), a weaker inhibitor of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Most importantly, prior digestion of the enzyme samples with the DNase I, similar to the experiments with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> enzyme, did not affect the binding of the FQs to the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4B</a>). However, with the proteinase K treatment to the enzyme, the binding of FQs was nearly abolished (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4A</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Although, from these studies, it is evident that FQs can bind directly to DNA gyrase holoenzymes from two different species, they do not reveal whether the drugs preferentially bind to only one of the subunits, or whether the assembled tetrameric holoenzyme is necessary for binding. To determine whether the FQs bind only to the holoenzyme or also to individual subunits, fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out with individual subunits of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase. From the data shown in <a href=""#F5"">Fig 5A</a>, it is evident that both FQs can bind to the GyrA subunit itself to an extent similar to that of the holoenzyme. Notably, the GyrA interaction with MFX seems to be markedly higher than to CFX (<a href=""#F5"">Fig. 5A</a>); a low degree of binding of GyrB to FQs is seen (<a href=""#F5"">Fig. 5A</a>). Together, these results imply that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> GyrA is primarily involved in interaction with the FQs, and the contribution from GyrB alone or GyrB in complex with GyrA, i.e., in the holoenzyme context, appears to be minimal. Interestingly, in the experiments with individual subunits of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase, we observed different results; the binding of either the GyrA or GyrB subunits of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme was substantially lower, and only the assembled holoenzyme was competent for both CFX/MFX binding (<a href=""#F5"">Fig. 5B</a>). These results are in contrast to those of an earlier study in which <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> GyrA was shown to interact with CFX (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>). FQ binding experiments were also carried out with Topo IV, another type II topoisomerase present in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> and its subunits ParC and ParE. Topo IV alone could bind to CFX and MFX in the absence of DNA; similar to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase subunits, the individual subunits of topo IV showed low degree of interaction with the FQs (see Fig. S4A and B in the supplemental material).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">From the above-described experiments, it is apparent that CFX and MFX show a difference in the interaction with the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase, which explains the basis for their different inhibition potential. One of the most likely reasons for the FQ resistance acquired upon mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) would be the weaker interaction of the FQs with the enzyme. To investigate whether a mutation in QRDR affects FQ-enzyme interaction, we chose one of the most common QRDR mutants. Among all QRDR mutations, serine 83 (S83) and aspartate 87 (D87) mutations in the GyrA subunit are most common in gyrases from various bacteria. Indeed, a mutation in D94 (corresponding to D87 in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> GyrA [see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material]) confers FQ resistance to both the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> and the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> DNA gyrase (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). Fluorescence anisotropy experiments showed a substantially weaker binding of FQs with either D94G GyrA alone or the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> holoenzyme containing D94G GyrA (<a href=""#F6"">Fig. 6</a>). However, the binding of CFX and MFX to the wild-type <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. smegmatis</span> GyrA or holoenzyme was similar to the results obtained with GyrA or the holoenzyme from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span>.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">By virtue of their ability to trap the gyrase-DNA covalent complex, leading to the generation of double-strand breaks in the genome, FQs have been subjected to intensive studies in order to find more effective derivatives (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23 B24 B25"">â</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). As a result, a number of new FQs with varied inhibitory potency against different bacteria have been characterized (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). In parallel, their mechanism of action has been also studied extensively to develop molecules with improved ability to induce double-strand cleavage. Initial efforts in understanding the mechanism involved ultrafiltration and equilibrium dialysis methods in order to monitor the enzyme and DNA interaction with [<sup>3</sup>H]norfloxacin. A strong binding of the drug to DNA, but an insignificant binding to the enzyme, was reported (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). In addition, the drug was shown to preferentially bind to the single-stranded DNA. Next, the DNA binding was shown to be dependent on the concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Subsequent surface plasmon resonance studies on FQ-DNA interaction using single-stranded DNA showed a sequence-dependent binding with high affinity, whereas double-stranded DNA binding seemed to be sequence independent (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). In a separate study, the binding of norfloxacin to unique sites in the enzyme-DNA complex was observed, implicating the interaction of the FQs with both the gyrase and DNA (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The interaction of the FQs with the enzyme-DNA complex was established by several other studies (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a><a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24 B25 B26"">â</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). However, in these studies, the direct binding of FQs to the enzyme itself was not apparent, and the basis for the varied FQ susceptibility of gyrases from different bacteria and the occurrence of a large number of quinolone-resistance mutations were unexplained to a large extent. In a recent study, however, the contribution of a water-metal ion bridge for Topo IV-quinolone interaction and its stabilization by two amino acid residues of the QRDR has been demonstrated (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In order to address the problem and to account for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrases to FQs, we revisited the mechanism of FQ-gyrase interaction. We found two distinct ways in which the interaction of FQs with the enzyme is achieved. In the established mode known for more than a decade, FQs bind to the enzyme-DNA complex prior or after DNA cleavage (<a href=""#F7"">Fig. 7</a>) (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). We described the binding of the enzyme to FQ before the binding to DNA, a mode of interaction indicated in an earlier work with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>). Moreover, from our studies, it appears that the binding of the drug to DNA is unlikely to be a major mechanism of drug action under physiological conditions. However, to investigate whether FQs bind DNA, we carried out experiments using the conditions described in earlier studies (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). When 25 mM KCl was used to monitor the interaction, the binding of CFX/MFX to DNA was seen as reported earlier (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material) (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). However, binding of FQs to the enzyme alone was also observed, and binding of the drug to the enzyme-DNA complex was greater than the FQ binding to either the enzyme or DNA. Importantly, in assays where the salt concentration used was close to physiological levels, FQs exhibited a weak DNA-binding ability (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material); the FQs bound the enzyme alone, as well the enzyme-DNA complex (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3A</a> and <a href=""#F3"">C</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F7"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The binding of the FQs to the enzyme-DNA complex has been investigated extensively; the drugs may bind to the gyrase-DNA complex and induce the cleavage of the DNA. Alternatively, or additionally the drugs may bind to the gyrase-DNA covalent complex and stabilize the cleaved complex (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>; summarized in <a href=""#F7"">Fig. 7</a>). The net outcome of both the pathways is the accumulation of cleaved ternary complexes. The direct binding of FQ to the enzyme described here is likely to be an earlier step in the reaction (<a href=""#F7"">Fig. 7</a>; see also Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Normally, much of the DNA gyrase holoenzyme would be bound to the DNA to carry out the supercoiling function <i>in vivo</i>. However, some free subunits and holoenzymes generated due to dissociation from the DNA and continuous protein synthesis during the exponential phase of growth would be available for FQ binding. In one scenario, such FQ-gyrase complexes may occlude DNA binding, resulting in an inhibition of activity similar to the mechanism of inhibition observed with endogenous gyrase inhibitory proteins (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a><a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">â</a><a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). A number of them directly bind to the gyrase and sequester the enzyme away from DNA, accounting for the phenotypic resistance against FQs (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a><a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">â</a><a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). However, in contrast, we did see that the enzyme-FQ complex has also the ability to bind DNA (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material), thus confining the inhibition mechanism to the established mode <i>viz.</i> double-stranded cleavage in the ternary complex (<a href=""#F7"">Fig. 7</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The direct binding of FQs to either the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> holoenzyme or the GyrA of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> gyrase seems to account for the differential susceptibility seen with different drugs. The better binding of MFX to the GyrA of the latter enzyme seems to directly correlate to increased ternary complex formation and cleaved products. It also accounts for the higher inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the enzyme seen with MFX earlier (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). The similar interaction of both CFX and MFX to the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase correlates well with the comparable DNA cleavage seen in the presence of the drugs (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In support of this, the inhibition of the supercoiling activity of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> enzyme was comparable to both CFX and MFX (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). Similarly, OXO, a weak inhibitor of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> gyrase (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), demonstrated less binding (data not shown). Further, the findings presented here can account for the occurrence of a large number of FQ-resistant mutations in the QRDR of both GyrA and GyrB subunits, conferring various degrees of resistance. Given that the primary QRDR resides in the amino terminus of the GyrA subunit, mutations in the GyrA subunit result in high-level resistance, whereas those in GyrB tend to result in low-level resistance (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>, <a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). However, the frequency of the occurrence of mutations in the two genes seems to be highly varied in different organisms. For example, in a study analyzing the FQ resistance in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span>, 711 of 806 FQ-resistant strains were found to contain a single-site mutation in the gyrase genes. Among these single site mutants, 97% (691/711) isolates contained mutations in <i>gyrA</i> and only 2.8% (20/711) in <i>gyrB</i>. In addition, among 109 isolates containing more than one mutation in the <i>gyr</i> locus, 103 isolates had multiple mutations in <i>gyrA</i> and only one isolate contained a double mutation in <i>gyrB</i> (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>). In contrast, such a bias in mutation frequency is not seen in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, where out of 25 spontaneous FQ-resistant strains selected <i>in vitro</i>, 13 had mutations in <i>gyrA</i> and the rest mapped to <i>gyrB</i> (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). Thus, the binding pattern of the FQs to the two gyrases seems to correlate well with the distribution of the resistance mutations. However, in the laboratory-conducted experiments, the mutation frequency in the particular allele (<i>gyrA</i> or <i>gyrB</i>) is dependent on the drug, its concentration chosen for the study, and a number of other variables (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Structural studies of the gyrase/Topo IV-DNA complex and FQs have been carried out with the objective of visualizing the molecular interactions in the ternary complex. In the structure of FQ-trapped <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> Topo IV, two FQ molecules were shown to interact with the cleaved DNA, preventing the 3â²-OH group from attacking the phosphotyrosine for religation (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), while the structure of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Acinetobacter baumannii</span> Topo IV-DNA complex trapped with MFX showed Mg<sup>2+</sup> bridged protein-FQ contact (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). The mutation of the residues involved in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bridged contact with FQs reduced the interaction (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), establishing the importance of the FQs binding to the enzyme-DNA complex for efficient inhibition. Given the high degree of similarity between the gyrase and Topo IV in the amino-terminal regions of GyrA and ParC, one would expect a similar interaction pattern between the gyrase and FQ. However, CFX bound to the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Staphylococcus aureus</span> gyrase-DNA complex showed a different orientation of the drug compared to the MFX-Topo IV complex (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The docking of MFX on the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> DNA gyrase reaction core along with DNA indicated that the drug contacts both subunits in the enzyme-DNA complex (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>). However, the overwhelming incidence of QRDR mutations mapping to the GyrA of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>) is an indication of a major role for GyrA in FQ binding. The GyrB binding shown in the docking model (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>) may have a role in stabilizing the interaction in the ternary complex.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, the binding of FQs to the enzyme itself and the enzyme-DNA complex may have physiological implications in the development of resistance and also account for the differential susceptibility of the enzyme to different FQs. The frequency of distribution of mutations in GyrA and GyrB seems to indicate whether a given FQ preferentially binds to one of the subunits or the holoenzyme from different bacteria. The high-affinity binding of the FQs to the gyrase itself, demonstrated here, may open up avenues for structural studies of the complex between the drug and the enzyme, paving the way for the generation of more potent lead molecules against a variety of bacterial infections.</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01517-21","<div role=""paragraph"">Ebolaviruses Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) cause fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates. While the host response to EBOV is well characterized, less is known about BDBV infection. Moreover, immune signatures that mediate natural protection against all ebolaviruses remain poorly defined. To explore these knowledge gaps, we transcriptionally profiled BDBV-infected rhesus macaques, a disease model that results in incomplete lethality. This approach enabled us to identify prognostic indicators. As expected, survival (â¼60%) correlated with reduced clinical pathology and circulating infectious virus, although peak viral RNA loads were not significantly different between surviving and nonsurviving macaques. Survivors had higher anti-BDBV antibody titers and transcriptionally derived cytotoxic T cell-, memory B cell-, and plasma cell-type quantities, demonstrating activation of adaptive immunity. Conversely, a poor prognosis was associated with lack of an appropriate adaptive response, sustained innate immune signaling, and higher expression of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-related transcripts (<i>S100A8</i>, <i>S100A9</i>, <i>CEBPB</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>CXCR1</i>, and <i>LILRA3</i>). MDSCs are potent immunosuppressors of cellular and humoral immunity, and therefore, they represent a potential therapeutic target. Circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) levels were also elevated in nonsurvivors and in survivors exhibiting severe illness, emphasizing the importance of maintaining coagulation homeostasis to control disease progression.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>Ebolavirus</i> genus comprises six species: <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i>, <i>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</i>, <i>Sudan ebolavirus</i>, <i>Tai Forest ebolavirus</i>, <i>Reston ebolavirus</i>, and the recently discovered <i>Bombali ebolaviru</i>s (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The ongoing outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV; species <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i>) in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea demonstrate that ebolaviruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Clinical manifestations of ebolavirus-infected humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) are similar, including high viremia, hypercytokinemia, and consumptive coagulopathy, which may progress to septic shock and multiorgan failure (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). The virus initially replicates in monocytes and dendritic cells and then spreads to hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Bundibugyo virus (BDBV; species <i>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</i>) is considered a less pathogenic ebolavirus due to its reduced lethality during human outbreaks (25 to 51%), as well as in experimentally infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">â</a><a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). In contrast, infection of NHPs with EBOV results in nearly uniform lethality (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). While in-depth transcriptome analyses have been performed on samples from EBOV-infected human patients and NHPs, no such studies exist for BDBV (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15"">â</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). As macaques are incompletely protected against BDBV disease, we reasoned that this experimental model could aid in the identification of specific immune cell populations and transcriptional correlates that support natural defense.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In this study, longitudinal whole blood samples were collected from BDBV-infected rhesus macaques. Clinical pathology, viral loads, and plasma levels of cytokines, chemokines, and thrombosis markers were assessed in surviving and nonsurviving animals (referred to as survivor and fatal subjects, respectively). Transcriptional changes in each data set were compared at early, middle, and late time points after infection to define the immune response at each stage of disease. Humoral responses were measured with BDBV glycoprotein (GP)-specific IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs). These analyses characterize the systemic host response to BDBV exposure. Here, we demonstrate that early cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to survival, whereas prolonged innate immune signaling, coagulation anomalies, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell-associated signaling are associated with severe or fatal disease.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Experimental infection of rhesus macaques.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Ten adult rhesus macaques were intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with a 1,000-PFU target dose of BDBV. The survival rate of macaques up to the 28-day-postinfection (dpi) study endpoint was â¼60% (6 of 10 animals) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). Of the four fatal cases, one animal succumbed at 13 dpi, two animals succumbed at 17 dpi, and one animal succumbed at 19 dpi. Two survivors (survivor 1 and survivor 2) had clinical scores of â¥4 at 9 to 11 dpi, but their condition rapidly improved by 12 dpi (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). All BDBV-infected macaques developed various degrees of illness, including fever, anorexia, macular rash, and/or depression (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Disease manifestations in the fatal cohort were generally more severe. All infected macaques developed fevers except fatal 4 and survivor 5, and all animals except survivor 4 experienced anorexia. Three of four fatal subjects developed a mild petechial rash, one exhibited facial edema, three had diarrhea, and one animal showed signs of neurological disease (fatal 4). In the survivor cohort, three of five survivors suffered mild petechial rashes and one subject presented with emesis and mild dehydration (survivor 2). Hematological or serum biochemistry changes were evident in all BDBV-infected macaques. Fatality correlated with the onset of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and granulocytosis, although these cell population changes were also transiently observed in some survivors. All animals except survivor 5 had elevated levels of liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or creatinine (CRE) concentrations were prominent in the serum of fatal cases and two survivors, pointing to potential kidney damage. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also increased in all fatal cases and four survivors, indicating systemic inflammation.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">We assessed the levels of viremia in each cohort by performing reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) amplification of viral genomic RNA and conventional plaque assays on whole blood samples. All infected animals were PCR positive (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a> and <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Average peak PCR titers were 9.700 Â± 0.998 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (mean Â± standard error of the mean [SEM]) for fatal cases, whereas the mean titers for survivors were 8.596 Â± 0.610 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml. Interestingly, the peak viral RNA titers were not significantly different between surviving and nonsurviving subjects (Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-tailed <i>t</i> test, <i>P</i>â=â0.2301). However, the average peak infectious viral loads were significantly different between the two groups (Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-tailed <i>t</i> test, <i>P</i>â=â0.0017), with titers of 5.815 Â± 1.090 and 3.962 Â± 1.914 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/ml for nonsurviving and surviving subjects, respectively (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a> and <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Infectious virus was never detected in survivor 5 at the time points tested, but this animal had detectable viral RNA on days 7 (5.24 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) and 11 (7.57 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). The high PCR titers and absence of detectable infectious virus in this animal may indicate rapid clearance of viable virus with noninfectious virus components persisting in the blood (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Viremia was reduced or absent in 3 of 4 fatal subjects at end-stage disease, suggesting immune-mediated rather than virus-induced pathology. Finally, no ostensible trend between nonsurviving and surviving (mild or severe) subjects was apparent for viral RNA (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1E</a>) or infectious virus (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1F</a>) loads over the course of the study.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Macaques within the fatal cohort displayed at least one or more histologic lesions consistent with ebolavirus disease (EVD), including histiocytosis and lymphocytolysis within multiple lymph nodes (axillary and inguinal), multifocal necrotizing hepatitis, lymphohistocytic interstitial nephritis, and hemorrhagic necrotizing adrenalitis (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). Other features included lymphohistocytic interstitial pneumonia and lymphocytic perivascular cuffs with multifocal glial nodules within the brain. Diffuse cytoplasmic immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling for anti-BDBV GP antigen was noted in association with the aforementioned lesions (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). IHC-positive cells included mononuclear cells scattered within the following regions: sinuses of the lymph nodes (axillary and inguinal), sinusoids of the liver (Kupffer cells), renal interstitium, adrenal medulla, alveolar septate, and alveoli of the lung (alveolar macrophages). Infrequently, antigen-positive cells included individual hepatocytes, glomerular tufts in the kidney, clusters of cells within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, endothelium, and cells within the glial nodules of the brain. The spleens of all macaques within the fatal cohort had diminished marginal zones with relative sparing of both the mantle zone and periarteriolar sheath (PALS). In the more severe lesions, distinct zones were indiscernible, admixed with hemorrhage and numerous tingible body macrophages. The condition of the red pulp among the fatal cohort ranged from congestion to marked fibrin deposition that infiltrated the disordered marginal zones.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Interestingly, the brainstem of one survivor (survivor 1) had a focal glial nodule and multifocal clustered lymphocytic perivascular cuffs. Associated positive IHC labeling of mononuclear cells within the nodule and ependymal cells of the choroid plexus was found. No other lesions or positive IHC labeling for BDBV antigen were observed in this survivor. The remaining five survivors (survivor 2, survivor 3, survivor 4, survivor 5, and survivor 6) lacked significant lesions or IHC labeling for BDBV antigen in the tissue sections examined.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Targeted transcriptome profiling of BDBV-infected macaques.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To identify transcriptional correlates of protection, we compared immunonomes in fatal and survivor whole blood RNA as previously described (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>).

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Examination of normalized samples by principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed that samples from fatal subjects and survivors with severe illness (subjects with a peak clinical score of â¥4) clustered together, denoting similar transcriptional profiles (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>). Hence, survivors with severe disease were grouped separately from survivors with mild-to-moderate disease for our subsequent analyses. Dimensional separation was observed for the disease stage covariate as evidenced by distinct clustering of early-, middle-, and late-stage samples.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">At the early stage of disease, we identified 98 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05 in samples from survivors with mild-to-moderate versus fatal disease (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material). The most significant DE mRNAs filtered by each disease stage are illustrated in <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>. Most notably, survivors with mild disease had an â¼30-log<sub>2</sub>-fold reduction in the expression of <i>S100A8</i> and <i>S100A9</i> early after infection, whereas survivors with severe disease exhibited an â¼2-log<sub>2</sub>-fold reduction. These mRNAs encode calcium-binding proteins that form a heterodimer (calprotectin) (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>) and are considered hallmark markers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Repression of other MDSC-related transcripts (e.g., <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>CEBPB</i>, <i>CXCR1</i>, and <i>LILRA3</i>) along with the M2 macrophage activation marker, CD163, was also noted. Nevertheless, some of these molecules were transiently expressed in the severe disease survivor group, suggesting that disease severity may be linked to recruitment of these potent immunosuppressors. To test this hypothesis, we compared disease scores and MDSC-related transcripts. Positive correlations were found between <i>S100A8</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â=â0.0004) and <i>S100A9</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â=â0.0002) counts and clinical scores at middle and late disease stages (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Shared upregulated transcripts in survivors were associated with lipid antigen presentation (<i>CD1C</i>) (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), lymphocyte homing (<i>GPR183</i>) (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (<i>CD79B</i> and <i>CD79A</i>) (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (MHC-I) inhibition (<i>LILRB1</i>) (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>), and regulation of B-cell differentiation, proliferation, and maturation to an effector state (<i>IKZF3</i>) (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>) (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>). Inverse correlations were found between clinical scores and BCR-affiliated <i>CD79A</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â&lt;â0.05) and <i>CD79B</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â&lt;â0.05) transcript abundance (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">To rule out whether our sampling scheme (selected early-, middle-, and late-stage disease samples) was responsible for survivor versus fatal transcriptional changes, we also analyzed all collected blood samples independent of dpi (i.e., every collected blood sample rather than selected samples at each disease stage) (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). The survivor data set still showed evidence of activation of adaptive immunity (<i>CD79A</i>, <i>CD79B</i>, <i>TBX21</i>, and HLA-related transcripts), along with reduced MDSC signaling (<i>S100A8</i>, <i>S100A9</i>, and <i>LILRA3</i>), proving that our normalization method was satisfactory (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Using the upstream analysis function of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we next identified DE transcriptional regulators in survivor versus fatal data sets. Survivors showed higher activation of molecules associated with autophagy regulation (<i>IRGM</i>) (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>), interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonism (<i>IL1RN</i>) (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), and antiviral immunity (<i>TRIM24</i>) (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>). At the early disease stage, inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), <i>TNF</i>, and <i>IL1B</i> was projected in both survivor groups, all of which are associated with MDSC activity (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In middle- to late-stage disease, these molecules were expressed at higher levels in the severe survivor cohort than in the fatal group but remained repressed in the mild survivor group.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine canonical pathways associated with protection, we performed Metascape-based functional enrichment of upregulated transcripts (FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05) for fatal and combined mild and severe survivor cohorts (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Metascape/Cytoscape enables visualization of network data with the density of gene cluster interactions and nodes representing signaling intensity. Survivor signatures predominantly enriched to adaptive immunity networks, including lymphocyte activation, BCR regulation, and alpha-beta T cell activation (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). In the fatal cohort, transcripts primarily enriched to gene clusters involved in innate immunity, such as myeloid cell activation, leukocyte migration, Toll-like receptor (TLR) cascades, and IL-1 signaling. In contrast, adaptive immunity-related nodes were minimally apparent. To validate these findings, we also performed functional enrichment using IPA, which takes both positive and negative regulators into account for predicting activation or inhibition of each gene-signaling network. In line with our DE and Metascape results, positive z-scores in survivors correlated with adaptive immunity signatures, including ICOS signaling in T helper cells, NFAT immune regulation, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, protein kinase C-theta (PKCÎ¸) signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper (Th) cells (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4F</a>). Pathways with negative z-scores included those related to hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia, pattern recognition receptor sensing, NK cell signaling, and autoimmunity (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] in T/B cell signaling pathways). Together, these results suggest that BDBV lethality is associated with prolonged innate signaling and minimal or dysregulated adaptive responses.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Next, to capture shifts in circulating cell populations, we used nSolver-based immune cell type profiling (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In agreement with our DE analysis and enrichment results, this feature predicted that DE mRNAs in survivors with mild disease were associated with increased quantities of T helper cell, cytotoxic T cell, and B cell types. Frequencies of B cells early after infection were estimated to wane in survivors exhibiting severe disease. Neutrophil and macrophage populations were predicted to expand in fatal cases, supporting our hematology and histopathology results.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig5"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For a more granular assessment, we also performed digital cell quantification (DCQ) using CIBERSORT to estimate cell type abundances of various B and T cell subsets (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>) (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). At the early disease stage, memory B cells and follicular helper T cells were increased in the mild survivor group, whereas CD8 T cells and memory T cells were increased in the severe survivor group. At middle and late disease stages, both survivor groups had higher quantities of plasma cell and CD8 T cell types than the fatal cohort. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular responses are critical for survival against BDBV.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Assessment of humoral responses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As our DCQ predictions suggested that survival correlated with recruitment of plasma cells, we performed antiglycoprotein (anti-GP) IgG (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a>) and IgM (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on serum samples collected from each subject. Survivors formed BDBV GP-specific IgM and IgG, with both immunoglobulin classes appearing at the middle stage of disease. At the late stage of disease, the antibody titers of survivors with severe disease ranged from 1:800 to 1:25,600 for IgG and 1:800 to 1:3,200 for IgM, whereas the titers in survivors with mild disease ranged from 1:3,200 to 1:12,800 for IgG and 1:800 to 1:12,800 for IgM. Conversely, only low IgM and IgG (1:100 to 1:1,600) titers were noted in fatal subjects. For the surviving subject (survivor 5) with only viral RNA detectable and not infectious virus loads, we observed moderate to high IgM and IgG titers (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). Unlike the immunoglobulin levels in the fatal group, the IgM titers in the survivor cohorts generally declined during the late disease stage, conjointly with increasing moderate to high titers of IgG (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">B</a>). Plaque reduction neutralization tests indicated that survivors had higher, albeit overall low levels of neutralizing antibodies at middle- and late-stage disease (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6C</a>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Measurement of thrombosis-associated markers.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As EVD is known to induce disseminated intravascular coagulation, the concentrations of various thrombosis-associated markers were measured using a cytokine bead array at each disease stage (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Elevated levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6D</a>) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6E</a>) were found in fatal macaques and survivors with severe disease at middle and late disease stages, although declines in these markers were seen in the severe survivor cohort at the latter time point. Interestingly, tPA and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) levels were significantly different in the mild survivor group only at the early disease stage (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6D</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">F</a>). These results indicate a prompt return to coagulation homeostasis in these subjects.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Plasma cytokine bead array analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Finally, soluble mediators (circulating cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) were measured in BDBV-infected macaque plasma samples. IL-1Î² levels were higher in mild disease survivors early after infection, suggesting that innate immunity was briefly stimulated and then arrested in this cohort (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a>). Severe disease and lethality were instead associated with copious increases in markers of innate immune function and inflammation that persisted late into disease, e.g., monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), IP-10, IL-15, IL-18, IL-12/23, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7B</a> to <a href=""#fig7"">E</a>) (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). The expression of these proinflammatory mediators coincided with the onset of clinical disease, similar to previous EBOV reports. Higher systemic increases in IL-2 and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]) mediators were also observed in fatal subjects. The Th2 cytokine IL-4 was more abundantly expressed in survivors in early- to middle-stage disease, which coincides with our enrichment findings indicating activation of both Th2 and Th1 pathways. Additionally, IL-1RA was expressed at higher levels in survivors at the early disease stage. These results indicate that rapid resolution of inflammation was accomplished in survivors with mild disease.</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The continued reemergence of ebolaviruses emphasizes the need for the development of effective countermeasures against these viruses (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Historically, efforts to develop interventions have been hampered, in part, by the dearth of clinical and laboratory research exploring the pathophysiology of EVD. Moreover, clinical samples typically provide only glimpses into the host response, as repeated sampling is uncommon. Prognostic indicators comprising factors that promote or hinder defense against ebolaviruses, particularly BDBV, thus remain incompletely defined. The reduced lethality of BDBV in NHP models (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">â</a><a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), resulting in a pool of survivors, afforded us the unique opportunity of identifying immune correlates that confer protection against ebolaviruses. NHPs are considered the gold standard animal model, as they most accurately recapitulate human EVD (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We compared viral loads, clinical signs, and host responses in BDBV-infected rhesus macaques. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between peak viral RNA titers in fatal and survivor macaques, but there was a significant difference in infectious titers. This finding may reflect comparable initial dissemination of the virus in each cohort but the inability to remove infected cells and terminate the immune response in fatal cases. Immunological control, whether mediated by innate or adaptive responses, is thus likely responsible for infectious virus clearance in survivors. All animals displayed various degrees of illness along with hematological changes. Disease severity and fatal outcome corresponded with liver dysfunction, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a hallmark feature of EVD and is characterized by hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Consequences of DIC include hemorrhagic diathesis due to consumption of platelets and clotting factors, as well as widespread deposition of fibrin clots (thrombi) that become trapped in small blood vessels, resulting in ischemia, hemolytic anemia (erythrocytes are fragmented during transport through narrowed microvasculature), and occasionally organ failure. One key event that triggers this EVD phenomenon is oversecretion of tissue factor by monocytes and macrophages (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Another mechanism involves increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-I) in response to marked increases in cytokines and/or circulating LPS (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). The thrombosis-associated markers PAI-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were elevated in fatal macaques and survivors exhibiting severe illness after BDBV exposure, suggesting that these factors may also play a role in DIC. Higher PAI-1 levels were also found in pediatric patients infected with <i>Sudan ebolavirus</i> (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>) and fatal human cases of Lassa virus disease (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), suggesting that this marker may represent a universal feature among hemorrhagic fever virus infections. PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that normally functions as an inhibitor of plasminogen activators like tPA and urokinase (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). In that sense, PAI-1 halts, whereas tPA promotes, fibrinolysis. While both PAI-1 and tPA were elevated among fatal macaques and survivors with severe disease, exceptionally high levels of tPA may enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis, alluding to the complexity of fibrinolysis homeostasis. Coagulation changes that mimic DIC may also play a role in the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent paper revealed that elevation of tPA and PAI-1 was significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). A strong correlation was found between tPA/PAI-1 concentrations and both absolute neutrophil counts and systemic calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer) levels.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our results indicated that severe and fatal disease also corresponded with granulocytosis and monocytosis. Neutrophil granulocytes are spared from EBOV infection, but their degranulation, proinflammatory secretion, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, EBOV readily infects monocytes and macrophages, leading to their activation and resulting in massive cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor secretion (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a><a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42 B43"">â</a><a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). Our studies and others have shown that monocytes are the major cell targets for EBOV <i>in vivo</i> and constitute a significant proportion of transcriptional changes in blood cells from infected macaques (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). These studies support the notion that monocytes and/or neutrophils are strongly implicated in EVD pathophysiology.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our analyses indicated that a fatal outcome was associated with MDSC-related transcriptional signatures (e.g., <i>S100A8</i>, <i>S100A9</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>CEBPB</i>, <i>LILRA3</i>, and <i>CXCR1</i>) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). MDSCs are pathologically activated monocytes and neutrophils with potent immunosuppressive activity (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The morphological and physiological resemblance of MDSCs to conventional monocytes and granulocytes makes it difficult to distinguish between these cell types. To further complicate matters, based on their theorized granulocytic or monocytic lineage, two MDSC subsets exist, granulocytic/polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) and monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC), each with distinct cellular profiles and mechanisms of immunosuppression. Whereas classical activation of myeloid cells is driven primarily by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and quickly subsides after clearance of the stimulus, pathological activation arises from a persistent environment of growth factors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF]), chemokines (CCL2 [MCP-1]), and inflammatory signals (IL-1 beta, IL-18, VEGF, IL-6, HIF1-alpha, and adenosine) in the absence of pathogen clearance (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). In the present study, the expression of many of these polarizing factors was associated with disease severity or fatal outcome following BDBV exposure. Great effort has been put forth in recent years to define the genomic, proteomic, and metabolic signatures of MDSCs, given their implication in numerous pathological conditions, including sepsis, cancer, chronic infections, and various autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Our results showed increased transcripts mapping to SLE in T/B cell signaling pathways in the fatal data set, implying that EVD and SLE may share certain pathological features.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Other supporting evidence for the role of MDSC in filovirus pathogenesis is reports of an accumulation of low-density neutrophils in humans or NHPs infected with EBOV (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). PMN-MDSCs have a lower density than conventional neutrophils, enabling them to fractionate with the peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) interface in density gradient blood preparations. Moreover, our group and others have identified rapidly expanding monocyte-like populations that express low levels of MHC-II molecules, a defining feature of M-MDSCs (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). One caveat of our study is that we did not perform flow cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to determine whether MDSCs were indeed recruited and contributed to the bulk DE transcripts identified. However, our previous transcriptional analysis of purified monocytes from infected macaques supports monocytes as major contributors of gene expression changes in peripheral cells that express high levels of MDSC-related transcripts, including many that we have identified in this study (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). More recently, comprehensive scRNA-Seq, along with high-dimensional flow cytometry, confirmed that monocyte-like cells from EBOV-infected rhesus macaques express high levels of <i>S100A8</i>/<i>S100A9</i> and downregulate multiple MHC-II-related molecules (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). The authors of this study suggested these cells might represent immature monocytes or bone marrow monocyte precursors released during emergency myelopoiesis. Importantly, future studies should test whether these cells represent <i>bona fide</i> MDSCs by assessing their ability to suppress the adaptive immune response via <i>ex vivo</i> functional assays. M-MDSCs can suppress T cell activity by secreting nitric oxide (NO) and immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-Î²]) or expressing immune regulatory molecules (PDL-1). PMN-MDSCs preferentially exploit ROS, prostaglandins, peroxynitrite, and arginase 1 to mediate immune suppression (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Macrophages that are differentiated from M-MDSCs but not monocytes are immunosuppressive and share similar genomic profiles. Kwak et al. demonstrated that the immunosuppressive activity of M-MDSC-derived macrophages is dependent on prolonged expression of S100A9 protein in these cells and involves the transcription factor C/EBPÎ² (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). The authors also demonstrated that S100A9 promotes M2 polarization of macrophages. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which participate in pathogen killing, M2 alternatively activated macrophages are generally anti-inflammatory. Therefore, these cells could promote an environment that enhances viral replication or downregulates the adaptive immune response. McElroy et al. showed substantial immunoreactivity of the M2-affiliated marker CD163 in association with viral antigen in the tissues of human fatal cases (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). This marker was associated with both disease severity and fatal outcome. Our results also indicated higher expression of <i>CD163</i> in fatal subjects, as well as abundant tingible body macrophages in lymphoid tissue, further supporting that M2-like macrophages contribute to ebolavirus pathogenesis. Tingible body macrophages are thought to downregulate the germinal center reaction by releasing prostaglandins and inhibiting IL-2 production, which may contribute to the lack of adaptive responses (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). Disruption of the B cell-rich marginal zone within the germinal center architecture in lymphoid tissue may exacerbate this condition, as this finding was prominent in fatal cases in our study.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Conversely, germinal centers were intact in surviving animals with the absence of an accumulation of tingible body macrophages; analysis of DE transcripts demonstrated that survivors also expressed more transcripts enriching to B cell antigen receptor signaling (<i>CD79B</i> and <i>CD79A</i>) (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Previous studies have shown that downregulation of <i>CD79A</i> is observed in B cells during acute disease following exposure of rhesus macaques to EBOV (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), which may serve as a virus mechanism to impede B cell activation and generation of memory B cells. Indeed, lower predicted frequencies of IgM and IgG memory B cells, neutralizing titers, and transcriptionally derived plasma cell quantities were detected in fatal macaques. In contrast, estimated increases in these B cell subsets were observed in survivors, along with higher ELISA titers of BDBV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing titers. Transcripts mapping to numerous cellular immunity- and humoral immunity-related pathways, including ICOS signaling in T helper cells (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>), PKCÎ¸ signaling (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), and CD28 signaling in T helper (Th) cells (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), were also higher in survivor than in fatal data sets. Although lymphocyte activation signaling was found in fatal cases, these transcriptional responses appeared nonspecific rather than a result of antigen-dependent T and B cell activation and were possibly cytokine mediated (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). Therefore, both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity are likely pivotal for protection against EVD.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, we identified potential biomarkers that predict EVD disease severity and lethality. Sustained activation of innate immunity, MDSC-related signaling, and dysregulation of fibrinolytic pathways were prominent findings in fatal cases. Survivors expressed T cell- and B cell-related transcripts and other mRNAs mapping to adaptive immune pathways, signifying that both cellular and humoral immunity are critical for protection against EVD. Elucidation of the mechanisms that confer lethality or defense against ebolaviruses can be harnessed to develop diagnostics or immunomodulatory therapies for these deadly pathogens.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are ebolaviruses endemic to Africa that cause severe, often fatal hemorrhagic disease. BDBV is considered a less pathogenic ebolavirus due to its reduced lethality during human outbreaks, as well as in experimentally infected nonhuman primates. The reduced mortality of BDBV in NHP models, resulting in a pool of survivors, afforded us the unique opportunity of identifying immune correlates that confer protection against ebolaviruses. In this study, we discovered that the survival of BDBV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) was dependent on early development of adaptive (memory) immune responses and reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-related signaling. MDSCs are a heterogenous group of immune cells implicated in a number of diseases that are powerful immunosuppressors of cellular and humoral immunity. Thus, MDSCs represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent ebolavirus disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study to link increased morbidity with recruitment of these potent immunosuppressive cells.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>Ebolavirus</i> genus comprises six species: <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i>, <i>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</i>, <i>Sudan ebolavirus</i>, <i>Tai Forest ebolavirus</i>, <i>Reston ebolavirus</i>, and the recently discovered <i>Bombali ebolaviru</i>s (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The ongoing outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV; species <i>Zaire ebolavirus</i>) in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea demonstrate that ebolaviruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Clinical manifestations of ebolavirus-infected humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) are similar, including high viremia, hypercytokinemia, and consumptive coagulopathy, which may progress to septic shock and multiorgan failure (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). The virus initially replicates in monocytes and dendritic cells and then spreads to hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Bundibugyo virus (BDBV; species <i>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</i>) is considered a less pathogenic ebolavirus due to its reduced lethality during human outbreaks (25 to 51%), as well as in experimentally infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">â</a><a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). In contrast, infection of NHPs with EBOV results in nearly uniform lethality (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). While in-depth transcriptome analyses have been performed on samples from EBOV-infected human patients and NHPs, no such studies exist for BDBV (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15"">â</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). As macaques are incompletely protected against BDBV disease, we reasoned that this experimental model could aid in the identification of specific immune cell populations and transcriptional correlates that support natural defense.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In this study, longitudinal whole blood samples were collected from BDBV-infected rhesus macaques. Clinical pathology, viral loads, and plasma levels of cytokines, chemokines, and thrombosis markers were assessed in surviving and nonsurviving animals (referred to as survivor and fatal subjects, respectively). Transcriptional changes in each data set were compared at early, middle, and late time points after infection to define the immune response at each stage of disease. Humoral responses were measured with BDBV glycoprotein (GP)-specific IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs). These analyses characterize the systemic host response to BDBV exposure. Here, we demonstrate that early cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to survival, whereas prolonged innate immune signaling, coagulation anomalies, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell-associated signaling are associated with severe or fatal disease.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Experimental infection of rhesus macaques.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Ten adult rhesus macaques were intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with a 1,000-PFU target dose of BDBV. The survival rate of macaques up to the 28-day-postinfection (dpi) study endpoint was â¼60% (6 of 10 animals) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). Of the four fatal cases, one animal succumbed at 13 dpi, two animals succumbed at 17 dpi, and one animal succumbed at 19 dpi. Two survivors (survivor 1 and survivor 2) had clinical scores of â¥4 at 9 to 11 dpi, but their condition rapidly improved by 12 dpi (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). All BDBV-infected macaques developed various degrees of illness, including fever, anorexia, macular rash, and/or depression (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Disease manifestations in the fatal cohort were generally more severe. All infected macaques developed fevers except fatal 4 and survivor 5, and all animals except survivor 4 experienced anorexia. Three of four fatal subjects developed a mild petechial rash, one exhibited facial edema, three had diarrhea, and one animal showed signs of neurological disease (fatal 4). In the survivor cohort, three of five survivors suffered mild petechial rashes and one subject presented with emesis and mild dehydration (survivor 2). Hematological or serum biochemistry changes were evident in all BDBV-infected macaques. Fatality correlated with the onset of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and granulocytosis, although these cell population changes were also transiently observed in some survivors. All animals except survivor 5 had elevated levels of liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or creatinine (CRE) concentrations were prominent in the serum of fatal cases and two survivors, pointing to potential kidney damage. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also increased in all fatal cases and four survivors, indicating systemic inflammation.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">We assessed the levels of viremia in each cohort by performing reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) amplification of viral genomic RNA and conventional plaque assays on whole blood samples. All infected animals were PCR positive (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a> and <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Average peak PCR titers were 9.700 Â± 0.998 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (mean Â± standard error of the mean [SEM]) for fatal cases, whereas the mean titers for survivors were 8.596 Â± 0.610 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml. Interestingly, the peak viral RNA titers were not significantly different between surviving and nonsurviving subjects (Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-tailed <i>t</i> test, <i>P</i>â=â0.2301). However, the average peak infectious viral loads were significantly different between the two groups (Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-tailed <i>t</i> test, <i>P</i>â=â0.0017), with titers of 5.815 Â± 1.090 and 3.962 Â± 1.914 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/ml for nonsurviving and surviving subjects, respectively (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a> and <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). Infectious virus was never detected in survivor 5 at the time points tested, but this animal had detectable viral RNA on days 7 (5.24 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) and 11 (7.57 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). The high PCR titers and absence of detectable infectious virus in this animal may indicate rapid clearance of viable virus with noninfectious virus components persisting in the blood (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Viremia was reduced or absent in 3 of 4 fatal subjects at end-stage disease, suggesting immune-mediated rather than virus-induced pathology. Finally, no ostensible trend between nonsurviving and surviving (mild or severe) subjects was apparent for viral RNA (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1E</a>) or infectious virus (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1F</a>) loads over the course of the study.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Macaques within the fatal cohort displayed at least one or more histologic lesions consistent with ebolavirus disease (EVD), including histiocytosis and lymphocytolysis within multiple lymph nodes (axillary and inguinal), multifocal necrotizing hepatitis, lymphohistocytic interstitial nephritis, and hemorrhagic necrotizing adrenalitis (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). Other features included lymphohistocytic interstitial pneumonia and lymphocytic perivascular cuffs with multifocal glial nodules within the brain. Diffuse cytoplasmic immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling for anti-BDBV GP antigen was noted in association with the aforementioned lesions (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). IHC-positive cells included mononuclear cells scattered within the following regions: sinuses of the lymph nodes (axillary and inguinal), sinusoids of the liver (Kupffer cells), renal interstitium, adrenal medulla, alveolar septate, and alveoli of the lung (alveolar macrophages). Infrequently, antigen-positive cells included individual hepatocytes, glomerular tufts in the kidney, clusters of cells within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, endothelium, and cells within the glial nodules of the brain. The spleens of all macaques within the fatal cohort had diminished marginal zones with relative sparing of both the mantle zone and periarteriolar sheath (PALS). In the more severe lesions, distinct zones were indiscernible, admixed with hemorrhage and numerous tingible body macrophages. The condition of the red pulp among the fatal cohort ranged from congestion to marked fibrin deposition that infiltrated the disordered marginal zones.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Examination of normalized samples by principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed that samples from fatal subjects and survivors with severe illness (subjects with a peak clinical score of â¥4) clustered together, denoting similar transcriptional profiles (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>). Hence, survivors with severe disease were grouped separately from survivors with mild-to-moderate disease for our subsequent analyses. Dimensional separation was observed for the disease stage covariate as evidenced by distinct clustering of early-, middle-, and late-stage samples.</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">At the early stage of disease, we identified 98 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05 in samples from survivors with mild-to-moderate versus fatal disease (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material). The most significant DE mRNAs filtered by each disease stage are illustrated in <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>. Most notably, survivors with mild disease had an â¼30-log<sub>2</sub>-fold reduction in the expression of <i>S100A8</i> and <i>S100A9</i> early after infection, whereas survivors with severe disease exhibited an â¼2-log<sub>2</sub>-fold reduction. These mRNAs encode calcium-binding proteins that form a heterodimer (calprotectin) (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>) and are considered hallmark markers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Repression of other MDSC-related transcripts (e.g., <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>CEBPB</i>, <i>CXCR1</i>, and <i>LILRA3</i>) along with the M2 macrophage activation marker, CD163, was also noted. Nevertheless, some of these molecules were transiently expressed in the severe disease survivor group, suggesting that disease severity may be linked to recruitment of these potent immunosuppressors. To test this hypothesis, we compared disease scores and MDSC-related transcripts. Positive correlations were found between <i>S100A8</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â=â0.0004) and <i>S100A9</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â=â0.0002) counts and clinical scores at middle and late disease stages (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Shared upregulated transcripts in survivors were associated with lipid antigen presentation (<i>CD1C</i>) (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), lymphocyte homing (<i>GPR183</i>) (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (<i>CD79B</i> and <i>CD79A</i>) (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (MHC-I) inhibition (<i>LILRB1</i>) (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>), and regulation of B-cell differentiation, proliferation, and maturation to an effector state (<i>IKZF3</i>) (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>) (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>). Inverse correlations were found between clinical scores and BCR-affiliated <i>CD79A</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â&lt;â0.05) and <i>CD79B</i> (Pearson, <i>P</i>â&lt;â0.05) transcript abundance (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">To rule out whether our sampling scheme (selected early-, middle-, and late-stage disease samples) was responsible for survivor versus fatal transcriptional changes, we also analyzed all collected blood samples independent of dpi (i.e., every collected blood sample rather than selected samples at each disease stage) (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). The survivor data set still showed evidence of activation of adaptive immunity (<i>CD79A</i>, <i>CD79B</i>, <i>TBX21</i>, and HLA-related transcripts), along with reduced MDSC signaling (<i>S100A8</i>, <i>S100A9</i>, and <i>LILRA3</i>), proving that our normalization method was satisfactory (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Using the upstream analysis function of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we next identified DE transcriptional regulators in survivor versus fatal data sets. Survivors showed higher activation of molecules associated with autophagy regulation (<i>IRGM</i>) (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>), interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonism (<i>IL1RN</i>) (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), and antiviral immunity (<i>TRIM24</i>) (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>). At the early disease stage, inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), <i>TNF</i>, and <i>IL1B</i> was projected in both survivor groups, all of which are associated with MDSC activity (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In middle- to late-stage disease, these molecules were expressed at higher levels in the severe survivor cohort than in the fatal group but remained repressed in the mild survivor group.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine canonical pathways associated with protection, we performed Metascape-based functional enrichment of upregulated transcripts (FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05) for fatal and combined mild and severe survivor cohorts (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Metascape/Cytoscape enables visualization of network data with the density of gene cluster interactions and nodes representing signaling intensity. Survivor signatures predominantly enriched to adaptive immunity networks, including lymphocyte activation, BCR regulation, and alpha-beta T cell activation (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). In the fatal cohort, transcripts primarily enriched to gene clusters involved in innate immunity, such as myeloid cell activation, leukocyte migration, Toll-like receptor (TLR) cascades, and IL-1 signaling. In contrast, adaptive immunity-related nodes were minimally apparent. To validate these findings, we also performed functional enrichment using IPA, which takes both positive and negative regulators into account for predicting activation or inhibition of each gene-signaling network. In line with our DE and Metascape results, positive z-scores in survivors correlated with adaptive immunity signatures, including ICOS signaling in T helper cells, NFAT immune regulation, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, protein kinase C-theta (PKCÎ¸) signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper (Th) cells (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4F</a>). Pathways with negative z-scores included those related to hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia, pattern recognition receptor sensing, NK cell signaling, and autoimmunity (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] in T/B cell signaling pathways). Together, these results suggest that BDBV lethality is associated with prolonged innate signaling and minimal or dysregulated adaptive responses.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Next, to capture shifts in circulating cell populations, we used nSolver-based immune cell type profiling (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In agreement with our DE analysis and enrichment results, this feature predicted that DE mRNAs in survivors with mild disease were associated with increased quantities of T helper cell, cytotoxic T cell, and B cell types. Frequencies of B cells early after infection were estimated to wane in survivors exhibiting severe disease. Neutrophil and macrophage populations were predicted to expand in fatal cases, supporting our hematology and histopathology results.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig5"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For a more granular assessment, we also performed digital cell quantification (DCQ) using CIBERSORT to estimate cell type abundances of various B and T cell subsets (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>) (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). At the early disease stage, memory B cells and follicular helper T cells were increased in the mild survivor group, whereas CD8 T cells and memory T cells were increased in the severe survivor group. At middle and late disease stages, both survivor groups had higher quantities of plasma cell and CD8 T cell types than the fatal cohort. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular responses are critical for survival against BDBV.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Assessment of humoral responses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As our DCQ predictions suggested that survival correlated with recruitment of plasma cells, we performed antiglycoprotein (anti-GP) IgG (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a>) and IgM (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on serum samples collected from each subject. Survivors formed BDBV GP-specific IgM and IgG, with both immunoglobulin classes appearing at the middle stage of disease. At the late stage of disease, the antibody titers of survivors with severe disease ranged from 1:800 to 1:25,600 for IgG and 1:800 to 1:3,200 for IgM, whereas the titers in survivors with mild disease ranged from 1:3,200 to 1:12,800 for IgG and 1:800 to 1:12,800 for IgM. Conversely, only low IgM and IgG (1:100 to 1:1,600) titers were noted in fatal subjects. For the surviving subject (survivor 5) with only viral RNA detectable and not infectious virus loads, we observed moderate to high IgM and IgG titers (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). Unlike the immunoglobulin levels in the fatal group, the IgM titers in the survivor cohorts generally declined during the late disease stage, conjointly with increasing moderate to high titers of IgG (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">B</a>). Plaque reduction neutralization tests indicated that survivors had higher, albeit overall low levels of neutralizing antibodies at middle- and late-stage disease (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6C</a>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Measurement of thrombosis-associated markers.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As EVD is known to induce disseminated intravascular coagulation, the concentrations of various thrombosis-associated markers were measured using a cytokine bead array at each disease stage (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Elevated levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6D</a>) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6E</a>) were found in fatal macaques and survivors with severe disease at middle and late disease stages, although declines in these markers were seen in the severe survivor cohort at the latter time point. Interestingly, tPA and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) levels were significantly different in the mild survivor group only at the early disease stage (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6D</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">F</a>). These results indicate a prompt return to coagulation homeostasis in these subjects.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Plasma cytokine bead array analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Finally, soluble mediators (circulating cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) were measured in BDBV-infected macaque plasma samples. IL-1Î² levels were higher in mild disease survivors early after infection, suggesting that innate immunity was briefly stimulated and then arrested in this cohort (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a>). Severe disease and lethality were instead associated with copious increases in markers of innate immune function and inflammation that persisted late into disease, e.g., monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), IP-10, IL-15, IL-18, IL-12/23, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7B</a> to <a href=""#fig7"">E</a>) (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). The expression of these proinflammatory mediators coincided with the onset of clinical disease, similar to previous EBOV reports. Higher systemic increases in IL-2 and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]) mediators were also observed in fatal subjects. The Th2 cytokine IL-4 was more abundantly expressed in survivors in early- to middle-stage disease, which coincides with our enrichment findings indicating activation of both Th2 and Th1 pathways. Additionally, IL-1RA was expressed at higher levels in survivors at the early disease stage. These results indicate that rapid resolution of inflammation was accomplished in survivors with mild disease.</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The continued reemergence of ebolaviruses emphasizes the need for the development of effective countermeasures against these viruses (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Historically, efforts to develop interventions have been hampered, in part, by the dearth of clinical and laboratory research exploring the pathophysiology of EVD. Moreover, clinical samples typically provide only glimpses into the host response, as repeated sampling is uncommon. Prognostic indicators comprising factors that promote or hinder defense against ebolaviruses, particularly BDBV, thus remain incompletely defined. The reduced lethality of BDBV in NHP models (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">â</a><a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), resulting in a pool of survivors, afforded us the unique opportunity of identifying immune correlates that confer protection against ebolaviruses. NHPs are considered the gold standard animal model, as they most accurately recapitulate human EVD (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We compared viral loads, clinical signs, and host responses in BDBV-infected rhesus macaques. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between peak viral RNA titers in fatal and survivor macaques, but there was a significant difference in infectious titers. This finding may reflect comparable initial dissemination of the virus in each cohort but the inability to remove infected cells and terminate the immune response in fatal cases. Immunological control, whether mediated by innate or adaptive responses, is thus likely responsible for infectious virus clearance in survivors. All animals displayed various degrees of illness along with hematological changes. Disease severity and fatal outcome corresponded with liver dysfunction, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a hallmark feature of EVD and is characterized by hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Consequences of DIC include hemorrhagic diathesis due to consumption of platelets and clotting factors, as well as widespread deposition of fibrin clots (thrombi) that become trapped in small blood vessels, resulting in ischemia, hemolytic anemia (erythrocytes are fragmented during transport through narrowed microvasculature), and occasionally organ failure. One key event that triggers this EVD phenomenon is oversecretion of tissue factor by monocytes and macrophages (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Another mechanism involves increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-I) in response to marked increases in cytokines and/or circulating LPS (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). The thrombosis-associated markers PAI-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were elevated in fatal macaques and survivors exhibiting severe illness after BDBV exposure, suggesting that these factors may also play a role in DIC. Higher PAI-1 levels were also found in pediatric patients infected with <i>Sudan ebolavirus</i> (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>) and fatal human cases of Lassa virus disease (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), suggesting that this marker may represent a universal feature among hemorrhagic fever virus infections. PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that normally functions as an inhibitor of plasminogen activators like tPA and urokinase (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). In that sense, PAI-1 halts, whereas tPA promotes, fibrinolysis. While both PAI-1 and tPA were elevated among fatal macaques and survivors with severe disease, exceptionally high levels of tPA may enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis, alluding to the complexity of fibrinolysis homeostasis. Coagulation changes that mimic DIC may also play a role in the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent paper revealed that elevation of tPA and PAI-1 was significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). A strong correlation was found between tPA/PAI-1 concentrations and both absolute neutrophil counts and systemic calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer) levels.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our results indicated that severe and fatal disease also corresponded with granulocytosis and monocytosis. Neutrophil granulocytes are spared from EBOV infection, but their degranulation, proinflammatory secretion, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, EBOV readily infects monocytes and macrophages, leading to their activation and resulting in massive cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor secretion (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a><a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42 B43"">â</a><a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). Our studies and others have shown that monocytes are the major cell targets for EBOV <i>in vivo</i> and constitute a significant proportion of transcriptional changes in blood cells from infected macaques (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). These studies support the notion that monocytes and/or neutrophils are strongly implicated in EVD pathophysiology.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our analyses indicated that a fatal outcome was associated with MDSC-related transcriptional signatures (e.g., <i>S100A8</i>, <i>S100A9</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>CEBPB</i>, <i>LILRA3</i>, and <i>CXCR1</i>) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). MDSCs are pathologically activated monocytes and neutrophils with potent immunosuppressive activity (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The morphological and physiological resemblance of MDSCs to conventional monocytes and granulocytes makes it difficult to distinguish between these cell types. To further complicate matters, based on their theorized granulocytic or monocytic lineage, two MDSC subsets exist, granulocytic/polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) and monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC), each with distinct cellular profiles and mechanisms of immunosuppression. Whereas classical activation of myeloid cells is driven primarily by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and quickly subsides after clearance of the stimulus, pathological activation arises from a persistent environment of growth factors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF]), chemokines (CCL2 [MCP-1]), and inflammatory signals (IL-1 beta, IL-18, VEGF, IL-6, HIF1-alpha, and adenosine) in the absence of pathogen clearance (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). In the present study, the expression of many of these polarizing factors was associated with disease severity or fatal outcome following BDBV exposure. Great effort has been put forth in recent years to define the genomic, proteomic, and metabolic signatures of MDSCs, given their implication in numerous pathological conditions, including sepsis, cancer, chronic infections, and various autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Our results showed increased transcripts mapping to SLE in T/B cell signaling pathways in the fatal data set, implying that EVD and SLE may share certain pathological features.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Other supporting evidence for the role of MDSC in filovirus pathogenesis is reports of an accumulation of low-density neutrophils in humans or NHPs infected with EBOV (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). PMN-MDSCs have a lower density than conventional neutrophils, enabling them to fractionate with the peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) interface in density gradient blood preparations. Moreover, our group and others have identified rapidly expanding monocyte-like populations that express low levels of MHC-II molecules, a defining feature of M-MDSCs (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). One caveat of our study is that we did not perform flow cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to determine whether MDSCs were indeed recruited and contributed to the bulk DE transcripts identified. However, our previous transcriptional analysis of purified monocytes from infected macaques supports monocytes as major contributors of gene expression changes in peripheral cells that express high levels of MDSC-related transcripts, including many that we have identified in this study (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). More recently, comprehensive scRNA-Seq, along with high-dimensional flow cytometry, confirmed that monocyte-like cells from EBOV-infected rhesus macaques express high levels of <i>S100A8</i>/<i>S100A9</i> and downregulate multiple MHC-II-related molecules (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). The authors of this study suggested these cells might represent immature monocytes or bone marrow monocyte precursors released during emergency myelopoiesis. Importantly, future studies should test whether these cells represent <i>bona fide</i> MDSCs by assessing their ability to suppress the adaptive immune response via <i>ex vivo</i> functional assays. M-MDSCs can suppress T cell activity by secreting nitric oxide (NO) and immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-Î²]) or expressing immune regulatory molecules (PDL-1). PMN-MDSCs preferentially exploit ROS, prostaglandins, peroxynitrite, and arginase 1 to mediate immune suppression (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Macrophages that are differentiated from M-MDSCs but not monocytes are immunosuppressive and share similar genomic profiles. Kwak et al. demonstrated that the immunosuppressive activity of M-MDSC-derived macrophages is dependent on prolonged expression of S100A9 protein in these cells and involves the transcription factor C/EBPÎ² (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). The authors also demonstrated that S100A9 promotes M2 polarization of macrophages. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which participate in pathogen killing, M2 alternatively activated macrophages are generally anti-inflammatory. Therefore, these cells could promote an environment that enhances viral replication or downregulates the adaptive immune response. McElroy et al. showed substantial immunoreactivity of the M2-affiliated marker CD163 in association with viral antigen in the tissues of human fatal cases (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). This marker was associated with both disease severity and fatal outcome. Our results also indicated higher expression of <i>CD163</i> in fatal subjects, as well as abundant tingible body macrophages in lymphoid tissue, further supporting that M2-like macrophages contribute to ebolavirus pathogenesis. Tingible body macrophages are thought to downregulate the germinal center reaction by releasing prostaglandins and inhibiting IL-2 production, which may contribute to the lack of adaptive responses (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). Disruption of the B cell-rich marginal zone within the germinal center architecture in lymphoid tissue may exacerbate this condition, as this finding was prominent in fatal cases in our study.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Conversely, germinal centers were intact in surviving animals with the absence of an accumulation of tingible body macrophages; analysis of DE transcripts demonstrated that survivors also expressed more transcripts enriching to B cell antigen receptor signaling (<i>CD79B</i> and <i>CD79A</i>) (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Previous studies have shown that downregulation of <i>CD79A</i> is observed in B cells during acute disease following exposure of rhesus macaques to EBOV (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), which may serve as a virus mechanism to impede B cell activation and generation of memory B cells. Indeed, lower predicted frequencies of IgM and IgG memory B cells, neutralizing titers, and transcriptionally derived plasma cell quantities were detected in fatal macaques. In contrast, estimated increases in these B cell subsets were observed in survivors, along with higher ELISA titers of BDBV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing titers. Transcripts mapping to numerous cellular immunity- and humoral immunity-related pathways, including ICOS signaling in T helper cells (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>), PKCÎ¸ signaling (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), and CD28 signaling in T helper (Th) cells (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), were also higher in survivor than in fatal data sets. Although lymphocyte activation signaling was found in fatal cases, these transcriptional responses appeared nonspecific rather than a result of antigen-dependent T and B cell activation and were possibly cytokine mediated (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). Therefore, both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity are likely pivotal for protection against EVD.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, we identified potential biomarkers that predict EVD disease severity and lethality. Sustained activation of innate immunity, MDSC-related signaling, and dysregulation of fibrinolytic pathways were prominent findings in fatal cases. Survivors expressed T cell- and B cell-related transcripts and other mRNAs mapping to adaptive immune pathways, signifying that both cellular and humoral immunity are critical for protection against EVD. Elucidation of the mechanisms that confer lethality or defense against ebolaviruses can be harnessed to develop diagnostics or immunomodulatory therapies for these deadly pathogens.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

A Piccolo point-of-care analyzer and biochemistry panel plus analyzer discs (Abaxis) were used to test for serum concentrations of albumin, amylase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose, cholesterol, total protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), uric acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Necropsy was performed on all subjects in the BSL4 facility. Tissue samples for histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination were immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 21âdays, followed by a change of formalin, before removal from the BSL4 facility. Inactivated tissue samples were processed in a BSL1 facility. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through xylene and graded ethanol.

To block endogenous peroxidase activity, slides were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and rinsed in distilled water. The tissue sections were processed for IHC using the Thermo Autostainer 360 (ThermoFisher, Kalamazoo, MI). Sequential 15-minute incubations with avidin D and biotin solutions (Vector, Burlingame, CA) were performed to block endogenous biotin reactivity. Specific anti-BDBV immunoreactivity was detected using an anti-BDBV GP primary antibody at a 1:2,000 dilution for 60âmin (IBTS Services, Gaithersburg, MD).

<div role=""paragraph"">nCounter .RCC files were imported into NanoString nSolver 4.0 software. All samples met the established QC criteria. To compensate for differing RNA inputs, housekeeping genes and spiked-in positive and negative controls were used to normalize raw counts. The data were analyzed using the NanoString nSolver Advanced Analysis 2.0 package to generate principal component (PC) figures, cell type trend plots, and mRNA expression heatmaps (a full list of probes detected for each sample group, along with fold change values and <i>P</i> values, can be found in Data Set S1 in the supplemental material).

<div role=""paragraph"">Sera collected at the indicated time points were tested for BDBV GP-specific IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA. MaxiSorp 96-well plates (catalog number 44-204; Thermo Fisher, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight with 15âng/well (0.15âml) of recombinant BDBV GP lacking the transmembrane region (GPÎTM; Integrated Biotherapeutics, Gaithersburg, MD) in a sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution (pH 9.6). Antigen-adsorbed wells were subsequently blocked with 4% bovine serum antigen (BSA) in 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for at least 2 h. Sera were initially diluted 1:100 and then 2-fold through 1:12,800 in ELISA diluent (1% BSA in 1Ã PBS and 0.2% Tween 20).

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00974-20","<div role=""paragraph"">Rhizobia are ecologically important, facultative plant-symbiotic microbes. In nature, there is a large variability in the association of rhizobial strains and host plants of the same species. Here, we evaluated whether plant and rhizobial genotypes influence the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium following perception of a host plant. RNA sequencing of the model rhizobium <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span> exposed to root exudates or luteolin (an inducer of <i>nod</i> genes, involved in the early steps of symbiotic interaction) was performed on a combination of three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains and three alfalfa varieties as host plants. The response to root exudates involved hundreds of changes in the rhizobium transcriptome. Of the differentially expressed genes, 35% were influenced by the strain genotype, 16% were influenced by the plant genotype, and 29% were influenced by strain-by-host plant genotype interactions. We also examined the response of a hybrid <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid (â¼20% of the genome) was mobilized between two of the above-mentioned strains. Dozens of genes were upregulated in the hybrid strain, indicative of nonadditive variation in the transcriptome. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that transcriptional responses of rhizobia upon perception of legumes are influenced by the genotypes of both symbiotic partners and their interaction, suggesting a wide spectrum of genetic determinants involved in the phenotypic variation of plant-rhizobium symbiosis.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbes play a crucial role in the biology and evolution of their eukaryotic hosts (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Among other activities, microbes contribute to the hostâs acquisition of nutrients (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), functioning of the hostâs immune system (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>), and protection of the host from predation (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). The rules governing host-microbe interactions remain a topic of intense investigation. In many cases, the eukaryotic host selectively recruits the desired microbial partner: squid light organs are selectively colonized by <i>Vibrio</i> symbionts (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), legumes select for effective symbionts by sanctioning noneffective symbionts (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>), and the crop microbiome is cultivar dependent (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The genetic basis determining the quality of a microbial symbiont (i.e., its ability to improve host plant phenotypes such as growth and tolerance) and its ability to effectively colonize its eukaryotic partner is generally not well understood, but evolution experiments and high-throughput genome sequencing projects of host-associated microbes and complete microbiomes are shedding light on this topic (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10 B11 B12 B13"">â</a><a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). In the case of plants, such studies have observed an enrichment of certain gene functions in plant-associated microbes, such as genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, secretion systems, phytohormone production, and phosphorus solubilization (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The rhizobia are an ecologically important exemplar of facultative host-associated microbes. These soil-dwelling bacteria are able to colonize plants and enter an endosymbiotic association with plants of the family <i>Fabaceae</i> (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). This developmentally complex process begins with an exchange of signals between the free-living organisms (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>), which leads to the invasion of the plant by the rhizobia (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), and culminates in the formation of a new organ (a nodule) in which the plant cells are intracellularly colonized by N<sub>2</sub>-fixing rhizobia (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). Decades of research have identified an intricate network of coordinated gene functions required to establish a successful mutualistic interaction between rhizobia and legumes (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">â</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). In contrast to the core symbiotic machinery, most of which has been elucidated, much remains unknown about the accessory genes required to optimize the interaction.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to simple gene presence/absence, genotype-by-genotype (GxG) interactions have prominent impacts on symbiotic outcomes (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The importance of both the plant and bacterial genotypes, and their interaction, in optimizing symbioses between rhizobia and legumes was recognized in early population genetic studies (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">â</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). More recently, greenhouse studies have directly demonstrated the influence of GxG interactions on the fitness of both the plant and rhizobium partners (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a><a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29 B30"">â</a><a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). The newly developed select-and-resequence approach is providing a high-throughput approach to uncover the genetic basis underlying GxG interactions for fitness in rhizobium-legume symbioses as well as a way to screen for strain-specific effects of individual genes (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). To date, GxG interaction studies have largely focused on measurements of fitness as a holistic measure of the entire symbiotic process. Nodule formation is a complex developmental process involving several steps, each of which requires a distinct molecular toolkit (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), and in principle, distinct GxG interactions could be acting at each of these developmental stages. Transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that GxG interactions have significant impacts on the gene expression patterns of both partners in mature N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). However, we are unaware of studies specifically focusing on the role of GxG interactions in early developmental stages, such as during the initial perception of the partners by each other. Such knowledge is critical not only to fully understand the microevolution of host-associated bacteria but also to develop host variety-specific rhizobium bioinoculants that may ensure good nodulation abilities over unwanted (indigenous) rhizobial strains (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>, <a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we evaluated whether GxG interactions could be identified in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant. We worked with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span>, which is one of the best-studied models for GxG interactions in rhizobia. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> forms N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules on plants belonging to the tribe <i>Trigonelleae</i> (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), which includes alfalfa, a major forage crop grown worldwide for which many varieties have been developed (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genome comprises three main replicons, a chromosome, a chromid, and a megaplasmid; the latter one harbors most of the essential symbiotic functions, including the genes responsible for the initial molecular dialog with the host plant (<i>nod</i> genes) (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). To address our aim, the gene expression patterns of three strains of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (each with distinct symbiotic properties) following 4 h of exposure to root exudates derived from three alfalfa cultivated varieties were characterized using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptome following exposure to luteolin (a known inducer of <i>nod</i> genes, involved in the early steps of symbiotic interaction [<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>]) was also analyzed. Additionally, the relevance of the megaplasmid in defining the strain-specific transcriptional responses was analyzed by studying a hybrid <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain in which the native megaplasmid was replaced with that of another wild-type strain. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional response involved genes on all three replicons and that, even among conserved <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genes, transcriptional patterns were both strain and root exudate specific.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Symbiotic phenotypes differ across rhizobial strain-plant variety combinations.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Symbiotic phenotypes (plant growth and nodule number) and root adhesion of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains Rm1021, BL225C, and AK83 were measured during interactions with three varieties of alfalfa (Camporegio, Verbena, and Lodi). The results indicated that these phenotypes are influenced by both the plant and bacterial genotypes (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>; see also <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Root adhesion phenotypes (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1a</a>) were divided by the Scott-Knott test into three main groups reflecting high, medium, and low root colonization. Interestingly, each group was heterogeneous with respect to both plant variety and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain, consistent with the specificity of plant variety (i.e., genotype <i>sensu lato</i>) and strain individuality (i.e., strain genotype) pairs in root colonization efficiency. For instance, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C strongly colonized the roots of the Camporegio and Verbena varieties, but it displayed much weaker colonization of the Lodi cultivar. On the other hand, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83 colonized the Lodi and Camporegio varieties better than the Verbena cultivar. Nodules per plant as well as measures of symbiotic efficiency (epicotyl length and shoot dry weight) showed differences among the strain-variety combinations (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1b</a> to <a href=""#fig1"">d</a>). However, the extents of the variation were lower than those recorded for plant root adhesion. The highest number of nodules was found on the Lodi variety nodulated by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83, which was previously interpreted as a consequence of its reduced N<sub>2</sub> fixation ability with some alfalfa varieties (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a><a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">â</a><a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Interestingly, the measures of symbiotic efficiency did not correlate with root adhesion phenotypes (both adhesion versus dry weight and adhesion versus epicotyl length gave nonsignificant Pearson correlation values [<i>P</i> &gt; 0.18]). However, we cannot <i>a priori</i> exclude that measuring adhesion over the whole root might not reflect adhesion to the root hair extension zone, where rhizobia start the symbiotic interaction. For example, the largest plants were the Lodi variety inoculated with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C despite the root adhesion of this combination being the lowest. Similarly, the smallest plants were the Verbena variety inoculated with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 despite strong root adhesion in this pairing.</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Root exudates differ among alfalfa varieties.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the alfalfa root exudates detected a total of 2,688 unique features, including 392 annotated features, across the two platforms: 1,514 hydrophilic features were detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS in positive mode (PP) (288 annotated), and 1,174 hydrophilic features were detected by UPLC-MS in negative mode (PN) (104 annotated) (see worksheet 1 in <a href=""#dataS1"">Data Set S1</a> in the supplemental material). In order to clarify if the metabolite compositions of the root exudates from the alfalfa varieties differed, principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed on the two biological replicates of the three cultivars (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). The three cultivars clearly grouped separately from each other, suggesting the presence of variety-specific differences in their metabolic compositions. Peaks PP_23583, PP_25608, PP_14051, and PP_23300 were assigned by the PubChem database to liquiritigenin, apigenin, genistein, and apigeninidin, respectively; however, differences in the concentrations of these compounds between the root exudates were not statistically significant (data not shown). Most of the observed differences were related to amino acids, in particular <i>N</i>-acetyl-<span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-leucine, tryptophan, cytosine, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, and the dipeptide Val-Ala (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). Multiple flavones and flavonoids, which include known inducers of NodD activation (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>) and chemotaxis (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), were potentially identified. These include a peak hypothetically attributed to apigeninidin (PP_23300), which was found in the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates; liquiritigenin (PP_23583), which was found in the Camporegio and Lodi root exudates; as well as apigenin (PP_25608) and genistein (PP_14051), which were found in variable amounts in the root exudates from all three varieties. Elemental analysis (CHNS [carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur]) of root exudates was also performed (<a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>), and the results were used to normalize the quantity of root exudates used in the treatment of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains based on equalizing the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) added to each culture.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The global transcriptional responses of the three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> wild-type strains following a 4-h exposure to luteolin (the model flavone involved in the early steps of symbiotic interaction [<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>]) or alfalfa root exudates were evaluated using RNA sequencing.

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">In general, luteolin treatment resulted in the lowest number of DEGs, ranging from 36 to 149 per strain. Concerning the root exudates, the number of DEGs was influenced by both the strain and the alfalfa cultivar. Overall, the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates induced more gene expression changes than the Lodi root exudate. Cluster analyses of all genes that were differentially expressed under at least one condition (fold change of â¥2; adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.01) revealed that for each strain, the transcriptional responses to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates were similar and grouped separately from that of the Lodi cultivar (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3a</a>; <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> [see also supplemental File S1 at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q"">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q</a>]).

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Stimulons differ in the set of elicited functions.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Functional enrichment analyses, based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) modules and Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) categories, were performed to give a global overview of the functions of the DEGs (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a> [see also File S2 at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q"">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q</a>]). Strain- and condition-specific patterns of functional enrichment were observed, consistent with the functional differentiation of the stimulons from each experiment. Nevertheless, a core set of COG categories were commonly over- or underrepresented in all three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains during exposure to the Camporegio or Verbena root exudates. These included enrichment among the upregulated genes of COG categories J and O related to protein expression and modification, suggesting that the root exudates stimulated major remodeling of the proteome. In addition, for upregulated genes, COG category G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism) was underrepresented, while for the downregulated genes, COG category C (energy production and conversion) was overrepresented. This observation suggests that the root exudates stimulated a global change in the cellular energy production pathways versus growth in our standard minimal medium with succinate as the sole carbon source. A comparison with growth under soil-mimicking conditions would be interesting with respect to interpreting the root exudate-induced changes in an ecological context.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Among the most highly expressed genes in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 during exposure to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates were <i>smc03024</i> and <i>smc03028</i>, encoding components of the flagellar apparatus (<i>flgF</i> and <i>flgC</i>, respectively); the orthologs of these genes were not induced in BL225C or AK83 (<a href=""#dataS1"">Data Set S1</a>, worksheet 2). The induction of motility is in contrast to the observation that luteolin alone decreases the motility of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 strain (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Presumably, this reflects the presence of additional stimuli in the root exudates. Indeed, amino acids present in root exudates are known to stimulate chemotactic behavior in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), and signature-tagged mutagenesis showed that motility-related genes are relevant during competition for rhizosphere colonization by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differences in the transcriptomes of two <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</span> strains exposed to root exudates were suggested to be related to differences in their competitive abilities (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). We therefore examined the expression patterns of several genes likely to play a role in competition for rhizosphere colonization and root adhesion. It was previously suggested that the <i>sin</i> quorum sensing system is involved in competition in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>); in our data, <i>sinI</i> (<i>smc00168</i>) was repressed in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 in the presence of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates, but no changes in the expression of the orthologous genes in strain AK83 or BL225C were observed. No evidence was found in any of the strains for changes in the expression of galactoglucan or succinoglucan biosynthesis genes such as <i>wgaA</i> (<i>sm_b21319</i>) and <i>wgeA</i> (<i>sm_b21314</i>). The Verbena and Camporegio root exudates induced the expression of the rhizobactin transport gene (<i>sma2337</i> [<i>rhtX</i>]) of Rm1021 and BL225C; this gene is not found in AK83. This may be a consequence of the root exudates chelating the available iron (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), consequently eliciting siderophore production that can inhibit the growth of strains lacking siderophores (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>). Plasmid pSINME01 of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83 exhibits similarity with plasmid pHRC017 of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> C017, which confers a competitive advantage for nodule occupancy and host range restrictions (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>). Considering that a few of the genes on the plasmids pSINME01 and pSINME02 were differentially expressed upon exposure to root exudates, it is possible that the accessory plasmids of strain AK83 also contribute to competition for rhizosphere colonization (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differences in gene expression patterns across conditions may be related, in part, to differences in the presence of flavonoids. In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span>, it is known that root exudates containing flavone molecules activate the transcriptional regulator NodD (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), which triggers the synthesis of Nod factor required for nodule formation. To gain insight into the influence of NodD on the observed stimulons, we compared the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 data to those of the well-known regulons of NodD1 (requiring plant compounds for its activation) and NodD3 (not requiring plant compounds but relying on indirect activation through SyrM and NodD1 [<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>]) established previously (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>, <a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). We found that out of the 26 genes of the NodD1 regulon, 7 and 6 were observed in the DEGs in response to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates, respectively. Camporegio and Verbena root extracts putatively contained apigenin, while the Lodi root extract lacked apigenin, suggesting a role of apigenin in the differential expression pattern observed. For the 226 genes of the NodD3 regulon, 105, 104, and 4 were found in the DEGs in response to the Verbena, Camporegio, and Lodi root exudates, respectively. The presence of a partial overlap of the known <i>nod</i> regulons (â¼20% or fewer of the DEGs under each condition) suggests that most of the observed DEGs belong to <i>nod</i>-independent regulons. Moreover, some of these genes showed contrasting patterns of expression, suggesting that the root exudates may also contain antagonistic molecules that repress the <i>nod</i> regulon, as previously reported (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>, <a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Mobilization of the symbiotic megaplasmid results in nonadditive changes in stimulons.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To evaluate the impact of interreplicon epistatic interactions on the transcriptional response of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> to alfalfa root exudates, we used RNA-seq to characterize the response of a previously constructed <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> hybrid strain containing the symbiotic megaplasmid (pSINMEB01) of strain BL225C (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Cluster analyses clearly demonstrated that the transcriptome (both global and restricted to pSymA-pSINMEB01 orthologs only) of the hybrid strain differed from those of both the BL225C and Rm1021 wild-type strains under all conditions (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3b</a>; <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a>). Of particular interest were the results observed during exposure to the Lodi root exudate. We previously showed that alfalfa cv. Lodi plants inoculated with the hybrid strain were larger than those inoculated with either BL225C or Rm2011 (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Here, we observed that exposure to the Lodi root exudate results in more differentially expressed genes in the hybrid strain (98 genes) than in either Rm1021 or BL225C (32 and 76 genes, respectively) (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). In particular, a cluster of genes was specifically upregulated in the hybrid strain, and the majority of these genes were located on the symbiotic megaplasmid. This peculiar feature of the Lodi-induced transcriptome in the hybrid strain was also highlighted by the cluster analysis of pSymA-pSINMEB01 orthologs; only in the hybrid strain did the Lodi-induced expression profile cluster with those of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3b</a>). The presence of these (possibly nonadditive) transcriptional changes may reflect a loss of <i>cis</i>-regulation of these megaplasmid genes by chromosomal regulators (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>, <a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), providing a potential molecular mechanism underlying the improved symbiotic phenotype of the hybrid compared to both wild-type strains.</div>

</div></aside></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Rhizobium-legume interactions are complex multistep phenomena that begin with an exchange of signals between two partners (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>). The rhizobia initially detect the plant through the perception of flavonoids in the root exudate of legumes by NodD proteins, which then triggers the production of lipochitooligosaccharide molecules known as Nod factors. Nod factors are then recognized by specific LysM receptor kinase proteins in plant root cells, triggering the symbiosis signaling pathway and initiating the formation of a nodule. However, root exudates contain a mixture of flavonoids, some of them having different agonistic activities on NodD (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Root exudates also contain many other molecules that can serve as signals or support rhizobium metabolism, such as amino acids and sugars, that may influence the ability of rhizobia to successfully colonize the rhizosphere and be in a position to enter the symbiosis (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>, <a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>). Consequently, interactions between plant and rhizobium genotypes are expected to influence the success of the initial interaction between the two partners.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Previous works have identified a clear role for GxG interactions in the partnership between <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Medicago truncatula</span> (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>), demonstrating that aerial biomass was influenced by the plant and rhizobium genotypes as well as their interaction. Here, we demonstrated that GxG interactions also have a significant impact on the adherence of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains to alfalfa roots, as a representative phenotype for an early stage of the interaction between these partners. Rhizosphere colonization appears to have a direct impact on nodule colonization (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>, <a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>); while our data do not address if root adhesion is correlated with competition for nodule occupancy in mixed inocula, they suggest that root adhesion is poorly correlated with overall symbiotic efficiency in single-inoculum studies. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of GxG interactions on the nodule transcriptome of <i>Medicago</i>-<i>Sinorhizobium</i> symbioses (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). Here, we showed that GxG interactions similarly have an important contribution in determining the transcriptional response of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> to the detection of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Medicago sativa</span> root exudates. Together, these results demonstrate that GxG interactions have a meaningful impact on the outcome of rhizobium-legume symbioses at multiple stages of development.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The exposure of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. diazoefficiens</span> to soybean root exudates resulted in changes in the expression of 450 genes, representing nearly 5.6% of the genome, and the impacts of soybean root exudates differed between the two tested <i>B. diazoefficiens</i> strains (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Similarly, between 0.5% and 20% of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genes were differentially expressed following exposure to alfalfa root exudates, depending on the host-symbiont combination. The similarities/differences in the responses of the three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains to treatments did not appear to depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the strains (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>), although this cannot be definitively concluded without analysis of additional strains. Nevertheless, these results emphasize the importance of transcriptional rewiring during strain diversification in bacteria (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>). Similarly, studies with eukaryotic organisms indicate that adaptation has an important role in differentiating the gene expression patterns of organisms (<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a>, <a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The root exudate stimulons only partially overlapped the stimulons of luteolin, a known inducer of NodD in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), confirming that alfalfa root exudates contain numerous molecular signals aside from flavonoids that may influence the competitiveness of various rhizobium strains. Importantly, the transcriptional patterns induced by alfalfa root exudates differed depending on the cultivar from which they were collected; whether these differences are adaptive requires further investigation. Additionally, although root exudate metabolomic analysis was mainly descriptive, and relatively few peaks could be identified, there was a similar pattern between the differences in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> gene expression profiles and the overall chemical similarity of the root exudates as measured by LC-MS; the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates induced similar gene expression changes while also being similar along the second principal component of variance (accounting for 30% of the variance) in the PCA of the root exudate composition. In future work, it would be interesting to define which compounds in the root exudates have the greatest impact on the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> transcriptome.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to the impact of GxG interactions on rhizobium-legume symbioses, there is the potential for interreplicon interactions within rhizobium genomes to further influence the symbiosis. Indeed, interreplicon epistatic interactions are abundant in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genome (<a href=""#B71"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B71"">71</a>). To address the contribution of interreplicon interactions to symbiosis, we examined a hybrid strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm2011 (a strain nearly identical to Rm1021 [<a href=""#B72"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B72"">72</a>]) was replaced with the symbiotic megaplasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C. Nonadditive effects on the transcriptional profiles associated with all three replicons were observed in the hybrid strain relative to Rm1021 and BL225C, indicating that megaplasmid mobilization induced a global rewiring of gene expression, likely due to transcriptional cross talk among the replicons (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>, <a href=""#B73"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B73"">73</a>). Similarly, nonadditive effects on the transcriptome of plant hybrids have been extensively explored (<a href=""#B74"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B74"">74</a>) and demonstrated as one of the bases for heterosis in crops (<a href=""#B75"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B75"">75</a>). In previous work looking for regulatory modules where the transcription factor and target genes reside on different replicons in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), we found 17 transcriptional regulators encoded by the chromosome or chromid with predicted target genes on the megaplasmid. Among those transcription factors, systems related to exopolysaccharide production (ExpG), transport (PcaQ), and metabolism (IolR and GlnBK) were present, supporting the hypothesis of a global rewiring of gene expression networks and a wide range of effects of this rewiring. The results with the hybrid led us to hypothesize that the large symbiotic variability observed in natural <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> isolates may partly be related to genome-wide transcriptome changes following large-scale horizontal gene transfer followed by natural selection. Moreover, we speculate that while the megaplasmid is the key element for a general response (i.e., cultivar independent) to species-specific host plant associations, the rhizobium chromosome and chromid fine-tune these responses in a genotype-dependent manner. If true, however, this would limit our ability to predict the competitiveness of rhizobium isolates from their simple genome sequence; instead, a more complex understanding of global regulatory network control would be required.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the initial perception of legumes by rhizobia leads to hundreds of changes in the rhizobium transcriptome and that these changes are dependent on the plant genotype, the rhizobium genotype, and genotype-by-genotype interactions. These results complement previous studies demonstrating the role of GxG interactions in determining the transcriptome of both the legume and rhizobium partners in mature N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). The majority of genes upregulated in response to alfalfa root exudates were conserved in all three strains, supporting the hypothesis that the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> lineage was adapted to rhizosphere colonization before gaining the genes required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). Additionally, the transcriptional response to the perception of alfalfa root exudates involved genes from all three of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> replicons and seemingly involved nonadditive effects resulting from interreplicon interactions.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">Root exudates were produced by growing plants under sterile conditions in water for 14âdays, as previously reported (<a href=""#B79"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B79"">79</a>) and as reported in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>. Elemental analysis (CHNS) was performed on crude root exudates (a combined sample for each cultivar) using a carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyzer (CHN-S Flash E1112; Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). Metabolomic analysis was performed by LC-MS, and data from reverse-phase UPLC (RP-UPLC) and UPLC-MS were combined to build the final data matrix. Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity obtained from each peak identification (ID) value (<a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>). Statistical differences in single metabolites were assessed by Simper analysis based on the decomposition of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity obtained from each peak ID value. All statistical analyses were done with the vegan package of R (<a href=""#B80"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B80"">80</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">Cultures of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span>, grown overnight in M9-succinate medium at 30Â°C at 130ârpm, were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.05 in 5âml of M9-succinate medium and incubated until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 was reached. Next, either 10 Î¼M luteolin (Sigma-Aldrich) or one of the alfalfa root exudates (normalized by the total organic carbon as measured by the CHNS analysis) was added to each of the cultures, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 4âh at 30Â°C with shaking at 130ârpm. Biological replicates were performed for each of the three strains across the five conditions. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy minikits (Qiagen) from 0.5âml of the culture and subjected to DNase I treatment. Details on the RNA isolation procedure and quality checks are provided in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>. Validation of expression differences was done using reverse transcriptase qPCR as described in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>.

<div role=""paragraph"">For each <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain, genes differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub> fold change of â¥1; <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.01) under at least one condition relative to the control conditions were identified, and all fold change values for these genes were extracted. To compare expression values of genes conserved between Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C, the pangenome of the three strains was calculated using Roary version 3.13.0 (<a href=""#B84"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B84"">84</a>) with an identity threshold of 90%, and the genes found in all three strains (the core genes) were recorded.

<div role=""paragraph"">All genes of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C were functionally annotated using stand-alone version 2 of eggNOG-mapper (<a href=""#B85"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B85"">85</a>, <a href=""#B86"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B86"">86</a>) with default settings and the following two modifications: the mode was set to diamond, and query cover was set to 20.

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> A sustainable way for meeting the need of an increased global food demand should be based on a holobiont perspective, viewing crop plants as intimately associated with their microbiome, which helps improve plant nutrition, tolerance to pests, and adverse climate conditions. However, the genetic repertoire needed for efficient association with plants by the microbial symbionts is still poorly understood. The rhizobia are an exemplary model of facultative plant symbiotic microbes. Here, we evaluated whether genotype-by-genotype interactions could be identified in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant. We performed an RNA sequencing study to analyze the transcriptomes of different rhizobial strains elicited by root exudates of three alfalfa varieties as a proxy of an early step of the symbiotic interaction. The results indicated strain- and plant variety-dependent variability in the observed transcriptional changes, providing fundamentally novel insights into the genetic basis of rhizobium-plant interactions. Our results provide genetic insights and perspective to aid in the exploitation of natural rhizobium variation for improvement of legume growth in agricultural ecosystems.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbes play a crucial role in the biology and evolution of their eukaryotic hosts (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Among other activities, microbes contribute to the hostâs acquisition of nutrients (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), functioning of the hostâs immune system (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>), and protection of the host from predation (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). The rules governing host-microbe interactions remain a topic of intense investigation. In many cases, the eukaryotic host selectively recruits the desired microbial partner: squid light organs are selectively colonized by <i>Vibrio</i> symbionts (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), legumes select for effective symbionts by sanctioning noneffective symbionts (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>), and the crop microbiome is cultivar dependent (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The genetic basis determining the quality of a microbial symbiont (i.e., its ability to improve host plant phenotypes such as growth and tolerance) and its ability to effectively colonize its eukaryotic partner is generally not well understood, but evolution experiments and high-throughput genome sequencing projects of host-associated microbes and complete microbiomes are shedding light on this topic (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10 B11 B12 B13"">â</a><a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). In the case of plants, such studies have observed an enrichment of certain gene functions in plant-associated microbes, such as genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, secretion systems, phytohormone production, and phosphorus solubilization (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The rhizobia are an ecologically important exemplar of facultative host-associated microbes. These soil-dwelling bacteria are able to colonize plants and enter an endosymbiotic association with plants of the family <i>Fabaceae</i> (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). This developmentally complex process begins with an exchange of signals between the free-living organisms (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>), which leads to the invasion of the plant by the rhizobia (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), and culminates in the formation of a new organ (a nodule) in which the plant cells are intracellularly colonized by N<sub>2</sub>-fixing rhizobia (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). Decades of research have identified an intricate network of coordinated gene functions required to establish a successful mutualistic interaction between rhizobia and legumes (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">â</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). In contrast to the core symbiotic machinery, most of which has been elucidated, much remains unknown about the accessory genes required to optimize the interaction.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to simple gene presence/absence, genotype-by-genotype (GxG) interactions have prominent impacts on symbiotic outcomes (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The importance of both the plant and bacterial genotypes, and their interaction, in optimizing symbioses between rhizobia and legumes was recognized in early population genetic studies (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">â</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). More recently, greenhouse studies have directly demonstrated the influence of GxG interactions on the fitness of both the plant and rhizobium partners (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a><a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29 B30"">â</a><a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). The newly developed select-and-resequence approach is providing a high-throughput approach to uncover the genetic basis underlying GxG interactions for fitness in rhizobium-legume symbioses as well as a way to screen for strain-specific effects of individual genes (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). To date, GxG interaction studies have largely focused on measurements of fitness as a holistic measure of the entire symbiotic process. Nodule formation is a complex developmental process involving several steps, each of which requires a distinct molecular toolkit (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), and in principle, distinct GxG interactions could be acting at each of these developmental stages. Transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that GxG interactions have significant impacts on the gene expression patterns of both partners in mature N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). However, we are unaware of studies specifically focusing on the role of GxG interactions in early developmental stages, such as during the initial perception of the partners by each other. Such knowledge is critical not only to fully understand the microevolution of host-associated bacteria but also to develop host variety-specific rhizobium bioinoculants that may ensure good nodulation abilities over unwanted (indigenous) rhizobial strains (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>, <a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we evaluated whether GxG interactions could be identified in the initial transcriptional response of rhizobium perception of a host plant. We worked with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sinorhizobium meliloti</span>, which is one of the best-studied models for GxG interactions in rhizobia. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> forms N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules on plants belonging to the tribe <i>Trigonelleae</i> (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), which includes alfalfa, a major forage crop grown worldwide for which many varieties have been developed (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genome comprises three main replicons, a chromosome, a chromid, and a megaplasmid; the latter one harbors most of the essential symbiotic functions, including the genes responsible for the initial molecular dialog with the host plant (<i>nod</i> genes) (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). To address our aim, the gene expression patterns of three strains of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (each with distinct symbiotic properties) following 4 h of exposure to root exudates derived from three alfalfa cultivated varieties were characterized using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptome following exposure to luteolin (a known inducer of <i>nod</i> genes, involved in the early steps of symbiotic interaction [<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>]) was also analyzed. Additionally, the relevance of the megaplasmid in defining the strain-specific transcriptional responses was analyzed by studying a hybrid <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain in which the native megaplasmid was replaced with that of another wild-type strain. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional response involved genes on all three replicons and that, even among conserved <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genes, transcriptional patterns were both strain and root exudate specific.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Symbiotic phenotypes differ across rhizobial strain-plant variety combinations.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Symbiotic phenotypes (plant growth and nodule number) and root adhesion of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains Rm1021, BL225C, and AK83 were measured during interactions with three varieties of alfalfa (Camporegio, Verbena, and Lodi). The results indicated that these phenotypes are influenced by both the plant and bacterial genotypes (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>; see also <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Root adhesion phenotypes (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1a</a>) were divided by the Scott-Knott test into three main groups reflecting high, medium, and low root colonization. Interestingly, each group was heterogeneous with respect to both plant variety and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain, consistent with the specificity of plant variety (i.e., genotype <i>sensu lato</i>) and strain individuality (i.e., strain genotype) pairs in root colonization efficiency. For instance, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C strongly colonized the roots of the Camporegio and Verbena varieties, but it displayed much weaker colonization of the Lodi cultivar. On the other hand, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83 colonized the Lodi and Camporegio varieties better than the Verbena cultivar. Nodules per plant as well as measures of symbiotic efficiency (epicotyl length and shoot dry weight) showed differences among the strain-variety combinations (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1b</a> to <a href=""#fig1"">d</a>). However, the extents of the variation were lower than those recorded for plant root adhesion. The highest number of nodules was found on the Lodi variety nodulated by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83, which was previously interpreted as a consequence of its reduced N<sub>2</sub> fixation ability with some alfalfa varieties (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a><a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">â</a><a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Interestingly, the measures of symbiotic efficiency did not correlate with root adhesion phenotypes (both adhesion versus dry weight and adhesion versus epicotyl length gave nonsignificant Pearson correlation values [<i>P</i> &gt; 0.18]). However, we cannot <i>a priori</i> exclude that measuring adhesion over the whole root might not reflect adhesion to the root hair extension zone, where rhizobia start the symbiotic interaction. For example, the largest plants were the Lodi variety inoculated with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C despite the root adhesion of this combination being the lowest. Similarly, the smallest plants were the Verbena variety inoculated with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 despite strong root adhesion in this pairing.</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Root exudates differ among alfalfa varieties.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the alfalfa root exudates detected a total of 2,688 unique features, including 392 annotated features, across the two platforms: 1,514 hydrophilic features were detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS in positive mode (PP) (288 annotated), and 1,174 hydrophilic features were detected by UPLC-MS in negative mode (PN) (104 annotated) (see worksheet 1 in <a href=""#dataS1"">Data Set S1</a> in the supplemental material). In order to clarify if the metabolite compositions of the root exudates from the alfalfa varieties differed, principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed on the two biological replicates of the three cultivars (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). The three cultivars clearly grouped separately from each other, suggesting the presence of variety-specific differences in their metabolic compositions. Peaks PP_23583, PP_25608, PP_14051, and PP_23300 were assigned by the PubChem database to liquiritigenin, apigenin, genistein, and apigeninidin, respectively; however, differences in the concentrations of these compounds between the root exudates were not statistically significant (data not shown). Most of the observed differences were related to amino acids, in particular <i>N</i>-acetyl-<span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-leucine, tryptophan, cytosine, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, and the dipeptide Val-Ala (<a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). Multiple flavones and flavonoids, which include known inducers of NodD activation (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>) and chemotaxis (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), were potentially identified. These include a peak hypothetically attributed to apigeninidin (PP_23300), which was found in the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates; liquiritigenin (PP_23583), which was found in the Camporegio and Lodi root exudates; as well as apigenin (PP_25608) and genistein (PP_14051), which were found in variable amounts in the root exudates from all three varieties. Elemental analysis (CHNS [carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur]) of root exudates was also performed (<a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>), and the results were used to normalize the quantity of root exudates used in the treatment of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains based on equalizing the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) added to each culture.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">In general, luteolin treatment resulted in the lowest number of DEGs, ranging from 36 to 149 per strain. Concerning the root exudates, the number of DEGs was influenced by both the strain and the alfalfa cultivar. Overall, the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates induced more gene expression changes than the Lodi root exudate. Cluster analyses of all genes that were differentially expressed under at least one condition (fold change of â¥2; adjusted <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.01) revealed that for each strain, the transcriptional responses to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates were similar and grouped separately from that of the Lodi cultivar (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3a</a>; <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> [see also supplemental File S1 at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q"">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q</a>]).

<div role=""paragraph"">Functional enrichment analyses, based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) modules and Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) categories, were performed to give a global overview of the functions of the DEGs (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a> [see also File S2 at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q"">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jdfn2z38q</a>]). Strain- and condition-specific patterns of functional enrichment were observed, consistent with the functional differentiation of the stimulons from each experiment. Nevertheless, a core set of COG categories were commonly over- or underrepresented in all three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains during exposure to the Camporegio or Verbena root exudates. These included enrichment among the upregulated genes of COG categories J and O related to protein expression and modification, suggesting that the root exudates stimulated major remodeling of the proteome. In addition, for upregulated genes, COG category G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism) was underrepresented, while for the downregulated genes, COG category C (energy production and conversion) was overrepresented. This observation suggests that the root exudates stimulated a global change in the cellular energy production pathways versus growth in our standard minimal medium with succinate as the sole carbon source. A comparison with growth under soil-mimicking conditions would be interesting with respect to interpreting the root exudate-induced changes in an ecological context.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Among the most highly expressed genes in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 during exposure to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates were <i>smc03024</i> and <i>smc03028</i>, encoding components of the flagellar apparatus (<i>flgF</i> and <i>flgC</i>, respectively); the orthologs of these genes were not induced in BL225C or AK83 (<a href=""#dataS1"">Data Set S1</a>, worksheet 2). The induction of motility is in contrast to the observation that luteolin alone decreases the motility of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 strain (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Presumably, this reflects the presence of additional stimuli in the root exudates. Indeed, amino acids present in root exudates are known to stimulate chemotactic behavior in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), and signature-tagged mutagenesis showed that motility-related genes are relevant during competition for rhizosphere colonization by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differences in the transcriptomes of two <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</span> strains exposed to root exudates were suggested to be related to differences in their competitive abilities (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). We therefore examined the expression patterns of several genes likely to play a role in competition for rhizosphere colonization and root adhesion. It was previously suggested that the <i>sin</i> quorum sensing system is involved in competition in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>); in our data, <i>sinI</i> (<i>smc00168</i>) was repressed in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 in the presence of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates, but no changes in the expression of the orthologous genes in strain AK83 or BL225C were observed. No evidence was found in any of the strains for changes in the expression of galactoglucan or succinoglucan biosynthesis genes such as <i>wgaA</i> (<i>sm_b21319</i>) and <i>wgeA</i> (<i>sm_b21314</i>). The Verbena and Camporegio root exudates induced the expression of the rhizobactin transport gene (<i>sma2337</i> [<i>rhtX</i>]) of Rm1021 and BL225C; this gene is not found in AK83. This may be a consequence of the root exudates chelating the available iron (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), consequently eliciting siderophore production that can inhibit the growth of strains lacking siderophores (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>). Plasmid pSINME01 of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> AK83 exhibits similarity with plasmid pHRC017 of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> C017, which confers a competitive advantage for nodule occupancy and host range restrictions (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>). Considering that a few of the genes on the plasmids pSINME01 and pSINME02 were differentially expressed upon exposure to root exudates, it is possible that the accessory plasmids of strain AK83 also contribute to competition for rhizosphere colonization (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differences in gene expression patterns across conditions may be related, in part, to differences in the presence of flavonoids. In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span>, it is known that root exudates containing flavone molecules activate the transcriptional regulator NodD (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), which triggers the synthesis of Nod factor required for nodule formation. To gain insight into the influence of NodD on the observed stimulons, we compared the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 data to those of the well-known regulons of NodD1 (requiring plant compounds for its activation) and NodD3 (not requiring plant compounds but relying on indirect activation through SyrM and NodD1 [<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>]) established previously (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>, <a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). We found that out of the 26 genes of the NodD1 regulon, 7 and 6 were observed in the DEGs in response to the Verbena and Camporegio root exudates, respectively. Camporegio and Verbena root extracts putatively contained apigenin, while the Lodi root extract lacked apigenin, suggesting a role of apigenin in the differential expression pattern observed. For the 226 genes of the NodD3 regulon, 105, 104, and 4 were found in the DEGs in response to the Verbena, Camporegio, and Lodi root exudates, respectively. The presence of a partial overlap of the known <i>nod</i> regulons (â¼20% or fewer of the DEGs under each condition) suggests that most of the observed DEGs belong to <i>nod</i>-independent regulons. Moreover, some of these genes showed contrasting patterns of expression, suggesting that the root exudates may also contain antagonistic molecules that repress the <i>nod</i> regulon, as previously reported (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>, <a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Mobilization of the symbiotic megaplasmid results in nonadditive changes in stimulons.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To evaluate the impact of interreplicon epistatic interactions on the transcriptional response of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> to alfalfa root exudates, we used RNA-seq to characterize the response of a previously constructed <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> hybrid strain containing the symbiotic megaplasmid (pSINMEB01) of strain BL225C (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Cluster analyses clearly demonstrated that the transcriptome (both global and restricted to pSymA-pSINMEB01 orthologs only) of the hybrid strain differed from those of both the BL225C and Rm1021 wild-type strains under all conditions (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3b</a>; <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a>). Of particular interest were the results observed during exposure to the Lodi root exudate. We previously showed that alfalfa cv. Lodi plants inoculated with the hybrid strain were larger than those inoculated with either BL225C or Rm2011 (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Here, we observed that exposure to the Lodi root exudate results in more differentially expressed genes in the hybrid strain (98 genes) than in either Rm1021 or BL225C (32 and 76 genes, respectively) (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). In particular, a cluster of genes was specifically upregulated in the hybrid strain, and the majority of these genes were located on the symbiotic megaplasmid. This peculiar feature of the Lodi-induced transcriptome in the hybrid strain was also highlighted by the cluster analysis of pSymA-pSINMEB01 orthologs; only in the hybrid strain did the Lodi-induced expression profile cluster with those of the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3b</a>). The presence of these (possibly nonadditive) transcriptional changes may reflect a loss of <i>cis</i>-regulation of these megaplasmid genes by chromosomal regulators (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>, <a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), providing a potential molecular mechanism underlying the improved symbiotic phenotype of the hybrid compared to both wild-type strains.</div>

</div></aside></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Rhizobium-legume interactions are complex multistep phenomena that begin with an exchange of signals between two partners (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>). The rhizobia initially detect the plant through the perception of flavonoids in the root exudate of legumes by NodD proteins, which then triggers the production of lipochitooligosaccharide molecules known as Nod factors. Nod factors are then recognized by specific LysM receptor kinase proteins in plant root cells, triggering the symbiosis signaling pathway and initiating the formation of a nodule. However, root exudates contain a mixture of flavonoids, some of them having different agonistic activities on NodD (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Root exudates also contain many other molecules that can serve as signals or support rhizobium metabolism, such as amino acids and sugars, that may influence the ability of rhizobia to successfully colonize the rhizosphere and be in a position to enter the symbiosis (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>, <a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>). Consequently, interactions between plant and rhizobium genotypes are expected to influence the success of the initial interaction between the two partners.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Previous works have identified a clear role for GxG interactions in the partnership between <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Medicago truncatula</span> (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>), demonstrating that aerial biomass was influenced by the plant and rhizobium genotypes as well as their interaction. Here, we demonstrated that GxG interactions also have a significant impact on the adherence of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains to alfalfa roots, as a representative phenotype for an early stage of the interaction between these partners. Rhizosphere colonization appears to have a direct impact on nodule colonization (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>, <a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>); while our data do not address if root adhesion is correlated with competition for nodule occupancy in mixed inocula, they suggest that root adhesion is poorly correlated with overall symbiotic efficiency in single-inoculum studies. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of GxG interactions on the nodule transcriptome of <i>Medicago</i>-<i>Sinorhizobium</i> symbioses (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). Here, we showed that GxG interactions similarly have an important contribution in determining the transcriptional response of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> to the detection of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Medicago sativa</span> root exudates. Together, these results demonstrate that GxG interactions have a meaningful impact on the outcome of rhizobium-legume symbioses at multiple stages of development.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The exposure of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. diazoefficiens</span> to soybean root exudates resulted in changes in the expression of 450 genes, representing nearly 5.6% of the genome, and the impacts of soybean root exudates differed between the two tested <i>B. diazoefficiens</i> strains (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Similarly, between 0.5% and 20% of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genes were differentially expressed following exposure to alfalfa root exudates, depending on the host-symbiont combination. The similarities/differences in the responses of the three <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains to treatments did not appear to depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the strains (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>), although this cannot be definitively concluded without analysis of additional strains. Nevertheless, these results emphasize the importance of transcriptional rewiring during strain diversification in bacteria (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>). Similarly, studies with eukaryotic organisms indicate that adaptation has an important role in differentiating the gene expression patterns of organisms (<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a>, <a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The root exudate stimulons only partially overlapped the stimulons of luteolin, a known inducer of NodD in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), confirming that alfalfa root exudates contain numerous molecular signals aside from flavonoids that may influence the competitiveness of various rhizobium strains. Importantly, the transcriptional patterns induced by alfalfa root exudates differed depending on the cultivar from which they were collected; whether these differences are adaptive requires further investigation. Additionally, although root exudate metabolomic analysis was mainly descriptive, and relatively few peaks could be identified, there was a similar pattern between the differences in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> gene expression profiles and the overall chemical similarity of the root exudates as measured by LC-MS; the Camporegio and Verbena root exudates induced similar gene expression changes while also being similar along the second principal component of variance (accounting for 30% of the variance) in the PCA of the root exudate composition. In future work, it would be interesting to define which compounds in the root exudates have the greatest impact on the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> transcriptome.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to the impact of GxG interactions on rhizobium-legume symbioses, there is the potential for interreplicon interactions within rhizobium genomes to further influence the symbiosis. Indeed, interreplicon epistatic interactions are abundant in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> genome (<a href=""#B71"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B71"">71</a>). To address the contribution of interreplicon interactions to symbiosis, we examined a hybrid strain in which the symbiotic megaplasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm2011 (a strain nearly identical to Rm1021 [<a href=""#B72"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B72"">72</a>]) was replaced with the symbiotic megaplasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> BL225C. Nonadditive effects on the transcriptional profiles associated with all three replicons were observed in the hybrid strain relative to Rm1021 and BL225C, indicating that megaplasmid mobilization induced a global rewiring of gene expression, likely due to transcriptional cross talk among the replicons (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>, <a href=""#B73"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B73"">73</a>). Similarly, nonadditive effects on the transcriptome of plant hybrids have been extensively explored (<a href=""#B74"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B74"">74</a>) and demonstrated as one of the bases for heterosis in crops (<a href=""#B75"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B75"">75</a>). In previous work looking for regulatory modules where the transcription factor and target genes reside on different replicons in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> Rm1021 (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), we found 17 transcriptional regulators encoded by the chromosome or chromid with predicted target genes on the megaplasmid. Among those transcription factors, systems related to exopolysaccharide production (ExpG), transport (PcaQ), and metabolism (IolR and GlnBK) were present, supporting the hypothesis of a global rewiring of gene expression networks and a wide range of effects of this rewiring. The results with the hybrid led us to hypothesize that the large symbiotic variability observed in natural <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> isolates may partly be related to genome-wide transcriptome changes following large-scale horizontal gene transfer followed by natural selection. Moreover, we speculate that while the megaplasmid is the key element for a general response (i.e., cultivar independent) to species-specific host plant associations, the rhizobium chromosome and chromid fine-tune these responses in a genotype-dependent manner. If true, however, this would limit our ability to predict the competitiveness of rhizobium isolates from their simple genome sequence; instead, a more complex understanding of global regulatory network control would be required.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the initial perception of legumes by rhizobia leads to hundreds of changes in the rhizobium transcriptome and that these changes are dependent on the plant genotype, the rhizobium genotype, and genotype-by-genotype interactions. These results complement previous studies demonstrating the role of GxG interactions in determining the transcriptome of both the legume and rhizobium partners in mature N<sub>2</sub>-fixing nodules (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). The majority of genes upregulated in response to alfalfa root exudates were conserved in all three strains, supporting the hypothesis that the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> lineage was adapted to rhizosphere colonization before gaining the genes required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). Additionally, the transcriptional response to the perception of alfalfa root exudates involved genes from all three of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> replicons and seemingly involved nonadditive effects resulting from interreplicon interactions.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">A list of strains, their host plants of origin, as well as the plant varieties used is reported in <a href=""#tabS4"">TableÂ S4</a> in the supplemental material.

<div role=""paragraph"">Root exudates were produced by growing plants under sterile conditions in water for 14âdays, as previously reported (<a href=""#B79"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B79"">79</a>) and as reported in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>. Elemental analysis (CHNS) was performed on crude root exudates (a combined sample for each cultivar) using a carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyzer (CHN-S Flash E1112; Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). Metabolomic analysis was performed by LC-MS, and data from reverse-phase UPLC (RP-UPLC) and UPLC-MS were combined to build the final data matrix. Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity obtained from each peak identification (ID) value (<a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>). Statistical differences in single metabolites were assessed by Simper analysis based on the decomposition of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity obtained from each peak ID value. All statistical analyses were done with the vegan package of R (<a href=""#B80"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B80"">80</a>). The PubChem database was used for additional peak identification from brute formulas (<a href=""https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>RNA isolation and RNA sequencing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Cultures of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span>, grown overnight in M9-succinate medium at 30Â°C at 130ârpm, were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.05 in 5âml of M9-succinate medium and incubated until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 was reached. Next, either 10 Î¼M luteolin (Sigma-Aldrich) or one of the alfalfa root exudates (normalized by the total organic carbon as measured by the CHNS analysis) was added to each of the cultures, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 4âh at 30Â°C with shaking at 130ârpm. Biological replicates were performed for each of the three strains across the five conditions. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy minikits (Qiagen) from 0.5âml of the culture and subjected to DNase I treatment. Details on the RNA isolation procedure and quality checks are provided in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>. Validation of expression differences was done using reverse transcriptase qPCR as described in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>.

<div role=""paragraph"">Trimmed and demultiplexed reads were mapped back to transcripts using Salmon (version 1.1.0) (<a href=""#B81"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B81"">81</a>) (see <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a> for details). Quantification files produced by Salmon were then imported into R using the tximport package (version 1.10.1) (<a href=""#B82"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B82"">82</a>). Differential abundance analysis was performed with the DESeq2 version 1.22.2 package (<a href=""#B83"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B83"">83</a>) on single strains under different conditions.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>Statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">For each <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strain, genes differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub> fold change of â¥1; <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.01) under at least one condition relative to the control conditions were identified, and all fold change values for these genes were extracted. To compare expression values of genes conserved between Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C, the pangenome of the three strains was calculated using Roary version 3.13.0 (<a href=""#B84"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B84"">84</a>) with an identity threshold of 90%, and the genes found in all three strains (the core genes) were recorded. Under each condition, core genes differentially expressed in at least one strain relative to the control conditions were identified, and the fold change values for the gene and its orthologs in the other strains were extracted.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">All genes of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. meliloti</span> strains Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C were functionally annotated using stand-alone version 2 of eggNOG-mapper (<a href=""#B85"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B85"">85</a>, <a href=""#B86"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B86"">86</a>) with default settings and the following two modifications: the mode was set to diamond, and query cover was set to 20. Methods for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) category annotations are reported in <a href=""#textS1"">Text S1</a>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nested likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were used to evaluate the statistical significance of strain, condition, and strain-by-condition interaction effects on gene expression. Transcripts were collapsed into orthologous groups based on the output of Roary, as described above. Counts produced by Salmon were collapsed following the group ID provided by Roary, producing a single table with ortholog-level quantification of transcripts. The produced table was then used to perform a nested LRT with DESeq2. Strains and conditions were used together with their interaction to build a model for each group. Terms were then removed one by one to test their impact on the likelihood of the full model (as described in the DESeq2 documentation at <a href=""http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#likelihood-ratio-test"">http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#likelihood-ratio-test</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3>Data availability.</h3>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jmbe.v16i1.890","<div role=""paragraph"">The use of class-response systems such as the Clickers to promote active-learning during lectures has been wide-spread. However, the often-used MCQ format in class activities as well as in assessments for large classes might lower studentsâ expectations and attitudes towards learning. Here, I describe my experience converting MCQs to constructed-response questions for in-class learning activities by removing cues from the MCQs. From the responses submitted, students seemed capable of providing answers without the need for cues. Using class-response systems such as Socrative for such constructed-response questions could be useful to challenge students to express their ideas in their own words.

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Classroom response systems such as clickers (<a href=""#b2-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b2-jmbe-16-87"">2</a>) can help promote active learning during large-class lectures (<a href=""#b4-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b4-jmbe-16-87"">4</a>, <a href=""#b8-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b8-jmbe-16-87"">8</a>, <a href=""#b9-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b9-jmbe-16-87"">9</a>, <a href=""#b10-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b10-jmbe-16-87"">10</a>). While the use of clickers was well-received in my modules (<a href=""#b16-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b16-jmbe-16-87"">16</a>), the numeric keypad clickers restricted question formats to either multiple-choice questions (MCQs) or True/False questions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">MCQ-based assessments are common in large-class modules, given their cost-effectiveness (<a href=""#b12-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b12-jmbe-16-87"">12</a>). Consequently, students in large cohorts are often exposed to MCQs in learning and assessment settings. However, MCQs with accompanying cues might give students the impression that assessments are less than challenging (<a href=""#b14-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b14-jmbe-16-87"">14</a>), and could lower studentsâ chances of developing higher-order thinking skills. Furthermore, it is not easy to design good MCQs to evaluate student learning reliably (<a href=""#b3-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b3-jmbe-16-87"">3</a>, <a href=""#b6-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b6-jmbe-16-87"">6</a>). This has implications for large classes that generally have fewer opportunities for students to practice constructing their answers.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To reduce our over-reliance on MCQs in assessments, we had included essay assignments in our second-year undergraduate Cell Biology module, with individual feedback provided for each essay (<a href=""#b17-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b17-jmbe-16-87"">17</a>, <a href=""#b18-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b18-jmbe-16-87"">18</a>). With 300 students, however, it was impossible to give more than one major essay assignment per lecturer and provide sufficient feedback to students throughout the module.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">I therefore incorporated constructed-response questions to encourage students to synthesize answers in their own words during my Cell Biology lectures, where I can provide formative feedback to their written responses. These questions were designed to promote active and collaborative learning (<a href=""#b15-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b15-jmbe-16-87"">15</a>) and help students learn to construct knowledge on their own (<a href=""#b16-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b16-jmbe-16-87"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, I describe my experience converting MCQs to constructed-response questions for in-class learning activities by removing cues from the MCQs. From the responses submitted, students seemed capable of providing answers without the need for cues. Using class-response systems such as Socrative for such constructed-response questions could be useful to challenge students to express their ideas in their own words. Moreover, allowing students to construct their own answers could reveal misconceptions, which then could be corrected in a timely manner.</div></section><section id=""sec-2""><h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Use of Socrative</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The beta version of Socrative (<a href=""http://beta.Socrative.com/"">http://beta.Socrative.com/</a>) is a free, web-based classroom-response system that easily allows for the design of constructed-response questions. Socrative can be accessed by students and teachers via any Internet browser using any mobile device. Most of our students carried a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to class. Students without devices were encouraged to work with classmates to come up with answers for submission. Internet access was provided through the universityâs Wi-Fi system.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To use Socrative, the teacher signs up for a free account and is assigned a classroom number. In this virtual classroom, the teacher can design and save quizzes comprising different types of questions before or during the lessons. The quizzes can be started via the website any time during a lecture. Once the quiz is started, students can enter the classroom number on the Socrative website to access the quiz questions. Students key their answers into the space provided beneath each question and their submitted answers per quiz are collated by Socrative. The answers can be projected in class for everyone to read. As student responses were anonymous, they answered freely. The free Google Forms is another good alternative (data not shown).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Constructed-response questions and studentsâ responses</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">I converted clicker MCQs used in last yearâs teaching slides (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 1A</a>) to constructed-response questions by removing the cues provided (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 1B</a>). Interestingly, studentsâ constructed answers (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 1C</a>) shared similarities with the cues provided previously for the questions (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 1A</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This approach further allowed me to see a range of studentsâ answers that I would not have seen using MCQs. These answers opened up discussions on various issues during and after classes. For issues directly relevant to my lectures, I responded in class to clarify studentsâ ideas and understanding. The answers also revealed unexpected misconceptions that I immediately discussed with students (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 2</a>). As students submitted answers on a voluntary basis, the number of respondents was inconsistent throughout the module. Nonetheless, the answers from a segment of students were sufficient for others to view the different thoughts and ideas of their classmates.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>After-class feedback on studentsâ answers</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">After each quiz, Excel reports containing the questions and studentsâ answers could be downloaded. After class, I included further written comments in the Excel files on issues on which I lacked time to elaborate during lectures (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 2</a>). The edited reports were then uploaded onto our Integrated Virtual Learning Environment (IVLE) for students. I could therefore provide formative feedback on a range of typical answers fairly easily. The Excel files were also convenient for providing additional explanations on interesting answers that went beyond the scope of my lectures for students wishing to learn about topics outside the planned curriculum.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Of the 63 students (21%) who responded to the end-of-semester survey, most of them viewed the approach favorably (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 3</a>). Notably, they found reading other classmatesâ answers useful for learning from one another (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 3B</a>). Although only half the respondents had prior experience with clickers, there was no statistically significant difference between these students and those who had not used clickers before (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 4A</a>) in terms of difficulty in answering the short-response questions, indicating that there were no barriers to using such questions. Of the respondents with no prior experience with clickers, 71% indicated constructing answers on their own was useful, compared with 53% of those who had, although this was not statistically different (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 4B</a>). Crucially, the respondents regarded receiving feedback in class to written answers as important (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 4C</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While this approach has advantages (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 5</a>), the respondents also raised concerns including insufficient time to upload their answers (<a href=""#SD1"">Appendix 6</a>). This was sometimes due to Wi-Fi connectivity problems leading to a lag time in receiving studentsâ responses. Such problems can be overcome with better management of time on my part and preparation on the use of an online response system on the studentsâ part.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Incorporating constructed-response questions in class with feedback could support active-learning (<a href=""#b1-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b1-jmbe-16-87"">1</a>, <a href=""#b11-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b11-jmbe-16-87"">11</a>), which is known to be more beneficial than the passive learning of traditional lectures (<a href=""#b2-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b2-jmbe-16-87"">2</a>). Providing students with opportunities to compose their own answers is critical, given the links between writing and learning (<a href=""#b5-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b5-jmbe-16-87"">5</a>, <a href=""#b7-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b7-jmbe-16-87"">7</a>), as students move from âknowledge-tellingâ to âknowledge-transformationâ (<a href=""#b13-jmbe-16-87"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""b13-jmbe-16-87"">13</a>) by constructing answers. Constructed-response questions could be used during lectures to promote scientific writing and stimulate studentsâ thinking, and the format can be incorporated in large-class lectures.</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The treatment of diseases caused by nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM), including the fast-growing bacterium <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium abscessus</span>, is problematic because of low permeability of the cell wall, biofilm formation, deficient drug-activating enzymes, numerous enzymes that neutralize drugs or modify their specific targets, naturally occurring polymorphism, and induction of drug efflux pumps (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Such pumps use either ATP- or proton-motive force-driven energy forms generated by the electron transport chain (ETC), which generates the proton-motive force for condensing ADP plus P<sub>i</sub> to form ATP in the process of oxidative phosphorylation by the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Oxidative phosphorylation is the major process for ATP synthesis in the pathogen, making the enzymes of the ETC and the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase attractive as drug targets, as shown for clofazimine (CFZ), affecting NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) of the ETC (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>), or the repurposed antituberculosis (TB) drug bedaquiline (BDQ) and its derivative, TBAJ876, targeting <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>âs F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). However, despite being potent growth inhibitors, these compounds are mostly bacteriostatic against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The mycobacterial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase consists of its proton translocation F<sub>0</sub> sector (<i>a</i>:<i>c<sub>9</sub></i>), which is connected by the central, rotating Î³:Îµ and the peripheral stalk subunits <i>b</i>:<i>bâ²</i>:<i>Î´</i> to the catalytic Î±<sub>3</sub>:Î²<sub>3</sub> sector, in which ATP is formed (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">â</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). In contrast to nonmycobacterial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase, the mycobacterial F-ATP synthase subunits Î±, Î´, and Î³ contain a C-terminal elongation (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>), inserted domain (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), or an extra loop of 12 to 14 amino acids (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>), respectively. These add-ons are essential for regulation (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">â</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>) or ATP synthesis (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). For example, the mycobacterial extra loop of subunit Î³ provides a failsafe device (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>) by which one of its aspartate residues forms a salt bridge with an arginine residue of the peripheral stalk subunit <i>bâ²</i> during rotation, when subunit Î³ comes into proximity of subunit <i>bâ²</i> (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). These novel mycobacterial features of subunits Î± and Î³ are targets for specific and novel inhibitors (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). GaMF1, a bactericidal anti-TB compound that targets the extra loop of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> Î³ subunit, represents such a novel mycobacterial F-ATP synthase inhibitor, which has a clog<i>P</i> of 4.37 and good metabolic stability in mouse liver microsomes and does not inhibit growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria like <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we have used a repurposing approach for the GaMF1 anti-TB compound (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1A</a>) and studied <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>âs susceptibility to the compound in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (CAMH) medium (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>) and in complete Middlebrook 7H9 broth (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) using the type strain <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> subsp. <i>abscessus</i> ATCC 19977 as the test organism. GaMF1 displayed potency with a MIC required to inhibit the growth of 50% of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> (MIC<sub>50</sub>) of 13âÂ±â2.1âÎ¼M (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1B</a>) and 33âÂ±â4.7âÎ¼M (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). These values are comparable to the ones determined for GaMF1 in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> (33âÎ¼M) and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. bovis</span> Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) (17âÎ¼M) (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), and are in the range of the clinically used anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> drugs cefoxitin (38âÎ¼M [<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>]), amikacin (55âÎ¼M [<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>]), and imipenem (14âÎ¼M [<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>]). While the F-ATP synthase inhibitors BDQ and TBAJ876 reveal a 100Ã higher potency against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span> than <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), GaMF1 retains similar efficacy in cell growth inhibition and killing over a wide spectrum of mycobacteria.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F1"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Next, we determined whether GaMF1 susceptibility is retained against the clinical isolate <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> subsp. <i>abscessus</i> Bamboo (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The MIC<sub>50</sub> determined in CAMH medium and Middlebrook 7H9 broth was 10âÂ±â1.9âÎ¼M (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1C</a>) and 33âÂ±â3.2âÎ¼M (Fig. S1B), respectively, similar to the values determined for the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> type strain <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> subsp. <i>abscessus</i> ATCC 19977.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine whether GaMF1 is bactericidal against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>, we measured the survival of the type strain upon drug exposure. GaMF1 was bactericidal against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> at 10-fold its MIC<sub>50</sub> in both CAMH medium (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1D</a>) and 7H9 (Fig. S1C).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The ability of GaMF1 to inhibit mycobacterial F-ATP synthase was evaluated using an intracellular ATP synthesis assay (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>) and inside-out membrane vesicles (IMVs) of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), which were prepared according to Hotra et al. (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). As displayed in <a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2A</a>, compound GaMF1 depleted ATP synthesis within the cell with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 10âÂ±â0.9âÎ¼M and depleted NADH-driven ATP synthesis of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> IMVs with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 13âÂ±â2.5âÎ¼M (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2B</a>), suggesting that growth inhibition of the pathogen is caused by the inhibition of the F-ATP synthase.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F2"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Since treatment of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> infections requires drug combinations, we measured the growth inhibition activity of GaMF1 combined with CFZ, proposed to compete with the mycobacterial specific electron acceptor menaquinone for its reduction by the NDH-2 complex (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). CFZ has been recently shown to be active against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> and is used clinically as a repurposed drug (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a><a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24 B25"">â</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). As revealed in <a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>, the combination of 3 Î¼M CFZ or 6.8âÎ¼M (MIC<sub>50</sub> of CFZ [<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>]) with GaMF1 increased the potency of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> cell inhibition in 7H9 medium (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3A</a>). When GaMF1 was combined with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>âs RNA polymerase inhibitor rifabutin (MIC of 1 to 4âÎ¼M) (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3B</a>) or the anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> antibiotic amikacin (5âÎ¼M) (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3C</a>) (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>), a drastic reduction of cell growth was observed.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Considering the increased anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> activity in the GaMF1-rifabutin combination and rifabutinâs bactericidal activity (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>), the combinatory GaMF1-rifabution effect in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> killing was shown to be only marginal (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F4"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, this study has shown that GaMF1 is active in cell growth inhibition and killing of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span>, similar to the compoundâs activity against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</span>. The identification of GaMF1 as a novel <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. abscessus</span> inhibitor expands the poorly populated compound pipeline against this difficult-to-cure opportunistic NTM pathogen.

The predicted functions indicated that some key carbohydrate metabolism pathways related to lactic acid synthesis were downregulated, while some competing pathways (ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism) were upregulated in M silage compared to AM silage after 3Â days of fermentation. Correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between competing pathways and enterobacterial species.

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Silage making is a worldwide practice that uses the natural fermentation carried out by epiphytic microbiota, permitting forage crops to be stored for extended periods. The production of silage is important for agricultural and industrial value chains. It provides not only conserved forage for livestock but also substrates for bioenergy production. In many European countries, silage production accounts for a large share of the feed and substrate supply (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The biochemistry of silage fermentation is essentially a simple process, but the interaction of microbial and chemical compositions can result in a high degree of variability in fermentation quality. Nevertheless, regardless of the silage production purpose, quality fermentation is essential for the preservation of biomass and its subsequent use.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The quality of fermentation is largely dependent on the epiphytic microbiota naturally present on forage (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Unlike grain production, the biomass used for silage production is the above-ground part of the plant. It is exposed to the atmosphere and subjected to the diurnal cycle. The populations of many epiphytic microorganisms undergo pronounced changes throughout the day as a consequence of direct impact by environmental fluctuations and indirect influence by plant metabolism (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). It is well established that this turnover rhythm of epiphytic microbiota results in significant changes in composition and function (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). However, possible effects brought by these diurnal changes on silage fermentation are rarely explored, likely because those effects are difficult to differentiate from the effects brought by chemical changes. Recently, silage researchers started to use microbiota transplantation to clarify the role of exogenous epiphytic microbiota in silage quality (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). They demonstrated that exogenous microbiota can reconstruct a similar function in the recipient plant. Moreover, gamma ray radiation is popular in silage research since it can sterilize forage without significantly altering plant chemical compositions and enzyme activities (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). The development of these techniques offers the opportunity to evaluate the effects of exogenous microbiota on silage fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Growing multipurpose sweet sorghum is gaining popularity, especially in regions that experience drought, delayed planting, and high summer temperatures that limit corn production (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (SSG; <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sorghum bicolor</span> L.Ã <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sorghum sudanense</span> L.) is the most commonly used sorghum type because of its flexible planting time, rapid growth, high yields, and suitability in rotation systems (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). In this study, SSG was selected as the model crop considering its essential role in food, feed, fodder, and fuel security in dryland agriculture. To evaluate the effects of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on SSG silage fermentation, we transplanted epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvested at various times within a day to sterilized SSG. We hypothesized that SSG epiphytic microbiota exhibited variations in composition and function during the daytime and that these changes would affect the fermentation characteristics of SSG. Our study will elucidate the role of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation and advance our ability to produce high-quality silage.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Forage characteristics and microbial counts of epiphytic microbiota.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Gamma ray irradiation was used to obtain sterile SSG. As shown by the results in <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>, for fresh SSG, the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents and buffering capacity (BC) were 208 g/kg fresh weight (FW), 51.3 g/kg DM, 106 g/kg DM, 636 g/kg DM, 411 g/kg DM, and 75.3 meq/kg DM, respectively. The counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> of fresh SSG were 2.52, 8.08, 6.70, and 7.60 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g FW, respectively. After gamma ray irradiation, no viable microorganisms were detected, suggesting that SSG was entirely sterilized by the gamma ray irradiation. The microbial counts of epiphytic microbiota inoculums prepared from forage harvested at various times of day are presented in <a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>. The M and PM microbiota had lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) LAB and yeast counts than the AM microbiota. The aerobic bacterial counts were lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) in PM microbiota than in AM and M microbiota. The <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> counts were greatest in the M microbiota.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The fermentation characteristics of SSG inoculated with epiphytic microbiota from forage harvested at various times of day are given in <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>. The largest declines of pH and greatest increases of lactic acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratios were observed during the initial 7Â days of fermentation. Marked differences in fermentation characteristics were observed among the three silages during this period. As for pH and lactic acid, AM silage exhibited the most rapid pH declines and lactic acid production, followed by PM silage and then M silage. The acetic acid contents were highest in AM silage during the initial 14Â days, whereas PM silage had the highest acetic acid contents after 30Â days of fermentation. It is worth noting that M silage had the lowest lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio during the initial 7Â days, while it had the highest lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio after 14Â days of fermentation. The propionic acid and butyric acid contents were all detected in trace amounts. The ethanol contents of SSG silages were all lower than 30 g/kg DM, and the DM contents changed little during the fermentation (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2E</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">F</a>). There were no differences in ethanol and DM contents among the silages. Consistent with the increases in lactic acid contents, the WSC contents were observed to decline rapidly during the initial 7Â days of fermentation. The rates of decline varied among the silages, with the fastest in AM silage, the moderate rate in PM silage, and the slowest in M silage. The NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents peaked between day 3 and day 7 of fermentation and then declined at the late stages of fermentation. All silages contained NH<sub>3</sub>-N at &lt;100 g/kg of total nitrogen (TN), and lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents were observed in M silage than in AM silage during the initial 7Â days of fermentation.</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The microbial counts of SSG inoculated with epiphytic microbiota from forage harvested at various times of day during fermentation are given in <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>. Marked differences in microbial counts were observed among the three silages during fermentation. In all silages, the LAB counts quickly exceeded 7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g FW after 1Â day, peaked between days 3 and 7, and then declined after 7Â days of fermentation. The M and PM silages had greater (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) LAB counts than AM silage at day 30, and M silage had greater LAB counts at day 60 of fermentation. As for other microorganisms, there were overall tendencies for them to decrease in the populations during fermentation, but their rates of decrease varied depending on the silage. For AM silage, microorganisms including aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeasts immediately dropped to below the detection level after the onset of fermentation. In contrast, these microorganisms remained present in large count numbers in the other silages, especially the M silage, for longer periods of time.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Bacterial diversity and composition during SSG fermentation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To reveal the effects of the epiphytic microbiota on the bacterial community and diversity, fermentation was monitored in epiphytic microbiota and silages at days 1, 3, and 60 of fermentation, considering that these time points may better reflect the different stages of fermentation. After quality control, a total of 1,227,751 high-quality reads were obtained in all samples. The average length of the reads was 428âbp. Based on a 97% sequence identity threshold, these reads were clustered into 1,096 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with 848 species and 540 genera.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bacterial diversity was quantified by means of two metrics, Î±-diversity and Î²-diversity (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). The M silage had higher (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) Shannon index values at days 1 and 3 of fermentation, suggesting greater Î±-diversity in M silage than in other silages at the early stages of fermentation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>). To characterize the divergent communities, Î²-diversity was determined by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a> to <a href=""#fig3"">F</a>). The PCoA showed that epiphytic microbiota from various times were clearly separated from each other by two axes (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>) (analysis of similarity [ANOSIM], <i>R</i>â=â0.992, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.001), suggesting a high degree of dissimilarity of epiphytic microbiota compositions. Anaerobic fermentation significantly altered the bacterial communities (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>) (ANOSIM, <i>R</i>â=â0.707, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001). According to the Î²-diversity at each fermentation time, epiphytic microbiota significantly affected the bacterial community compositions during the initial 3Â days of fermentation (ANOSIM, day 1, <i>R</i>â=â0.465, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001, and day 3, <i>R</i>â=â0.934, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3D</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">E</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Tax4fun2 was used to predict the metagenomics functional composition, based on 16S rRNA marker genes. The predicted sequences mainly belonged to metabolism (69.9% to 76.5%), environmental information processing (9.71% to 13.8%), genetic information processing (2.96% to 6.57%), and cellular processes (3.73% to 8.93%) categories (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a>). In the metabolism category at KEGG level 2, three subfunctions, namely, carbohydrate metabolism (8.58% to 13.9%), membrane transport (5.74% to 10.7%), and amino acid metabolism (5.76% to 7.85%), showed the highest abundances compared to the abundances of other subfunctions. The functional shifts of bacterial communities during SSG fermentation are shown in <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>. There were remarkable differences in the functional profiles of epiphytic microbiota from various times. The AM microbiota had more abundant metabolism categories, such as lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. The M and PM microbiota had more abundant cell community and cell motility. In addition, cell growth and death, transport and catabolism, and signal molecules and interaction were more abundant in PM epiphytic microbiota. During fermentation, marked upregulations of carbohydrate metabolism were observed after 1Â day of fermentation, and the extents of upregulation were distinct among the silages and followed the order AM &gt; PM &gt; M. To investigate the metabolic pathways leading to the differences in carbohydrate metabolism, pathways for processing carbohydrates were further explored at KEGG level 3 (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7C</a>). Most of the significant pathway differences were observed at day 3 of fermentation. In total, five and three pathways were significantly downregulated in M and PM silages, respectively, compared to AM silage. The most notably downregulated pathways in M silage were starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism and in PM silage were fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism. Additionally, three pathways, including ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, were significantly upregulated in M silage compared to AM silage.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The current study explored the influences of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on the fermentation characteristics of SSG through gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation. In the present study, gamma ray irradiation at a sufficient dose entirely sterilized the forage, which provided an ideal condition for studying the effects of exogenous microbiota inoculation on silage fermentation characteristics. The WSC content of the raw material is another important factor in silage fermentation (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). In line with our previous study, the WSC content of SSG in the present study satisfied the requirement (&gt;60 g/kg DM) for quality fermentation (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). It suggested the benefit of using SSG as the plant material in silage production.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The epiphytic microbiota, the microorganisms naturally present on the surface of plants, is responsible for silage fermentation (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). However, the aerial parts of plants form a highly diverse and dynamic environment where epiphytes need to cope with UV radiation exposure, low water and nutrient availability, and high temperature fluctuations throughout the day (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). Epiphytic microbiota compositions exhibit considerable variations in diurnal and temporal patterns (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). The epiphytic microorganisms of greatest concern in fermentation are LAB, enterobacteria, aerobic bacteria, and yeasts. Because silage is preserved by lactic acid fermentation, only epiphytic LAB are beneficial; others are considered undesirable, causing either fermentation failure or silage deterioration. The present results showed that epiphytic LAB counts decreased significantly in M and PM microbiota compared to the counts in AM microbiota. This was not surprising, since LAB lack many of the microbial traits that are found in phyllosphere-adapted bacteria. For example, many phyllosphere bacteria are pigmented and use these pigments to protect against high levels of UV radiation on leaf surfaces (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Similarly, Li et al. (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>) reported that 8Â h of UV exposure significantly decreased the LAB counts on Siberian wildrye. The yeast count also decreased during the day, suggesting their high sensitivity to the dynamic diurnal environment. However, this was inconsistent with our previous observation in Napier grass, where the yeast counts did not change significantly (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The discrepancy could be associated with the differences in leaf physical structures and nutrient conditions between the two forage crops (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). The M microbiota had the highest <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> counts, which was consistent with the enrichment of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span>. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. Unlike LAB, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> are yellow pigmented, motile, and grow in mucoid-forming colonies. These traits make them successful inhabitants in the phyllosphere (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). The dominance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> in M microbiota suggested that the harsh environment during the day may have an effect of enriching stress-resistant species in the phyllosphere.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Silage fermentation depends on epiphytic LAB converting WSC to organic acids, mainly lactic acid, along with reduction of the pH. It is generally accepted that at least 5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g LAB is required for adequate fermentation (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). Therefore, the differences in the epiphytic LAB populations may explain the varying rates of pH declines and organic acid production among the silages during fermentation. However, this could not explain the fermentation differences between M and PM silages, considering the comparable epiphytic LAB counts. One explanation could be the high enterobacterial number in M microbiota compared to the number in PM microbiota. Enterobacteria are principal competitors of LAB for available sugars during fermentation (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). The diurnally enriched enterobacteria may increase their competition with LAB, restrain LAB development, and further retard the fermentation. Likewise, Ãstling and Lindgren (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) have reported that inoculating a crop with enterobacteria resulted in temporarily retarded rates of lactic acid and acetic acid production. The acetic acid contents were observed to be highest in PM silage after 30Â days of fermentation, suggesting a greater activity of acetic acid-producing bacteria, such as heterolactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio is an indicator of the extent of homofermentation in relation to heterofermentation during fermentation (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). In the present study, all SSG silages had a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of &gt;2.0, suggesting the predominance of homofermentation during SSG fermentation. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio was higher in M silage after 14Â days of fermentation, suggesting stronger homofermentation than in the other silages.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Ethanol has little preservation effect and its production is associated with extremely high DM and energy losses in silage. More than 30 to 40 g/kg DM of ethanol production in silage is mainly associated with the action of yeasts (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In the present study, all SSG silages had ethanol contents of &lt;30 g/kg DM, suggesting that ethanol was mainly produced by microbes like heterolactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria. The NH<sub>3</sub>-N content is an indicator of the extent of protein breakdown in silage (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents of all silages were within the acceptable ranges of NH<sub>3</sub>-N (&lt;100 g/kg of TN), suggesting that SSG protein was well preserved during fermentation. Generally, NH<sub>3</sub>-N would accumulate continuously during fermentation. However, our results indicated that NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents decreased at the late stages of fermentation. A similar phenomenon has been reported by Ogunade et al. (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). In that study, they ascribed it to the oxidization of NH<sub>3</sub>-N under low dissolved oxygen conditions by some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Acidification by organic acids produced during fermentation is the main means of controlling the growth of undesirable microorganisms in silage. Therefore, it is not surprising that the populations of undesirable microorganisms, including aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeasts, showed overall tendencies to decrease during fermentation. The undesirable microorganisms remained in large counts in M silage for longer periods of time, which could be due to its slowest pH decline and organic acid production during fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Generally, diverse bacterial communities in crops are formed in the field and LAB development will simplify the bacterial community and result in a decline in alpha diversity during fermentation (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). Alpha diversity was low during the early stages of SSG fermentation and increased at the late stages of fermentation. This could be closely related to the changes in the LAB population; LAB multiplied extensively during the early stages of fermentation, reached the maximum number through 3 to 7âdays of fermentation, and then kept decreasing in the later fermentation period. The M silage had higher alpha diversity than the other silages during the initial 3Â days of fermentation. This was possibly due to its having the slowest pH decline, which did not effectively inhibit the undesirable microorganisms (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). According to the PCoA results, the bacterial community compositions at days 1 and 3 of fermentation were clearly separated by different inoculation groups. This suggested that the diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota significantly affected the bacterial community successions during the early stages of SSG fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The competition between LAB and undesirable microorganisms takes place during fermentation, and an anaerobic fermentation dominated by LAB is the key to producing a well-preserved silage (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span> were the first dominant LAB genera during SSG fermentation. These LAB species are the most isolated from standing plants, carrying out mixed acid fermentation and contributing to the initial pH decline during fermentation (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> was identified as the indicator LAB in AM silage, whereas <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span> was the indicator LAB in M silage at day 1 of fermentation. It suggested that the varying rates of acidification may result in the establishment of different niches that are favorable for different LAB species (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, more-acid-tolerant <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus</span> began to dominate the fermentation, along with the decreases in the relative abundances of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span>. The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus</span> bacteria mainly consisted of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span>, which is the most frequent LAB species in anaerobic plant matter, as well as in many fermented food products (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> generally contributes to the substantial lactic acid accumulation and desirable fermentation properties in silage because of its acid-resistant nature and superior ability to utilize a wide variety of substrates. The fastest dominance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> was consistent with the most rapid and intense lactic acid fermentation in AM silage. The relative abundance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus parabuchneri</span> was greater in PM silage after 60Â days of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus parabuchneri</span> is a heterofermentative LAB species producing acetic acid as its main product, and in addition, it can convert lactic acid into acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol in silage (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). These facts may partly explain the highest acetic acid contents in PM silage after 30Â days of fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Enterobacteria were the primary undesirable bacteria that showed differences in abundance in epiphytic microbiota and silages among different inoculation groups. The dominant enterobacteria in the epiphytic microbiota were mainly <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> species, whereas they were rapidly replaced by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> after the beginning of fermentation. This was consistent with the report of Li and Nishino (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>) that the enterobacteria found on fresh grass would be replaced by enterobacterial species, which adapt better to the silage environment. After 3Â days of fermentation, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> was again detected in large abundance, suggesting that some members of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> genus could survive the anaerobic, acid environment. Similarly, Liang et al. (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>) reported that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> bacteria were detected apparently at early and late stages of <i>paocai</i> fermentation. Among the silages, enterobacteria, including <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span>, were specifically enriched in M silage at the early stages of fermentation. It is generally accepted that a rapid pH decline is the key to controlling enterobacteria in silage (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). Their prosperity could be due to the retarded fermentation that allowed them to persist longer in the silage. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> is a common genus during natural fermentation of various forage crops (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). A higher relative abundance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> could enhance the ammonia and biogenic amine production by deaminating and decarboxylating amino acids in silages (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span> species can destabilize silage aerobic stability, and some species are opportunistic pathogens that can cause mastitis in animals (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). The role of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> species in silage fermentation is less known. However, researchers consider that they have a role similar to that of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> species, competing with LAB for available sugars during fermentation (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbial communities are shaped by interactions among the populations that affect the community dynamics and function (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). The exploration of cooccurrence networks offered new insight into the structure of complex microbial communities. The results demonstrated that the complexity of the bacterial networks decreased in M and PM silages compared to the bacterial network in AM silage. Hernandez et al. (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>) pointed out that the complexity of microbial networks would decrease along with the stress gradient. These results suggested that the stressful environment during the day may have acted as a strong filtering factor against the existing epiphytic bacterial species and affected the species cooccurrence patterns during fermentation. Butler and OâDwyer (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>) suggested that positive pairwise interactions can push communities closer to instability. The stressed bacterial communities had lower ratios of negative/positive interactions during fermentation, suggesting the lower stability of communities. The lower ratios of negative/positive interactions in the cooccurrence networks could be due to some âcompetitiveâ taxa that engaged in antagonistic interspecific interactions during fermentation being replaced by stress-tolerant species (e.g., oligotrophic microbes). For example, some OTUs affiliated with LAB species, such as <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactococcus</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span>, were replaced by bacterial species like <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span> or members of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Methylobacterium</span><i>-</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Methylorubrum</span> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In accordance with our previous study, carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and amino acid metabolism are the main metabolic pathways involved in silage fermentation (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). The epiphytic microbiota from various times had remarkably different functional profiles, suggesting their different metabolic potentials. The M and PM microbiota had more abundant cell community and greater cell motility than the AM microbiota. The increased abundances of these pathways could be associated with the enrichment of stress-resistant bacteria in SSG during the day. Different epiphytic microbiota induced various extents of upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism during fermentation, reflecting their different capacities in metabolizing WSC. Some carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly downregulated in M and PM silages compared to their regulation in AM silage after 3Â days of fermentation. These results suggested that the loss of function of the bacterial communities in metabolizing some types of carbohydrates contributed greatly to delayed fermentation in the silages. Notably, among the downregulated pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism were especially downregulated in M silage. Starch and sucrose are the major storage forms of carbohydrate in sorghum (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), and pyruvate is the precursor for the generation of organic acids like lactic acid, Î±-acetolactate, acetic acid, and formic acid (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). The downregulation of metabolism pathways related to those key carbohydrates and metabolites may strongly limit lactic acid fermentation, possibly explaining why fermentation was retarded to the greatest extent in M silage. Apart from the downregulated pathways, some carbohydrate metabolism pathways were observed to be upregulated in M silage compared to AM silage. These included ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. Yin et al. (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>) reported that metabolism of ascorbate and aldarate and C5-branched dibasic acid would consume large amounts of sugars. They suggested that the presence of these pathways would compete for the available sugars and shift the carbon flux away from lactic acid synthesis.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The flourishing of enterobacteria would deplete carbohydrate reserves and result in the failure of LAB to dominate fermentation (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, enterobacterial species were positively correlated with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. This confirmed that they were the main substrate competitors of LAB during the fermentation. Among the enterobacterial species, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span> was also positively correlated with the competing pathways, suggesting that diurnally enriched <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> bacteria could increase the competitive pressure on LAB during fermentation. Enterobacterial species are sensitive to pH declines (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Therefore, they were positively correlated with pH and negatively correlated with lactic acid. Besides lactic acid, acetic acid also showed negative correlations with the enterobacterial species at day 1 of fermentation. Acetic acid is known to retard enterobacterial growth in silage (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Negative correlations between acetic acid and enterobacterial species suggested its important role in inhibiting enterobacterial growth at the initial stage of fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">After 1Â day of fermentation, acetic acid and lactic acid were positively correlated with <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactococcus</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span>. Moreover, these LAB species also showed positive correlations with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism. These results suggested that they played key roles in the production of organic acids and the control of enterobacteria at the initial stages of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> contains a comprehensive carbohydrate utilization system composed of plentiful sugar uptake- and metabolism-related genes that endow it with its strong carbohydrate utilization ability (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> were positively correlated with acetic acid, lactic acid, the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio, and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathways. This confirmed the key role of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> in extensive carbohydrate metabolism and the production of organic acids during the fermentation process. After 60Â days of fermentation, the few correlations between bacterial species and fermentation characteristics indicate the decreasing effect of bacterial community on fermentation at the late stages. However, it was observed that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> was positively correlated with acetic acid after 60Â days of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> possesses a complete set of genes for acetate catabolism via the glyoxylate cycle pathway (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). The positive correlation suggested that high acetic acid content may favor the survival and growth of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> in SSG silage. Aeromonads preferentially use ammonium as their nitrogen source (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Chitinophaga</span> bacteria were identified as the nitrifiers in activated sludge under low dissolved oxygen conditions (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). Negative correlations of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aeromonas hydrophila</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Chitinophaga</span> with NH<sub>3</sub>-N suggested that these bacteria may be responsible for the decreased NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents at the late stages of fermentation.</div>
<section id=""sec-3-1"" data-type=""conclusions""><h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation offered the opportunity to evaluate the effects of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on silage fermentation. The results showed that the epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvested at various times of the day varied greatly in composition and function. The diurnal variation affected the competition between LAB and enterobacteria, leading to increased proportions of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc lactis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella variicola</span>, whereas the proportions of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella cibaria</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> in M silage decreased during fermentation compared to their proportions in AM silage. Marked differences in fermentation characteristics were observed among the silages during the initial 7Â days of fermentation, with the fastest pH declines and organic acid production in AM silage and the slowest in M silage. Both M and PM silages exhibited decreases in the complexity and stability of bacterial networks compared to those in AM silage during the fermentation. Our study reveals the importance of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation, which provides clues for technological parameter optimization for the fermentation process.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-4-1""><h3>Experimental material and inoculum preparation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (SSG; Sumu no. 03) was grown at Nanjing Agricultural University (32Â°01â²19â³N, 118Â°51â²08â³E, 25 m above sea level), Nanjing, China. The SSG was planted on 23 April 2021 in nine experimental plots (8 m by 5 m each), and all plots had the same tillage, irrigation, and fertilization practices. After 12 weeks of growth, these plots of SSG were randomly assigned to three harvest times (7.00Â h [AM], 12.00Â h [M], and 17.00Â h [PM]). Thus, this study had three sources of forage: AM-, M-, and PM-harvested SSG. At each harvest time, the temperature and relative humidity were measured with a temperature and humidity recorder (UT331; Youlide Instruments Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou, China), and the solar radiation intensity was recorded with a portable pyranometer (Metravi 207; Metravi Instruments Pvt. Ltd, West Bengal, India). The temperatures at the AM, M, and PM times were 26.9, 29.2, and 25.5Â°C, the relative humidity levels were 93.8, 86.1, and 95.2%, and the solar radiation intensities were 95.2, 312, and 152 W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The harvested SSG was chopped into lengths of ~1 to 2âcm for inoculum preparations. The inoculum of microbiota was prepared according to the method of Mogodiniyai Kasmaei et al. (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), with modifications. Briefly, a volume of 1,200âmL of Ringer solution fortified with Tween 80 at 0.5âmL/L was mixed with 333 g of SSG. The mixture was then kept in the orbital shaker at 120ârpm for 60âmin and filtered with four layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 15,500Â ÃÂ <i>g</i> for 10âmin. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 3âmL quarter-strength Ringer solution. Additionally, another batch of SSG was harvested, chopped (~1 to 2âcm), and used for silage preparation. Amounts of about 300 g of SSG were vacuum packaged into polyethylene plastic bags (30 by 40âcm). In total, 54 samples (3 inoculumsâÃâ6 storage periodsâÃâ3 replicates) were prepared and irradiated with gamma radiation at 32 kGy over 2Â h using a <sup>60</sup>Co source (Nanjing Xiyue Irradiation Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The irradiated bags were opened in a laminar flow cabinet and inoculated with different sources of epiphytic microbiota (i.e., AM, M, and PM microbiota). According to the method of Mogodiniyai Kasmaei et al. (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), there were two assumptions for the inoculum: (i) the microbial population was removed entirely from the fresh forage and was evenly distributed in the liquid fraction, and (ii) the recovery of the microbial population from centrifugation was 90%. Therefore, the eluted inoculum (3âmL) represented the whole epiphytic bacterial population from 300 g of fresh forage. After inoculation, the bags were resealed and stored at room temperature (20 to 25Â°C). The bags were opened after 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60âdays of fermentation for chemical and microbial analyses.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-2""><h3>Experimental analyses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The pre-ensiling forage and silages were thoroughly mixed before chemical analyses. Approximately 100-g samples were oven dried for 48Â h at 60Â°C for dry matter (DM) determination. After that, dried samples were ground with a laboratory pulverizer (FW100; Taisite Instrument Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) to pass through a 1-mm screen for total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) measurements according to the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The crude protein (CP) content was calculated by multiplying TN by 6.25. The DM contents were corrected with the losses of volatiles during oven drying using the equations of Gallo et al. (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine the ensiling traits of fresh material and fermentation parameters of silage, ~20-g samples were blended with 180âmL distilled water and macerated for 24Â h at 4Â°C. The extracts were filtered through 2 layers of cheesecloth and a filter paper. The pH was measured with a Hanna HI 2221 pH meter (Hanna Instruments Italia Srl, Villafranca Padovana, Italy). The buffering capacity of fresh material and ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N) content of silage were determined using the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The organic acids (including lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) and ethanol were quantified using an Agilent 1260 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a refractive index detector (Carbomix H-NP5 column, 2.5âmM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5âmL/min).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For microbial population analyses, 10-g samples were thoroughly blended with 90âmL of sterilized saline solution on a shaker at 120ârpm for 90âmin. One hundred microliters of the blended liquid was serially diluted with sterilized saline solution. The LAB, aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeast counts were determined according to the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). After that, the remaining blended liquid was filtered into a 50-mL centrifuge tube with 4 layers of cheesecloth. The blended liquid was centrifuged at 4Â°C for 15âmin at 10,000ârpm.

<div role=""paragraph"">The DNA extraction was conducted using the FastDNA spin kit and the FastPrep instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) according to the manufacturerâs protocols. The quantity and quality of the DNA obtained were determined using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). Universal primers 338F and 806R were used for the PCR amplification, with the target being the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The PCR products were purified using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA) and quantified using QuantiFluor-ST (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The DNA were paired-end sequenced (2âÃâ300âbp) on an Illumina MiSeq PE300 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Raw sequences were processed using FLASH (version 1.2.11). The QIIME (version 1.9.1) quality control process was used to discard low-quality sequences (quality scores of &lt;20). Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME (version 1.7.0). Only sequences at least 200âbp long after quality filtering were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level. The Î±-diversity estimators (Shannon, abundance-based coverage estimator [ACE], Chao1, and coverage indexes) were analyzed using QIIME (version 1.9.1). The Î²-diversity analysis, performed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), was used to visualize the variations in bacterial communities between samples using the UniFrac weighted-distance metric. The community structures of bacteria were analyzed at the genus and species levels using the Silva database (version 138) with a confidence threshold of 70%.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To identify the diurnal indicator bacteria, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) was performed with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score threshold of &gt;3.0. Stream graphs are used to show the bacterial community succession during fermentation (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The correlations (|Ï|Â &gt;Â 0.06, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) among bacterial OTUs were analyzed by Spearmanâs rank correlations. The OTUs with relative abundances of &gt;0.01% were retained to construct cooccurrence networks. To compare the network structures, individual cooccurrence networks (for AM, M, and PM silages) were created using Gephi (version 0.9.2). According to the graph theory of cooccurrence networks, the average path length, average clustering coefficient, modularity, average degree, and graph density were calculated using the â<i>igraph</i>â package of R (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>).

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Ensiling is a way to preserve wet biomass for animal and bioenergy production worldwide. The fermentation quality of silage is largely dependent on the epiphytic microbiota of the material. Plant epiphytic microbiota exhibit diurnal changes in composition and function. However, the effects of these changes on silage fermentation are rarely explored. The results presented here demonstrated that diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota could affect the fermentation characteristics and bacterial community during SSG fermentation. Marked bacterial community differences were observed between AM and M silages during the initial 3Â days of fermentation. The dominance rate of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> was highest in AM silage, whereas enterobacterial species were more abundant in M silage. The predicted function revealed downregulated lactic acid synthesis pathways and upregulated competing pathways in M silage compared to those in AM silage. This study provides clues for technological-parameter optimization of the fermentation process by the selection of harvest time.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Silage making is a worldwide practice that uses the natural fermentation carried out by epiphytic microbiota, permitting forage crops to be stored for extended periods. The production of silage is important for agricultural and industrial value chains. It provides not only conserved forage for livestock but also substrates for bioenergy production. In many European countries, silage production accounts for a large share of the feed and substrate supply (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The biochemistry of silage fermentation is essentially a simple process, but the interaction of microbial and chemical compositions can result in a high degree of variability in fermentation quality. Nevertheless, regardless of the silage production purpose, quality fermentation is essential for the preservation of biomass and its subsequent use.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The quality of fermentation is largely dependent on the epiphytic microbiota naturally present on forage (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Unlike grain production, the biomass used for silage production is the above-ground part of the plant. It is exposed to the atmosphere and subjected to the diurnal cycle. The populations of many epiphytic microorganisms undergo pronounced changes throughout the day as a consequence of direct impact by environmental fluctuations and indirect influence by plant metabolism (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). It is well established that this turnover rhythm of epiphytic microbiota results in significant changes in composition and function (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). However, possible effects brought by these diurnal changes on silage fermentation are rarely explored, likely because those effects are difficult to differentiate from the effects brought by chemical changes. Recently, silage researchers started to use microbiota transplantation to clarify the role of exogenous epiphytic microbiota in silage quality (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). They demonstrated that exogenous microbiota can reconstruct a similar function in the recipient plant. Moreover, gamma ray radiation is popular in silage research since it can sterilize forage without significantly altering plant chemical compositions and enzyme activities (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). The development of these techniques offers the opportunity to evaluate the effects of exogenous microbiota on silage fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Growing multipurpose sweet sorghum is gaining popularity, especially in regions that experience drought, delayed planting, and high summer temperatures that limit corn production (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (SSG; <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sorghum bicolor</span> L.Ã <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Sorghum sudanense</span> L.) is the most commonly used sorghum type because of its flexible planting time, rapid growth, high yields, and suitability in rotation systems (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). In this study, SSG was selected as the model crop considering its essential role in food, feed, fodder, and fuel security in dryland agriculture. To evaluate the effects of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on SSG silage fermentation, we transplanted epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvested at various times within a day to sterilized SSG. We hypothesized that SSG epiphytic microbiota exhibited variations in composition and function during the daytime and that these changes would affect the fermentation characteristics of SSG. Our study will elucidate the role of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation and advance our ability to produce high-quality silage.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Forage characteristics and microbial counts of epiphytic microbiota.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Gamma ray irradiation was used to obtain sterile SSG. As shown by the results in <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>, for fresh SSG, the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents and buffering capacity (BC) were 208 g/kg fresh weight (FW), 51.3 g/kg DM, 106 g/kg DM, 636 g/kg DM, 411 g/kg DM, and 75.3 meq/kg DM, respectively. The counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> of fresh SSG were 2.52, 8.08, 6.70, and 7.60 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g FW, respectively. After gamma ray irradiation, no viable microorganisms were detected, suggesting that SSG was entirely sterilized by the gamma ray irradiation. The microbial counts of epiphytic microbiota inoculums prepared from forage harvested at various times of day are presented in <a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>. The M and PM microbiota had lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) LAB and yeast counts than the AM microbiota. The aerobic bacterial counts were lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) in PM microbiota than in AM and M microbiota. The <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> counts were greatest in the M microbiota.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The fermentation characteristics of SSG inoculated with epiphytic microbiota from forage harvested at various times of day are given in <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>. The largest declines of pH and greatest increases of lactic acid, acetic acid, and lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratios were observed during the initial 7Â days of fermentation. Marked differences in fermentation characteristics were observed among the three silages during this period. As for pH and lactic acid, AM silage exhibited the most rapid pH declines and lactic acid production, followed by PM silage and then M silage. The acetic acid contents were highest in AM silage during the initial 14Â days, whereas PM silage had the highest acetic acid contents after 30Â days of fermentation. It is worth noting that M silage had the lowest lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio during the initial 7Â days, while it had the highest lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio after 14Â days of fermentation. The propionic acid and butyric acid contents were all detected in trace amounts. The ethanol contents of SSG silages were all lower than 30 g/kg DM, and the DM contents changed little during the fermentation (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2E</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">F</a>). There were no differences in ethanol and DM contents among the silages. Consistent with the increases in lactic acid contents, the WSC contents were observed to decline rapidly during the initial 7Â days of fermentation. The rates of decline varied among the silages, with the fastest in AM silage, the moderate rate in PM silage, and the slowest in M silage. The NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents peaked between day 3 and day 7 of fermentation and then declined at the late stages of fermentation. All silages contained NH<sub>3</sub>-N at &lt;100 g/kg of total nitrogen (TN), and lower (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents were observed in M silage than in AM silage during the initial 7Â days of fermentation.</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The microbial counts of SSG inoculated with epiphytic microbiota from forage harvested at various times of day during fermentation are given in <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>. Marked differences in microbial counts were observed among the three silages during fermentation. In all silages, the LAB counts quickly exceeded 7 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g FW after 1Â day, peaked between days 3 and 7, and then declined after 7Â days of fermentation. The M and PM silages had greater (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) LAB counts than AM silage at day 30, and M silage had greater LAB counts at day 60 of fermentation. As for other microorganisms, there were overall tendencies for them to decrease in the populations during fermentation, but their rates of decrease varied depending on the silage. For AM silage, microorganisms including aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeasts immediately dropped to below the detection level after the onset of fermentation. In contrast, these microorganisms remained present in large count numbers in the other silages, especially the M silage, for longer periods of time.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Bacterial diversity and composition during SSG fermentation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To reveal the effects of the epiphytic microbiota on the bacterial community and diversity, fermentation was monitored in epiphytic microbiota and silages at days 1, 3, and 60 of fermentation, considering that these time points may better reflect the different stages of fermentation. After quality control, a total of 1,227,751 high-quality reads were obtained in all samples. The average length of the reads was 428âbp. Based on a 97% sequence identity threshold, these reads were clustered into 1,096 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with 848 species and 540 genera.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bacterial diversity was quantified by means of two metrics, Î±-diversity and Î²-diversity (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). The M silage had higher (<i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) Shannon index values at days 1 and 3 of fermentation, suggesting greater Î±-diversity in M silage than in other silages at the early stages of fermentation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>). To characterize the divergent communities, Î²-diversity was determined by principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a> to <a href=""#fig3"">F</a>). The PCoA showed that epiphytic microbiota from various times were clearly separated from each other by two axes (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>) (analysis of similarity [ANOSIM], <i>R</i>â=â0.992, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.001), suggesting a high degree of dissimilarity of epiphytic microbiota compositions. Anaerobic fermentation significantly altered the bacterial communities (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>) (ANOSIM, <i>R</i>â=â0.707, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001). According to the Î²-diversity at each fermentation time, epiphytic microbiota significantly affected the bacterial community compositions during the initial 3Â days of fermentation (ANOSIM, day 1, <i>R</i>â=â0.465, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001, and day 3, <i>R</i>â=â0.934, <i>Pâ=â</i>0.001) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3D</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">E</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The bacterial community compositions at the genus and species levels during SSG fermentation are displayed in <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a> and <a href=""#fig4"">B</a>.

<div role=""paragraph"">Tax4fun2 was used to predict the metagenomics functional composition, based on 16S rRNA marker genes. The predicted sequences mainly belonged to metabolism (69.9% to 76.5%), environmental information processing (9.71% to 13.8%), genetic information processing (2.96% to 6.57%), and cellular processes (3.73% to 8.93%) categories (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a>). In the metabolism category at KEGG level 2, three subfunctions, namely, carbohydrate metabolism (8.58% to 13.9%), membrane transport (5.74% to 10.7%), and amino acid metabolism (5.76% to 7.85%), showed the highest abundances compared to the abundances of other subfunctions. The functional shifts of bacterial communities during SSG fermentation are shown in <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>. There were remarkable differences in the functional profiles of epiphytic microbiota from various times. The AM microbiota had more abundant metabolism categories, such as lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. The M and PM microbiota had more abundant cell community and cell motility. In addition, cell growth and death, transport and catabolism, and signal molecules and interaction were more abundant in PM epiphytic microbiota. During fermentation, marked upregulations of carbohydrate metabolism were observed after 1Â day of fermentation, and the extents of upregulation were distinct among the silages and followed the order AM &gt; PM &gt; M. To investigate the metabolic pathways leading to the differences in carbohydrate metabolism, pathways for processing carbohydrates were further explored at KEGG level 3 (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7C</a>). Most of the significant pathway differences were observed at day 3 of fermentation. In total, five and three pathways were significantly downregulated in M and PM silages, respectively, compared to AM silage. The most notably downregulated pathways in M silage were starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism and in PM silage were fructose and mannose metabolism and galactose metabolism. Additionally, three pathways, including ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, were significantly upregulated in M silage compared to AM silage.</div>

The correlations between bacterial species and fermentation characteristics and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were strong during the initial 3Â days and became weak after 60Â days of fermentation. After 3Â days of fermentation, enterobacterial species were positively correlated with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.

<div role=""paragraph"">The current study explored the influences of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on the fermentation characteristics of SSG through gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation. In the present study, gamma ray irradiation at a sufficient dose entirely sterilized the forage, which provided an ideal condition for studying the effects of exogenous microbiota inoculation on silage fermentation characteristics. The WSC content of the raw material is another important factor in silage fermentation (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). In line with our previous study, the WSC content of SSG in the present study satisfied the requirement (&gt;60 g/kg DM) for quality fermentation (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). It suggested the benefit of using SSG as the plant material in silage production.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The epiphytic microbiota, the microorganisms naturally present on the surface of plants, is responsible for silage fermentation (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). However, the aerial parts of plants form a highly diverse and dynamic environment where epiphytes need to cope with UV radiation exposure, low water and nutrient availability, and high temperature fluctuations throughout the day (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). Epiphytic microbiota compositions exhibit considerable variations in diurnal and temporal patterns (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). The epiphytic microorganisms of greatest concern in fermentation are LAB, enterobacteria, aerobic bacteria, and yeasts. Because silage is preserved by lactic acid fermentation, only epiphytic LAB are beneficial; others are considered undesirable, causing either fermentation failure or silage deterioration. The present results showed that epiphytic LAB counts decreased significantly in M and PM microbiota compared to the counts in AM microbiota. This was not surprising, since LAB lack many of the microbial traits that are found in phyllosphere-adapted bacteria. For example, many phyllosphere bacteria are pigmented and use these pigments to protect against high levels of UV radiation on leaf surfaces (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Similarly, Li et al. (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>) reported that 8Â h of UV exposure significantly decreased the LAB counts on Siberian wildrye. The yeast count also decreased during the day, suggesting their high sensitivity to the dynamic diurnal environment. However, this was inconsistent with our previous observation in Napier grass, where the yeast counts did not change significantly (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The discrepancy could be associated with the differences in leaf physical structures and nutrient conditions between the two forage crops (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). The M microbiota had the highest <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> counts, which was consistent with the enrichment of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span>. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. Unlike LAB, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> are yellow pigmented, motile, and grow in mucoid-forming colonies. These traits make them successful inhabitants in the phyllosphere (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). The dominance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> in M microbiota suggested that the harsh environment during the day may have an effect of enriching stress-resistant species in the phyllosphere.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Silage fermentation depends on epiphytic LAB converting WSC to organic acids, mainly lactic acid, along with reduction of the pH. It is generally accepted that at least 5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g LAB is required for adequate fermentation (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). Therefore, the differences in the epiphytic LAB populations may explain the varying rates of pH declines and organic acid production among the silages during fermentation. However, this could not explain the fermentation differences between M and PM silages, considering the comparable epiphytic LAB counts. One explanation could be the high enterobacterial number in M microbiota compared to the number in PM microbiota. Enterobacteria are principal competitors of LAB for available sugars during fermentation (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). The diurnally enriched enterobacteria may increase their competition with LAB, restrain LAB development, and further retard the fermentation. Likewise, Ãstling and Lindgren (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) have reported that inoculating a crop with enterobacteria resulted in temporarily retarded rates of lactic acid and acetic acid production. The acetic acid contents were observed to be highest in PM silage after 30Â days of fermentation, suggesting a greater activity of acetic acid-producing bacteria, such as heterolactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio is an indicator of the extent of homofermentation in relation to heterofermentation during fermentation (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). In the present study, all SSG silages had a ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid of &gt;2.0, suggesting the predominance of homofermentation during SSG fermentation. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio was higher in M silage after 14Â days of fermentation, suggesting stronger homofermentation than in the other silages.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Ethanol has little preservation effect and its production is associated with extremely high DM and energy losses in silage. More than 30 to 40 g/kg DM of ethanol production in silage is mainly associated with the action of yeasts (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In the present study, all SSG silages had ethanol contents of &lt;30 g/kg DM, suggesting that ethanol was mainly produced by microbes like heterolactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria. The NH<sub>3</sub>-N content is an indicator of the extent of protein breakdown in silage (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents of all silages were within the acceptable ranges of NH<sub>3</sub>-N (&lt;100 g/kg of TN), suggesting that SSG protein was well preserved during fermentation. Generally, NH<sub>3</sub>-N would accumulate continuously during fermentation. However, our results indicated that NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents decreased at the late stages of fermentation. A similar phenomenon has been reported by Ogunade et al. (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). In that study, they ascribed it to the oxidization of NH<sub>3</sub>-N under low dissolved oxygen conditions by some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Acidification by organic acids produced during fermentation is the main means of controlling the growth of undesirable microorganisms in silage. Therefore, it is not surprising that the populations of undesirable microorganisms, including aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeasts, showed overall tendencies to decrease during fermentation. The undesirable microorganisms remained in large counts in M silage for longer periods of time, which could be due to its slowest pH decline and organic acid production during fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Generally, diverse bacterial communities in crops are formed in the field and LAB development will simplify the bacterial community and result in a decline in alpha diversity during fermentation (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). Alpha diversity was low during the early stages of SSG fermentation and increased at the late stages of fermentation. This could be closely related to the changes in the LAB population; LAB multiplied extensively during the early stages of fermentation, reached the maximum number through 3 to 7âdays of fermentation, and then kept decreasing in the later fermentation period. The M silage had higher alpha diversity than the other silages during the initial 3Â days of fermentation. This was possibly due to its having the slowest pH decline, which did not effectively inhibit the undesirable microorganisms (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). According to the PCoA results, the bacterial community compositions at days 1 and 3 of fermentation were clearly separated by different inoculation groups. This suggested that the diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota significantly affected the bacterial community successions during the early stages of SSG fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The competition between LAB and undesirable microorganisms takes place during fermentation, and an anaerobic fermentation dominated by LAB is the key to producing a well-preserved silage (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span> were the first dominant LAB genera during SSG fermentation. These LAB species are the most isolated from standing plants, carrying out mixed acid fermentation and contributing to the initial pH decline during fermentation (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> was identified as the indicator LAB in AM silage, whereas <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span> was the indicator LAB in M silage at day 1 of fermentation. It suggested that the varying rates of acidification may result in the establishment of different niches that are favorable for different LAB species (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, more-acid-tolerant <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus</span> began to dominate the fermentation, along with the decreases in the relative abundances of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc</span>. The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus</span> bacteria mainly consisted of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span>, which is the most frequent LAB species in anaerobic plant matter, as well as in many fermented food products (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> generally contributes to the substantial lactic acid accumulation and desirable fermentation properties in silage because of its acid-resistant nature and superior ability to utilize a wide variety of substrates. The fastest dominance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> was consistent with the most rapid and intense lactic acid fermentation in AM silage. The relative abundance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus parabuchneri</span> was greater in PM silage after 60Â days of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus parabuchneri</span> is a heterofermentative LAB species producing acetic acid as its main product, and in addition, it can convert lactic acid into acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol in silage (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). These facts may partly explain the highest acetic acid contents in PM silage after 30Â days of fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Enterobacteria were the primary undesirable bacteria that showed differences in abundance in epiphytic microbiota and silages among different inoculation groups. The dominant enterobacteria in the epiphytic microbiota were mainly <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> species, whereas they were rapidly replaced by <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> after the beginning of fermentation. This was consistent with the report of Li and Nishino (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>) that the enterobacteria found on fresh grass would be replaced by enterobacterial species, which adapt better to the silage environment. After 3Â days of fermentation, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> was again detected in large abundance, suggesting that some members of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> genus could survive the anaerobic, acid environment. Similarly, Liang et al. (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>) reported that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> bacteria were detected apparently at early and late stages of <i>paocai</i> fermentation. Among the silages, enterobacteria, including <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span>, were specifically enriched in M silage at the early stages of fermentation. It is generally accepted that a rapid pH decline is the key to controlling enterobacteria in silage (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). Their prosperity could be due to the retarded fermentation that allowed them to persist longer in the silage. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> is a common genus during natural fermentation of various forage crops (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). A higher relative abundance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> could enhance the ammonia and biogenic amine production by deaminating and decarboxylating amino acids in silages (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella</span> species can destabilize silage aerobic stability, and some species are opportunistic pathogens that can cause mastitis in animals (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). The role of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> species in silage fermentation is less known. However, researchers consider that they have a role similar to that of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span> species, competing with LAB for available sugars during fermentation (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbial communities are shaped by interactions among the populations that affect the community dynamics and function (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). The exploration of cooccurrence networks offered new insight into the structure of complex microbial communities. The results demonstrated that the complexity of the bacterial networks decreased in M and PM silages compared to the bacterial network in AM silage. Hernandez et al. (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>) pointed out that the complexity of microbial networks would decrease along with the stress gradient. These results suggested that the stressful environment during the day may have acted as a strong filtering factor against the existing epiphytic bacterial species and affected the species cooccurrence patterns during fermentation. Butler and OâDwyer (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>) suggested that positive pairwise interactions can push communities closer to instability. The stressed bacterial communities had lower ratios of negative/positive interactions during fermentation, suggesting the lower stability of communities. The lower ratios of negative/positive interactions in the cooccurrence networks could be due to some âcompetitiveâ taxa that engaged in antagonistic interspecific interactions during fermentation being replaced by stress-tolerant species (e.g., oligotrophic microbes). For example, some OTUs affiliated with LAB species, such as <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactococcus</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span>, were replaced by bacterial species like <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span> or members of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Methylobacterium</span><i>-</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Methylorubrum</span> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In accordance with our previous study, carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and amino acid metabolism are the main metabolic pathways involved in silage fermentation (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). The epiphytic microbiota from various times had remarkably different functional profiles, suggesting their different metabolic potentials. The M and PM microbiota had more abundant cell community and greater cell motility than the AM microbiota. The increased abundances of these pathways could be associated with the enrichment of stress-resistant bacteria in SSG during the day. Different epiphytic microbiota induced various extents of upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism during fermentation, reflecting their different capacities in metabolizing WSC. Some carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly downregulated in M and PM silages compared to their regulation in AM silage after 3Â days of fermentation. These results suggested that the loss of function of the bacterial communities in metabolizing some types of carbohydrates contributed greatly to delayed fermentation in the silages. Notably, among the downregulated pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism were especially downregulated in M silage. Starch and sucrose are the major storage forms of carbohydrate in sorghum (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), and pyruvate is the precursor for the generation of organic acids like lactic acid, Î±-acetolactate, acetic acid, and formic acid (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). The downregulation of metabolism pathways related to those key carbohydrates and metabolites may strongly limit lactic acid fermentation, possibly explaining why fermentation was retarded to the greatest extent in M silage. Apart from the downregulated pathways, some carbohydrate metabolism pathways were observed to be upregulated in M silage compared to AM silage. These included ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. Yin et al. (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>) reported that metabolism of ascorbate and aldarate and C5-branched dibasic acid would consume large amounts of sugars. They suggested that the presence of these pathways would compete for the available sugars and shift the carbon flux away from lactic acid synthesis.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The flourishing of enterobacteria would deplete carbohydrate reserves and result in the failure of LAB to dominate fermentation (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, enterobacterial species were positively correlated with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. This confirmed that they were the main substrate competitors of LAB during the fermentation. Among the enterobacterial species, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span> was also positively correlated with the competing pathways, suggesting that diurnally enriched <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea</span> bacteria could increase the competitive pressure on LAB during fermentation. Enterobacterial species are sensitive to pH declines (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Therefore, they were positively correlated with pH and negatively correlated with lactic acid. Besides lactic acid, acetic acid also showed negative correlations with the enterobacterial species at day 1 of fermentation. Acetic acid is known to retard enterobacterial growth in silage (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Negative correlations between acetic acid and enterobacterial species suggested its important role in inhibiting enterobacterial growth at the initial stage of fermentation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">After 1Â day of fermentation, acetic acid and lactic acid were positively correlated with <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactococcus</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella</span>. Moreover, these LAB species also showed positive correlations with starch and sucrose metabolism and pyruvate metabolism. These results suggested that they played key roles in the production of organic acids and the control of enterobacteria at the initial stages of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> contains a comprehensive carbohydrate utilization system composed of plentiful sugar uptake- and metabolism-related genes that endow it with its strong carbohydrate utilization ability (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). After 3Â days of fermentation, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> were positively correlated with acetic acid, lactic acid, the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio, and a wide range of carbohydrate metabolism pathways. This confirmed the key role of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> in extensive carbohydrate metabolism and the production of organic acids during the fermentation process. After 60Â days of fermentation, the few correlations between bacterial species and fermentation characteristics indicate the decreasing effect of bacterial community on fermentation at the late stages. However, it was observed that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> was positively correlated with acetic acid after 60Â days of fermentation. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> possesses a complete set of genes for acetate catabolism via the glyoxylate cycle pathway (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). The positive correlation suggested that high acetic acid content may favor the survival and growth of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Kocuria rhizophila</span> in SSG silage. Aeromonads preferentially use ammonium as their nitrogen source (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Chitinophaga</span> bacteria were identified as the nitrifiers in activated sludge under low dissolved oxygen conditions (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>). Negative correlations of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aeromonas hydrophila</span> and <i>unclassified_g_</i><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Chitinophaga</span> with NH<sub>3</sub>-N suggested that these bacteria may be responsible for the decreased NH<sub>3</sub>-N contents at the late stages of fermentation.</div>
<section id=""sec-3-1"" data-type=""conclusions""><h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Gamma ray irradiation and microbiota transplantation offered the opportunity to evaluate the effects of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota on silage fermentation. The results showed that the epiphytic microbiota of SSG harvested at various times of the day varied greatly in composition and function. The diurnal variation affected the competition between LAB and enterobacteria, leading to increased proportions of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Pantoea dispersa</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Leuconostoc lactis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Enterobacter</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Klebsiella variicola</span>, whereas the proportions of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Weissella cibaria</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Lactobacillus plantarum</span> in M silage decreased during fermentation compared to their proportions in AM silage. Marked differences in fermentation characteristics were observed among the silages during the initial 7Â days of fermentation, with the fastest pH declines and organic acid production in AM silage and the slowest in M silage. Both M and PM silages exhibited decreases in the complexity and stability of bacterial networks compared to those in AM silage during the fermentation. Our study reveals the importance of diurnal variation of epiphytic microbiota in silage fermentation, which provides clues for technological parameter optimization for the fermentation process.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-4-1""><h3>Experimental material and inoculum preparation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (SSG; Sumu no. 03) was grown at Nanjing Agricultural University (32Â°01â²19â³N, 118Â°51â²08â³E, 25 m above sea level), Nanjing, China. The SSG was planted on 23 April 2021 in nine experimental plots (8 m by 5 m each), and all plots had the same tillage, irrigation, and fertilization practices. After 12 weeks of growth, these plots of SSG were randomly assigned to three harvest times (7.00Â h [AM], 12.00Â h [M], and 17.00Â h [PM]). Thus, this study had three sources of forage: AM-, M-, and PM-harvested SSG. At each harvest time, the temperature and relative humidity were measured with a temperature and humidity recorder (UT331; Youlide Instruments Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou, China), and the solar radiation intensity was recorded with a portable pyranometer (Metravi 207; Metravi Instruments Pvt. Ltd, West Bengal, India). The temperatures at the AM, M, and PM times were 26.9, 29.2, and 25.5Â°C, the relative humidity levels were 93.8, 86.1, and 95.2%, and the solar radiation intensities were 95.2, 312, and 152 W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The harvested SSG was chopped into lengths of ~1 to 2âcm for inoculum preparations. The inoculum of microbiota was prepared according to the method of Mogodiniyai Kasmaei et al. (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), with modifications. Briefly, a volume of 1,200âmL of Ringer solution fortified with Tween 80 at 0.5âmL/L was mixed with 333 g of SSG. The mixture was then kept in the orbital shaker at 120ârpm for 60âmin and filtered with four layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 15,500Â ÃÂ <i>g</i> for 10âmin. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 3âmL quarter-strength Ringer solution. Additionally, another batch of SSG was harvested, chopped (~1 to 2âcm), and used for silage preparation. Amounts of about 300 g of SSG were vacuum packaged into polyethylene plastic bags (30 by 40âcm). In total, 54 samples (3 inoculumsâÃâ6 storage periodsâÃâ3 replicates) were prepared and irradiated with gamma radiation at 32 kGy over 2Â h using a <sup>60</sup>Co source (Nanjing Xiyue Irradiation Technology Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China). The irradiated bags were opened in a laminar flow cabinet and inoculated with different sources of epiphytic microbiota (i.e., AM, M, and PM microbiota). According to the method of Mogodiniyai Kasmaei et al. (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), there were two assumptions for the inoculum: (i) the microbial population was removed entirely from the fresh forage and was evenly distributed in the liquid fraction, and (ii) the recovery of the microbial population from centrifugation was 90%. Therefore, the eluted inoculum (3âmL) represented the whole epiphytic bacterial population from 300 g of fresh forage. After inoculation, the bags were resealed and stored at room temperature (20 to 25Â°C). The bags were opened after 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60âdays of fermentation for chemical and microbial analyses.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-2""><h3>Experimental analyses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The pre-ensiling forage and silages were thoroughly mixed before chemical analyses. Approximately 100-g samples were oven dried for 48Â h at 60Â°C for dry matter (DM) determination. After that, dried samples were ground with a laboratory pulverizer (FW100; Taisite Instrument Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) to pass through a 1-mm screen for total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) measurements according to the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The crude protein (CP) content was calculated by multiplying TN by 6.25. The DM contents were corrected with the losses of volatiles during oven drying using the equations of Gallo et al. (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine the ensiling traits of fresh material and fermentation parameters of silage, ~20-g samples were blended with 180âmL distilled water and macerated for 24Â h at 4Â°C. The extracts were filtered through 2 layers of cheesecloth and a filter paper. The pH was measured with a Hanna HI 2221 pH meter (Hanna Instruments Italia Srl, Villafranca Padovana, Italy). The buffering capacity of fresh material and ammonia nitrogen (NH<sub>3</sub>-N) content of silage were determined using the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The organic acids (including lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) and ethanol were quantified using an Agilent 1260 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a refractive index detector (Carbomix H-NP5 column, 2.5âmM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5âmL/min).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For microbial population analyses, 10-g samples were thoroughly blended with 90âmL of sterilized saline solution on a shaker at 120ârpm for 90âmin. One hundred microliters of the blended liquid was serially diluted with sterilized saline solution. The LAB, aerobic bacteria, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and yeast counts were determined according to the methods of Dong et al. (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). After that, the remaining blended liquid was filtered into a 50-mL centrifuge tube with 4 layers of cheesecloth. The blended liquid was centrifuged at 4Â°C for 15âmin at 10,000ârpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was used for DNA extraction.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Bacterial diversity and community analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The DNA extraction was conducted using the FastDNA spin kit and the FastPrep instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) according to the manufacturerâs protocols. The quantity and quality of the DNA obtained were determined using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). Universal primers 338F and 806R were used for the PCR amplification, with the target being the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The PCR products were purified using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA) and quantified using QuantiFluor-ST (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The DNA were paired-end sequenced (2âÃâ300âbp) on an Illumina MiSeq PE300 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Raw sequences were processed using FLASH (version 1.2.11). The QIIME (version 1.9.1) quality control process was used to discard low-quality sequences (quality scores of &lt;20). Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME (version 1.7.0). Only sequences at least 200âbp long after quality filtering were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity level. The Î±-diversity estimators (Shannon, abundance-based coverage estimator [ACE], Chao1, and coverage indexes) were analyzed using QIIME (version 1.9.1). The Î²-diversity analysis, performed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), was used to visualize the variations in bacterial communities between samples using the UniFrac weighted-distance metric. The community structures of bacteria were analyzed at the genus and species levels using the Silva database (version 138) with a confidence threshold of 70%.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To identify the diurnal indicator bacteria, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) was performed with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score threshold of &gt;3.0. Stream graphs are used to show the bacterial community succession during fermentation (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). The correlations (|Ï|Â &gt;Â 0.06, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.05) among bacterial OTUs were analyzed by Spearmanâs rank correlations. The OTUs with relative abundances of &gt;0.01% were retained to construct cooccurrence networks. To compare the network structures, individual cooccurrence networks (for AM, M, and PM silages) were created using Gephi (version 0.9.2). According to the graph theory of cooccurrence networks, the average path length, average clustering coefficient, modularity, average degree, and graph density were calculated using the â<i>igraph</i>â package of R (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>).

<i>Coxiella burnetii</i> infects mononuclear phagocytes, where it directs biogenesis of a vacuolar niche termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Owing to its lumenal pH (â¼5) and fusion with endolysosomal vesicles, the PV is considered phagolysosome-like. However, the degradative properties of the mature PV are unknown, and there are conflicting reports on the maturation state and growth permissiveness of PV harboring virulent phase I or avirulent phase II <i>C. burnetii</i> variants in human mononuclear phagocytes. Here, we employed infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and THP-1 cells as host cells to directly compare the PV maturation kinetics and pathogen growth in cells infected with the Nine Mile phase I variant (NMI) or phase II variant (NMII) of <i>C. burnetii</i>. In both cell types, phase variants replicated with similar kinetics, achieving roughly 2 to 3 log units of growth before they reached stationary phase. HMDMs infected by either phase variant secreted similar amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In infected THP-1 cells, equal percentages of NMI and NMII PVs decorate with the early endosomal marker Rab5, the late endosomal/lysosomal markers Rab7 and CD63, and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D at early (8 h) and late (72 h) time points postinfection (p.i.). Mature PVs (2 to 4 days p.i.) harboring NMI or NMII contained proteolytically active cathepsins and quickly degraded <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These data suggest that <i>C. burnetii</i> does not actively inhibit phagolysosome function as a survival mechanism. Instead, NMI and NMII resist degradation to replicate in indistinguishable digestive PVs that fully mature through the endolysosomal pathway.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>Coxiella burnetii</i> is a wide-ranging facultative intracellular bacterium (<a href=""#R37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R37"">37</a>) that causes the zoonosis Q fever, a disease that generally manifests as an acute, debilitating flu-like illness (<a href=""#R34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R34"">34</a>). A small developmental form of the pathogen confers pronounced environmental stability (<a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>), a characteristic that facilitates aerosol transmission of the organism. Human infection primarily occurs via inhalation of contaminated material generated by domestic livestock, the primary animal reservoirs of <i>C. burnetii</i>. The organism is highly infectious, with the infective dose approaching one bacterium (<a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>). The main target cells of <i>C. burnetii</i> during natural infection are mononuclear phagocytes, such as alveolar macrophages (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>, <a href=""#R48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R48"">48</a>). Consequently, infection of cultured primary or immortalized human monocytes/macrophages is considered the most physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> model of <i>C. burnetii</i>-host cell interactions (<a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>). In human mononuclear phagocytes and other cell types, <i>C. burnetii</i> replicates within a membrane-bound compartment termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) (<a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The genetic intractability of <i>C. burnetii</i> has limited the availability of knowledge of the pathogen's virulence mechanisms and host-pathogen interactions. Currently, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the only confirmed virulence factor of the organism (<a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>). Full-length LPS is produced by virulent phase I organisms isolated from natural sources and infections, typified by the Nine Mile phase I variant (NMI) reference strain (strain RSA493). Serial passage of phase I <i>C. burnetii</i> in embryonated eggs or tissue culture selects for phase II bacteria, which produce a severely truncated LPS that lacks the O antigen and some core sugars (<a href=""#R20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R20"">20</a>, <a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>). A cloned phase II variant originating from NMI, termed Nine Mile phase II variant (NMII; strain RSA439, clone 4), has an â¼26-kb chromosomal deletion that eliminates multiple genes involved in LPS biosynthesis (<a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>, <a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>) and is avirulent for immunocompetent mice and guinea pigs (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>, <a href=""#R35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R35"">35</a>). NMII is a biosafety level 2 organism, while biosafety level 3 is required for all other <i>C. burnetii</i> strains.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A conundrum in <i>C. burnetii</i> biology is whether the virulence properties of NMI and NMII are associated with the ultimate maturation state of their respective PVs in resting primary human monocytes and/or macrophages (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>). PVs of both phase variants decorate with the late endosomal/lysosomal markers lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), CD63 (LAMP-3), and the vacuolar type H<sup>+</sup> ATPase and are moderately acidic (pH â¼5) (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>). However, on the basis of the minimal recruitment of cathepsin D and the small GTPase Rab7, it has been suggested that maturation of PVs containing NMI stalls at a late endosomal stage (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>). This trafficking behavior correlates with pathogen survival but in most cases little to no replication (<a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>, <a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>, <a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>). Conversely, PVs sheltering NMII are proposed to fully mature into a bactericidal phagolysosomal compartment that contains active lysosomal hydrolases (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>, <a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conflict with the phase-specific trafficking model in human mononuclear phagocytes is the observation that NMI and NMII both grow robustly in CD63-positive PVs of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Moreover, phase variants productively infect THP-1 cells and primary nonhuman primate alveolar macrophages, where they induce similar host cell prosurvival responses (<a href=""#R53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R53"">53</a>, <a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>). In animal cell lines, NMI and NMII replicate equally in vacuoles that fully mature to contain lysosomal markers (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>). For example, PVs harboring replicating NMI in murine L-929 fibroblasts and J774 macrophages clearly fuse with lysosomes, as evidenced by the presence of active acid phosphatase and 5â²-nucleotidase (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>, <a href=""#R11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R11"">11</a>, <a href=""#R25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R25"">25</a>). NMII has also recently been demonstrated to replicate in a cathepsin D-positive vacuole in human HeLa epithelial cells (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Because multiple laboratories have recently employed avirulent NMII to investigate <i>C. burnetii</i> infection of host cells (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R30"">30</a>, <a href=""#R38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R38"">38</a>, <a href=""#R50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R50"">50</a>, <a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>), it is important to ascertain the degree to which <i>in vitro</i> infection by NMII recapitulates infection by virulent NMI, particularly with respect to PV maturation in human mononuclear phagocytes. To this end, we directly compared the growth kinetics and PV maturation of NMI and NMII in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 cells, which accurately mimic the properties of human primary macrophages (<a href=""#R29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R29"">29</a>). Additionally, the cytokine responses of infected HMDMs were examined, as were the degradative properties and cathepsin activities of PVs. We conclude that human macrophages respond similarly to NMI and NMII <i>C. burnetii</i> by delivering organisms to phenotypically indistinguishable, degradative, phagolysosome-like compartments.</div>

<section id=""sec-1-1""><h3> <i>C. burnetii</i> and mammalian cell culture.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>C. burnetii</i> NMI (strain RSA493) and NMII (strain RSA439, clone 4) were propagated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (CCL-81; ATCC, Manassas, VA). <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> LGV-434, serotype L2, was cultivated in HeLa 229 cells (CCL-2; ATCC). Bacteria were isolated from infected cells by Renografin density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (<a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>, <a href=""#R45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R45"">45</a>), and stored at â80Â°C. The full-length and truncated LPSs of NMI and NMII, respectively, were validated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, as described previously (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>). Recent work in our laboratory has also confirmed the virulence and avirulence of NMI and NMII, respectively, for C57BL/6 mice (<a href=""#R44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R44"">44</a>; J. G. Shannon and R. A. Heinzen, unpublished data).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Human monocyte-like (THP-1) cells (TIB-202; ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Prior to infection, THP-1 cells were differentiated into adherent, macrophage-like cells by treating freshly plated cells with PMA (200 nM; EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 24 h. Human monocytes and HMDMs were derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of human donors. Buffy coats enriched in PBMCs were isolated by centrifugation of whole blood through a Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient. PBMCs were enriched for monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup> cells) using a RossetteSep monocyte enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). To differentiate monocytes into macrophages, monocytes were resuspended at 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml in macrophage medium (RPMI plus Glutamax [Invitrogen], 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] containing recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF] at 50 ng/ml [Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ]) and cultured for 6 days with addition of fresh cytokines on day 3. On day 6, the culture medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 155 mM NaCl, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). Adherent HMDMs were detached by incubation on ice in PBS, followed by gentle scraping. The cells were then plated in 24-well plates at a density of 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in macrophage medium.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-2""><h3>One-step growth curves.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The growth kinetics of <i>C. burnetii</i> NMI and NMII were established by using HMDMs or THP-1 cells (1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) cultivated in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Charlotte, NC). Here and elsewhere, cells were infected with NMI and NMII at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 100 and 10, respectively, by addition of organisms to cell culture medium. This time was considered 0 h postinfection (p.i.). A lower MOI was used for NMII because this variant is roughly 10-fold more infectious for cultured cells than NMI (<a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>). The MOI was based on <i>C. burnetii</i> genome equivalents, as described previously (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). Unless otherwise noted, the inoculum was left on the cells for 24 h, and then the cultures were washed and replenished with fresh medium.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>C. burnetii</i> replication was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) of genome equivalents. Samples were harvested from triplicate wells for each time point, and DNA from total infected cell lysates was isolated using an UltraClean microbial DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). <i>C. burnetii</i> genomes were quantified using a primer/probe set specific for <i>C. burnetii dotA</i>, as described previously (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). A standard curve was generated using purified plasmid containing <i>C. burnetii dotA</i> as a template. qPCR was performed using TaqMan universal PCR master mix and a Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</div></section><section id=""sec-1-3""><h3>Cytokine measurement.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">HMDMs were infected with NMI or NMII for 48 h without removal of the inoculum. The levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) present in the culture supernatants were determined using the BioPlex multiplex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, <i>Escherichia coli</i> O111:B4 LPS was added to uninfected cell cultures at a final concentration of 0.5 Î¼g/ml and was left in the medium throughout the 48 h of incubation.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-4""><h3>NMI and NMII coinfections.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To assess the trafficking of NMI and NMII in coinfected cells, HMDMs and THP-1 cells (1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells) cultivated on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates were infected with both phase variants. At the indicated times p.i., the cells were fixed and permeabilized with 100% cold methanol and then blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). NMII was specifically stained with undiluted monoclonal A6 hybridoma culture supernatant directed against NMII LPS (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-647 immunoglobulin G (IgG). NMI was specifically stained with diluted (1:2,500) rabbit polyclonal serum directed against NMI (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-594. The secondary antibodies used here and elsewhere were acquired from Invitrogen. The PV membrane was immunostained with CD63 (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>) using a monoclonal antibody (clone H5C6) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Cells were viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a modified Perkin-Elmer UltraView spinning-disch confocal system connected to a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. Confocal images (0.2-Î¼m sections) were acquired with a Ã60 oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.4) and a Photometrics Cascade II:512 digital camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Inc., Downingtown, PA). All images were processed similarly using ImageJ software (written by W. S. Rasband at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, and available from <a href=""http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/"">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</a> ) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). ImageJ was also used to quantify the fluorescence intensity.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-5""><h3>Trafficking of endolysosomal markers.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">PV recruitment of the endolysosomal markers Rab5, Rab7, CD63, and cathepsin D was investigated using THP-1 cells cultivated on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were infected with NMI or NMII for 2 h and then washed, and the medium was replenished. To assess the trafficking of Rab5 and Rab7, infected cells were transfected with pEGFP-Rab5 (<a href=""#R36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R36"">36</a>) or pEGFP-Rab7 (<a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>) using the Polyplus jetPEI macrophage transfection reagent (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) at 2 or 66 h p.i. Transfected cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde plus PBS, followed by permeabilization for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. To evaluate the trafficking of CD63 and cathepsin D, infected cells were fixed and permeabilized by treatment with 100% cold methanol for 10 min. Following fixation, the cells were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 5% BSA. <i>C. burnetii</i> was labeled with guinea pig polyclonal serum directed against formalin-fixed NMII and anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor-594 IgG. CD63 was labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone H5C6; BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 IgG. Cathepsin D was labeled with rabbit polyclonal serum directed against the human enzyme (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-484 IgG. Host and <i>C. burnetii</i> DNAs were labeled with DRAQ5 (Biostatus Limited, Leicestershire, United Kingdom). Cells were viewed by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described above. Endolysosomal markers were considered colocalized with the PV membrane if the average membrane fluorescence intensity was 20% or greater than the average total cell fluorescence.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-6""><h3>PV degradative activity.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The general degradative activity of NMI and NMII PVs was assessed by superinfecting <i>C. burnetii</i>-infected THP-1 cells with <i>E. coli</i> expressing mCherry red fluorescent protein. Degradation of <i>E. coli</i> within PVs was examined using static and time-lapse imaging of live cells and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of fixed cells. For static live-cell imaging, THP-1 cells were plated in 35-mm glass-bottomed petri dishes (1.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells). At 48 h p.i., NMI- or NMII-infected cells were superinfected with <i>E. coli</i> suspended in RPMI medium with 10% FBS at an MOI of 50. Noninternalized <i>E. coli</i> cells were washed from the monolayer after 1 h, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h to allow fusion of <i>E. coli</i> phagosomes with PV. Degradation of <i>E. coli</i> was assessed by phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon TE-2000 microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ digital camera (Roper Scientific, Tuscon, AZ). Images were acquired using Metamorph software and processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop. For time-lapse video microscopy of live cells, THP-1 cells (2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) were cultured in 24-well glass-bottomed SensoPlates (Greiner Bio-One North America, Inc., Monroe, NC). <i>E. coli</i> was added to wells containing THP-1 cells infected with NMII for 72 h. The culture plate was placed into a LiveCell stage top incubation system (Pathology Devices, Inc., Westminster, MD) and time-lapse video microscopy was conducted using a spinning-disk confocal fluorescence microscope as described above.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For TEM, THP-1 cells (5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells) in 24-well plates containing Thermanox coverslips (VWR, West Chester, PA) were infected and superinfected with <i>C. burnetii</i> and <i>E. coli</i>, respectively, as described above for static live-cell imaging. Monolayers were washed in cold PBS and fixed overnight at 4Â°C in 4% glutaraldehyde-4% paraformaldehyde. Following primary fixation, the samples were processed using a model 3451 laboratory microwave system (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) at ambient temperature, as follows. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 80 W for 45 s and then postfixed in a mixture of 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide in phosphate buffer at 80 W with two cycles of 2 min on, 2 min off, and 2 min on. Following one wash in phosphate buffer and two washes in water for 45 s each at 80 W, the samples were stained en bloc with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, as described above for postfixation. The samples were then rinsed in water for 45 s at 80 W. Samples were dehydrated in a series of 70%, 100%, and 100% ethanol for 45 s each at 250 W and then infiltrated with Spurr's resin in a series of 50%, 75%, 100%, 100%, and 100% for 3 min each at 250 W. The resin blocks were polymerized overnight at 65Â°C. Coverslips were removed from the blocks after exposure to liquid nitrogen for 5 s. The embedded cells were sectioned with a diamond knife, poststained with 1% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate, and examined with a model H7500 electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies USA, Pleasanton, CA) at 80 kV. Digital images were collected with an XR100 charge-coupled-device camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA).</div></section><section id=""sec-1-7""><h3>Evaluation of PV cathepsin activities.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To quantitatively assess PV cathepsin D activity, THP-1 cells (1.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) in 35-mm glass-bottomed petri dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) were infected with NMII for 32 h and then incubated for 16 h in medium containing Alexa Fluor-594 dextran (150 mg/ml; <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>, 10,000; Invitrogen) and DQ Green BSA (500 mg/ml; Invitrogen). The cells were then washed three times with tissue culture medium and incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C with fresh medium alone or medium containing DQ Green BSA with or without the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A (100 Î¼M; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The cells were washed once with cold PBS, and confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed as described above to quantify the fluorescence generated by the proteolysis of DQ Green BSA. Images for ratiometric calculations were acquired at wavelengths of 515 nm (DQ Green BSA) and 594 nm (Alexa Fluor-594 dextran). Data are expressed as the ratio of cleaved DQ Green BSA/Alexa Fluor-594 fluorescence signal intensities that were obtained from centrally located 0.2-Î¼m sections of individual PVs in a <i>Z</i>-series stack.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To qualitatively examine PV cathepsin D activity, THP-1 cells (2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) in 24-well glass-bottomed SensoPlates were infected for 48 h with NMI or NMII and then incubated for 2 h with DQ Red BSA (500 mg/ml; Invitrogen) with or without pepstatin A. Cells were visualized by phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Cathepsin B, K, and L activities were detected using the Magic Red (MR) fluorogenic substrates MR-(RR)<sub>2</sub>, MR-(LR)<sub>2</sub>, and MR-(FR)<sub>2</sub>, respectively (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC, Bloomington, MN), and the methods recommended by the supplier. Briefly, THP-1 cells (2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) in individual wells of a 24-well glass-bottomed SensoPlate were infected with NMI or NMII for 72 h or <i>C. trachomatis</i> (MOI = 10) for 24 h. The monolayers were washed twice with medium, and then 300 Î¼l of medium containing MR substrate was added to the culture dishes. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C and then visualized live by phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy. Time-lapse video confocal fluorescence microscopy of MR-(RR)<sub>2</sub> cleavage in NMII-infected THP-1 cells (72 h p.i.) was conducted as described above.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-2""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>NMI and NMII replicate with similar kinetics in HMDM and THP-1 cells.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">There are conflicting data on the growth permissiveness of human mononuclear phagocytes for <i>C. burnetii</i> phase variants (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>, <a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>, <a href=""#R54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R54"">54</a>). Therefore, one-step growth curves were generated for NMI and NMII in both HMDMs and THP-1 cells using qPCR to quantify genome equivalents (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). The growth kinetics of NMI and NMII were similar in both cell types (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>). Over an 11-day incubation, approximately 1.7- and 2.4-log-unit increases in genome equivalents were observed in HMDMs and THP-1 cells, respectively. Generation times during exponential phase (3 to 5 days p.i.) for NMI and NMII in HMDMs were 13.2 and 15.4 h, respectively. Faster growth was observed in THP-1 cells, with generation times being 11.0 and 12.6 h for NMI and NMII, respectively. NMI and NMII also grew similarly in undifferentiated primary human monocytes, with approximately 2 log units of growth being observed at 6 days p.i. (data not shown).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>HMDMs infected with NMI and NMII secrete comparable levels of proinflammatory cytokines.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We have previously shown that innate immune recognition of NMI by human DCs is attenuated (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by the shielding of NMI surface toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands by full-length LPS (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Conversely, interactions between NMII and human DCs result in the significant maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokines (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). To examine whether this behavior extends to interactions between <i>C. burnetii</i> phase variants and HMDMs, cells were infected for 48 h with NMI or NMII, and then the cell culture medium concentrations of TNF-Î± and IL-6 were determined. Similar amounts of each proinflammatory cytokine were secreted by cells infected with either phase variant (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>NMI and NMII replicate within the same PVs in HMDMs and THP-1 cells.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As an initial examination of the trafficking properties of NMI and NMII in human macrophages, HMDM and THP-1 cells were coinfected with both phase variants, and the localization of the organisms to common or distinct CD63-positive PVs was assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Roughly equal numbers of NMI and NMII were found in a common large and spacious PV at 2 days p.i. in both cell types (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). A similar observation was made at 4 and 6 days p.i. in THP-1 cells and HMDMs, respectively, with the PVs being nearly filled with replicating organisms at these time points. These results show that a single PV can support growth of both phase variants.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>PVs harboring NMI or NMII PV decorate similarly with endolysosomal markers.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The cohabitation of both phase variants in a common PV within coinfected human macrophages suggested that PVs harboring just NMI or NMII mature to a similar stage in the endolysosomal cascade. To examine PV maturation, trafficking of the early endosome marker Rab5, the late endosome marker Rab7, the late endosome/lysosome marker CD63 (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4</a> A), and the lysosome marker cathepsin D (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4B</a>) (<a href=""#R43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R43"">43</a>) was examined in infected THP-1 cells. The percentages of early (8 h p.i.) or late (72 h p.i.) NMI or NMII PVs that decorated with each marker were statistically the same (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4C</a>). The percentages of PVs positive for late endosome/lysosome markers increased from 8 to 72 h p.i. For example, the proportion of NMII PVs positive for CD63 increased from 77.0% Â± 5.1% to 98.0% Â± 1.7%. Moreover, at 72 h p.i., both NMI and NMII PVs showed high percentages of labeling for the lysosomal aspartate protease cathepsin D (81.0% Â± 13.3% and 80.0% Â± 6.1%, respectively). Acquisition of late endosome/lysosome markers correlated with decreased labeling for Rab5. For example, the percentage of NMII positive for Rab5 decreased from 50.0% Â± 5.3% to 12.0% Â± 4.6% between 8 and 72 h p.i. Collectively, these data suggest that PVs harboring NMI or NMII mature similarly through the endolysosomal pathway to ultimately acquire characteristics of a phagolysosome.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>NMI and NMII PVs are degradative, proteolytic compartments that contain active cathepsins.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Typical phagolysosomes are degradative compartments due to a diverse array of acid-activated lysosomal hydrolases (<a href=""#R31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R31"">31</a>). The degradative capacity of the <i>C. burnetii</i> PV is unknown. Thus, as an initial probe to determine whether <i>C. burnetii</i> recruitment of lysosomal markers correlates with degradative function, THP-1 cells infected with NMI or NMII for 48 h were superinfected for 3 h with <i>E. coli</i> expressing mCherry red fluorescent protein. Live cells were then visualized by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. <i>E. coli</i> cells that had trafficked to either NMI or NMII PVs were quickly degraded, indicated by the presence of disrupted organisms and released mCherry protein in the PV lumen (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5</a>). Indeed, time-lapse video microscopy shows the leakage of mCherry protein by <i>E. coli</i> within 5 min of entry into PVs, with some organisms being completely destroyed within 15 min of entry (see Video S1 in the supplemental material). Severely disrupted <i>E. coli</i> cells that appeared to be under osmotic stress were also evident by TEM (Fig. <a href=""#F5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Lysosomal proteases in <i>C. burnetii</i> PVs could contribute to degradation of <i>E. coli</i>. To determine if the vacuole is proteolytically active, THP-1 cells were infected with NMII for 32 h and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-594 dextran and DQ Green BSA for 16 h to allow fluid-phase uptake and trafficking to the PVs (<a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>). Alexa Fluor-594 dextran was employed to label the PVs with a nondigestible fluorescent probe. DQ Green BSA was used to qualitatively assess the proteolytic properties of the PVs. The molecule is a self-quenched 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacene (BODIPY) dye conjugate of BSA where quenching is relieved upon proteolysis of the protein to single dye-labeled peptides (<a href=""#R41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R41"">41</a>). A typical merged <i>Z</i>-series of confocal fluorescence micrographs showed a uniform distribution of red fluorescent dextran in the PV lumen. Conversely, green fluorescent cleaved DQ Green BSA showed a ring-like association with the PV membrane and a mottled distribution in the PV lumen (Fig. <a href=""#F6"">6</a> A). Membrane-associated fluorescence was also clearly evident in 0.2-Î¼m confocal slices (data not shown).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The distribution of fluorescent DQ Green BSA suggested that proteolytic activity is associated with the PV membrane. As shown in Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4B</a>, cathepsin D localizes to the PV membrane; however, the protease has inactive proenzyme and active mature forms that are not differentiated by the polyclonal serum used in this study (<a href=""#R55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R55"">55</a>). Therefore, we determined whether DQ Green BSA proteolysis and, potentially, presentation correlated with active cathepsin D. The assay was repeated with NMII-infected THP-1 cells that were incubated for 2 h prior to microscopy with medium alone or medium containing DQ Green BSA with or without pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D. DQ Green BSA/Alexa Fluor-594 dextran fluorescence ratios were then determined, as described in Materials and Methods. A significantly higher ratio was observed with PVs secondarily loaded with DQ Green BSA than with PVs secondarily loaded with DQ Green BSA plus pepstatin A or medium alone (Fig. <a href=""#F6"">6B</a>), indicating that active cathepsin D contributes to DQ Green BSA degradation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The lack of a confocal microscope in our biosafety level 3 laboratory precluded a similar quantitative analysis of NMI PV cathepsin D activity. However, a qualitative evaluation of activity was conducted by loading THP-1 cells infected for 48 h with DQ Red BSA and visualizing the PVs by phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy. NMI PVs showed substantial red fluorescence, indicating proteolysis of the substrate. The fluorescence was considerably reduced in cells treated with pepstatin A (Fig. <a href=""#F6"">6C</a>). A similar result was observed for NMII PV (data not shown).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To determine whether active cysteine proteases are also present in <i>C. burnetii</i> PVs, THP-1 cells infected for 72 h were stained with MR-(RR)<sub>2</sub>, a membrane-permeant cresyl violet-conjugated peptide that is a specific substrate of cathepsin B (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). As a control, cells containing <i>C. trachomatis</i> PVs (24 h p.i.), which have negligible interactions with the endocytic pathway (<a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>), were also stained. Intact MR-(RR)<sub>2</sub> is nonfluorescent, while the enzymatically cleaved substrate generates red fluorescence when it is excited at 500 to 590 nm. By phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy, PVs containing NMI or NMII showed intense red fluorescence 30 min after substrate addition (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7</a>). Time-lapse video microscopy shows the appearance of red fluorescence in PVs as early as 18 s after substrate addition (see Video S2 in the supplemental material). As expected, <i>C. trachomatis</i> PVs showed no fluorescence (Fig. <a href=""#F7"">7</a>). Similar results were obtained using MR substrates specific for cathepsins K and L (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that multiple proteolytically active cathepsins are present in both NMI and NMII PVs.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we show that virulent NMI and avirulent NMII traffic similarly in HMDMs and THP-1 cells to reside in a degradative, phagolysosome-like compartment that is permissive for growth. In each cell type they replicate with comparable kinetics; however, on the basis of the net increase in the numbers of <i>C. burnetii</i> genome equivalents between lag and stationary phases, THP-1 cells appear to be moderately more permissive for growth, showing a 2.5-log-unit increase, which is similar to that observed in nonphagocytic Vero cells (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). The occurrence of replicating NMI and NMII within the same PVs of coinfected human macrophages is consistent with the results of a previous study (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>) and further supports the idea that phase variants do not direct maturation of biologically distinct PV.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Although we did not specifically examine vacuolar pH, studies using ratiometric, pH-sensitive probes and different cell types have consistently shown that NMI and NMII PVs have a similar phagolysosome-like pH (â¼5) (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>, <a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>, <a href=""#R32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R32"">32</a>, <a href=""#R33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R33"">33</a>). This degree of acidification, along with the presence of active lysosomal hydrolases, is a reliable indicator of lysosome fusion (<a href=""#R41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R41"">41</a>). Akporiaye et al. (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>) determined that the overall activity of multiple lysosomal enzymes in cellular extracts of NMI-infected J774 murine macrophage-like cells is unaltered and, along with Howe and Mallavia (<a href=""#R25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R25"">25</a>), demonstrated that the lumen of individual PVs contains active acid phosphatase. This study demonstrates that PVs harboring NMI or NMII are proteolytically active and that both cysteine and aspartate cathepsins contribute to proteolysis. Cathepsin D has also been localized to NMII PVs in CHO and HeLa cells, where the vacuoles degrade DQ Green BSA (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R40"">40</a>). Notably, NMII shows no growth defect in either cell line (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R40"">40</a>). Interestingly, a recent report demonstrates that pretreatment of HMDMs with apoptotic lymphocytes enhances NMI replication, with a corresponding increase in the percentage of early PVs that decorate with cathepsin D (<a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>). Thus, fuller phagosome maturation in this context does not correlate with increased <i>C. burnetii</i> killing.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">How <i>C. burnetii</i> resists degradation by the lysosomal constituents of its PV is a puzzle. Resistance does not appear to require pathogen metabolism, as chloramphenicol-treated organisms remain viable for several days in lysosome-like vacuoles of Vero cells (<a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>). Furthermore, our results showing similar growth of NMI and NMII in human macrophages indicate that full-length LPS is not required for protection. One possible resistance mechanism is the production by <i>C. burnetii</i> of peptidoglycan-associated proteins that are protease resistant (<a href=""#R3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R3"">3</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Avirulence in intracellular bacteria is often associated with defects in phagosome modification. For example, mutants of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> deficient in phagosome arrest are quickly killed by macrophages (<a href=""#R39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R39"">39</a>). NMII avirulence is unrelated to phagosome arrest; instead, it appears to be strictly related to production of truncated LPS (<a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>). Indeed, using resequencing microarrays, we have recently found that, in addition to the 25,992-bp deletion of LPS biosynthesis genes, NMII has 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to the sequence of NMI, but none are predicted to disrupt the proteins required for intracellular growth and virulence (P. A. Beare and R. A. Heinzen, unpublished data). Full-length <i>C. burnetii</i> LPS acts as a virulence factor by shielding the outer membrane, thereby conferring resistance to complement-mediated killing (<a href=""#R51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R51"">51</a>) and masking surface TLR ligands from innate immune recognition by human DCs (<a href=""#R46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R46"">46</a>, <a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Exposure of NMII TLR surface ligands is thought to stimulate the potent activation, maturation, and release of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-12 and TNF-Î±) observed during <i>in vitro</i> infection of DCs (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Despite the differential activation of human DCs, NMI and NMII grow at equal rates in these cells (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). However, <i>in vivo</i>, this behavior is predicted to result in potentiated innate and adaptive immune responses to NMII relative to the response to NMI (<a href=""#R47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R47"">47</a>). Unlike DCs, HMDMs infected by NMI or NMII produce similar amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-Î± and IL-6). Phase variants also induce similar levels of TNF-Î± early after infection of murine P388D1 macrophage-like cells (<a href=""#R49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R49"">49</a>) and replicate similarly in these cells (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to primary human macrophages and DCs, NMI and NMII show similar growth characteristics in primary guinea pig macrophages (<a href=""#R28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R28"">28</a>) and all continuous cell lines examined, including murine macrophage-like cells (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R52"">52</a>). However, NMII does have severe growth defects relative to the growth of NMI in primary mouse macrophages (<a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>, <a href=""#R42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R42"">42</a>, <a href=""#R56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R56"">56</a>, <a href=""#R57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R57"">57</a>). NMII activation of the primary mouse macrophage pathogen recognition system by exposed TLR ligands may induce production of a cellular effector that limits replication.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">NMI and NMII appear to engage different macrophage/monocyte receptors (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). However, in our hands, this does not result in different phagosome maturation states or pathogen growth. We conclude that infection of primary human macrophages and human macrophage/monocyte-like cell lines by avirulent NMII represents a physiologically accurate system to model <i>C. burnetii</i>-host cell interactions.</div></section><div role=""paragraph"">

<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> has emerged as a major bioinsecticide on the global market. It offers a valuable alternative to chemical products classically utilized to control pest insects. Despite the efficiency of several strains and products available on the market, the scientific community is always on the lookout for novel toxins that can replace or supplement the existing products. In this study, H3, a novel <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain showing mosquitocidal activity, was isolated from Lebanese soil and characterized <i>in vivo</i> at genomic and proteomic levels. H3 parasporal crystal is toxic on its own but displays an unusual killing profile with a higher 50% lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) than the reference <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> serovar israelensis crystal proteins. In addition, H3 has a different toxicity order: it is more toxic to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Anopheles gambiae</span> than to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Culex pipiens</span>. Whole-genome sequencing and crystal analysis revealed that H3 can produce 11 novel Cry proteins, 8 of which are assembled in genes with an <i>orf1-gap-orf2</i> organization, where <i>orf2</i> is a potential Cry4-type crystallization domain. Moreover, pH3-180, the toxin-carrying plasmid, holds a wide repertoire of mobile genetic elements that amount to ca. 22% of its size., including novel insertion sequences and class II transposable elements. Two other large plasmids present in H3 carry genetic determinants for the production of many interesting moleculesâsuch as chitinase, cellulase, and bacitracinâthat may add up to H3 bioactive properties. This paper therefore reports a novel mosquitocidal <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus thuringiensis</span> strain with unusual Cry toxin genes in a rich mobile DNA environment.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cereus sensu lato</span>, a diverse group of spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria, contains nine closely related species with a wide pathogenicity spectrum but whose exact phylogeny remains a matter of debate (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a><a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">â</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus thuringiensis</span>, a soil-dwelling bacterium, is one of the best-studied members of this group. In fact, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains are commercialized and used worldwide as biopesticides in an effort to replace harmful chemical insecticides in the fight against disease-carrying and phytopathogenic insects. Their entomopathogenic capacities are due to a parasporal crystal, formed during sporulation and consisting of Î´-endotoxins (or Cry), sometimes associated with Cyt cytotoxins. This crystal is solubilized after ingestion by the alkaline environment of the target larva midgut (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Cry toxins, activated by proteases, bind to specific receptors localized in the apical microvilli of insect midgut cells. This is followed by an oligomerization of the toxins and their insertion into the apical membrane, leading to the formation of pores that cause intestinal cell lysis and consequently the death of the insect larvae (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). So far, the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> toxin database, set up by Crickmore et al. (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) (<a href=""https://www.bpprc.org/"">https://www.bpprc.org/</a> [<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>]) encompasses 73 families of three-domain (3D) Cry toxins. Whereas domain I presents an Î±-helical structure and is involved in toxin oligomerization and membrane insertion thus pore formation, domains II and III have Î²-prism and Î²-sheet structures, respectively, and have been found to mediate recognition and interaction with insect gut protein receptors (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). A key feature of all Cry toxins is their receptor specificity. The combination of Cry toxins produced by a particular strain determines its host spectrum (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). In contrast, Cyt toxins are cytolytic endotoxins that act via nonspecific detergent-like (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>) or pore-forming (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>) models. Remarkably, Cyt toxins may show significant homology with proteins produced by distant microorganisms, such as volvatoxin A2, a heat-labile cardiotoxin produced by the straw mushroom <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Volvariella volvacea</span> (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), as well as other proteins found in pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium kluyveri</span> or <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces venezuelae</span>) (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The combination of various toxins in the same crystal leads to synergistic interactions among Cry toxins or between Cry and Cyt toxins when both are present. The synergy can increase toxicity and play against the emergence of resistant insect populations (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). This has been observed, for instance, for the combination of Cry2A and Cry4B (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>) and for that of Cry21Fa1 and Cry21Ha1 (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Similar observations have been made in the case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> serovar (sv.) israelensis, in which Cyt1A helps Cry4 toxins to overcome resistance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> larvae (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Cyt1A was also found to act as a receptor and anchor for Cry11Aa to increase its toxicity to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aedes aegypti</span> larvae (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), and Cyt1A and Cyt2A were shown to synergize Cry4B toxins, at a ratio as low as 1% in the mix (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis is an example of a highly effective combination of toxins. It is the reference for antidipteran activity, to which no resistance has been observed in the field despite its long usage as a biocontrol agent due to the mix of Cry toxins as well as the presence of the Cyt toxins (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Its crystal is composed of Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry10Aa, Cry11Aa, Cyt1Aa, and Cyt2Ba, with Cyt being the major component. These toxin-encoding genes are located on the 128-kb toxin-carrying plasmid pBtoxis (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Plasmids are part of the repertoire of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of each strain. Some of these extrachromosomal entities can be conjugative (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), mobilizable, or of prophage-like nature (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Another group of MGEs are transposable elements (TEs), which can move from one location to another within the same genome. They include insertion sequences (IS), with a simple organization of two inverted repeats flanking a transposase-coding gene (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>), or more complex elements, such as class II TEs (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). TEs also include composite transposons, with two IS flanking one or more passenger genes (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). In addition, MGEs comprise group II introns, which have a complex secondary RNA structure (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cereus</span> repeats small DNA fragments found only in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus</span> group (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). In this group, the occurrence and distribution of MGE types and families vary greatly among its members, as has recently been shown (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Plasmids, more specifically those carrying toxin genetic determinants, are key elements of the ecology and adaptation of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus sensu lato</span> species, especially in the case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, whose plasmid percentage of the genome is 2.66 times higher than that of its closest relative, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus sensu stricto</span> (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Toxin-carrying plasmids form up to 30% of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> plasmid pool, and toxin-coding genes are often associated with transposable elements (TEs), such as IS or class II transposable elements (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a><a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">â</a><a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">In this study, we characterized a new antidipteran <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain, isolated from Lebanese soil, whose spore-crystal mixture lacks Cyt toxins and displays a novel <i>in vivo</i> killing profile.

<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Bacterial strains and bioassays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain H3 was isolated from a soil sample from the region of Harissa (Lebanon). This strain produces a round parasporal crystal. In an effort to find new antidipteran <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains, the H3 crystal-spore mixture was tested against third-instar larvae of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Culex pipiens</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Anopheles gambiae</span>. Initial survival tests were performed using five crystal proteins concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40âÎ¼g/ml). H3 was noticeably less toxic to <i>Culex</i> than to <i>Anopheles</i> and <i>Aedes</i> (<a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>), with 50% lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) values after 24 h of 221âÂ±â98, 15.8âÂ±â3.43, and 7.6âÂ±â0.88 Âµg/ml, respectively. As shown in <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>, for a Î´-endotoxin concentration of 40âÂµg/ml, the survival rate was ca. 80% for <i>C. pipiens</i> larvae after 24 h, compared to 24% and 10% for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">A. gambiae</span> and <i>A. albopictus</i>, respectively. As for the reference strain <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis AM65-52, the LC<sub>50</sub> values, calculated 2 h 30 min postinfection for <i>Culex</i>, 3 h 30 min postinfection for <i>Anopheles</i>, and 5 h postinfection for <i>Aedes</i>, were 7.4âÂ±â0.11, 33.36âÂ±â0.5, and 8.39âÂ±â0.09 ng/ml, respectively (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While AM65-52 showed the highest activity against <i>Culex</i>, this was not the case for H3, which was most toxic to <i>Aedes</i> larvae, on which additional bioassays were conducted. Third-instar <i>A. albopictus</i> larvae were exposed to various combinations of H3 and AM65-52 spore-crystal mixtures at a final concentration of 40âÂµg/ml of toxin. Subsequently, the 50% lethal time (LT<sub>50</sub>) of the combination and that AM65-52 spore-crystal mixture alone were compared. The combination of H3 and AM65-52 resulted in a reduction of the AM65-52 LT<sub>50</sub> via a potential additive effect for all tested combinations with varied proportions of the spore-crystal mixtures (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). For instance, in a comparison of the 90:10 ratio of H3 to AM65-52 to AM65-52 alone at a 10% ratio of the total 40-Âµg/ml concentration (i.e., at 4âÂµg/ml), the observed LT<sub>50</sub> was ca. 60 instead of 80âmin.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The Cry toxin composition of strain H3 was then assessed for its protein profile, which was compared to that of AM65-52. The two strains did not share any protein bands, reflecting their different crystal compositions (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a>). Moreover, PCR screening of genes encoding known antidipteran Cry proteins (Cry4A/B, Cry10, and Cry11) was negative with only a partial segment of the 5â² end of the <i>cry4B</i> gene amplified with Dip2A-Dip2B primers (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that strain H3 produces new antidipteran toxins. PCR with genes encoding Cyt toxins (Cyt1A and Cyt2B) was also negative, meaning that H3, contrary to classic antidipteran strains, does not produce those Cyt toxins. Moreover, washed, solubilized, and filtered crystals of H3 and AM65-52 were tested on 5% sheep blood agar. While AM65-52 crystals showed a clear halo where the blood cells were lysed, H3 crystals did not (Fig. S2).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Whole-genome sequencing of strain H3.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In order to characterize the potentially new Cry toxins produced by strain H3, a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach was performed using PacBio, with Illumina MiSeq polishing. The assembled genome of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> H3 consists of four replicons: a chromosome of 5,487,336âbp and three large plasmids: pH3-552 (552,228âbp), pH3-180 (180,731âbp), and pH3-101 (101,260âbp). Sequences of the 6,321,555-bp genome were deposited in NCBI genome database under the BioProject identifier (ID) <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA611745"">PRJNA611745</a> and GenBank accession numbers <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP052061"">CP052061</a> to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP052064"">CP052064</a>. Sequence information for each replicon is shown in <a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""T2"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The H3 chromosome was aligned with the chromosomes of 12 <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains and one <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cytotoxicus</span> strain using progressiveMauve (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). Following this alignment, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted and compared between strains. On the basis of SNP divergence between the strains, a maximum-likelihood relationship dendrogram was constructed. This analysis showed that H3 is closely related to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. sichuansis strain MC28 (GenBank accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP003687.1"">CP003687.1</a> [<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>]) as shown by the relationship analysis (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>). Both strains showed antidipteran activity. As for H3 plasmids, they amount to ca. 12% of the H3 genome.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Novel insecticidal toxins.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Eleven putative insecticidal <i>cry</i> genes were identified on pH3-180 (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>) by Prokka and BtToxin_scanner annotations. Encoded proteins were compared by BLAST.P (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>) to the NCBI nonredundant protein database and checked for the Î´-endotoxin conserved domains by CDART (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). No <i>cyt</i> genes were found in the entire H3 genome. As shown in <a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>, seven H3 Cry proteins contain at least two conserved key insecticidal domains, one or two N-terminal endotoxin domains, and the C-terminal carbohydrate binding modules. Parts of the endotoxin domains are cleaved and eliminated during toxin activation to subsequently allow membrane insertion and pore formation. As for the carbohydrate binding module, it is implicated in toxin-receptor interactions (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>).</div>

<header></header><figure id=""T3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Four other genes (all designated ORF2) were also annotated as potentially associated with an insecticidal function. The proteins they encode contain a newly recognized crystallization domain following CDART analysis (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>) and present a high sequence similarity to each other and to the C-terminal part of Cry4-type proteins. In comparison to Cry4Ba5 from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis plasmid pBtoxis, the conserved area is located from amino acid position 656 to the end of the protein (Fig. S3). This high sequence similarity strongly suggests a conserved function with the crystallization domain of Cry4-type proteins, which is essential for their inclusion in the parasporal crystal (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). Interestingly, the genes encoding these proteins are located downstream of those encompassing conserved domains, with a short intergenic distance (max. 68ânt), as indicated in <a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of these gaps are almost identical, especially just before the start codon of <i>orf2</i>, where the consensus sequence is <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">T-aaAAAGGTtGTGAaTcaT</span> (upper- and lowercase letters indicate a more- or less-conserved nucleotide in the gap sequence). This sequence is also found in full-length <i>cry4</i>-type genes, upstream of the conserved C-terminal coding part. This is in line with a previous study that suggested a common origin for these <i>orf2</i> coding genes: a truncated C-terminal part of a <i>cry4</i>-type gene that resulted from a rearrangement leading to an <i>orf1</i>-gap-<i>orf2</i> organization (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In order to confirm that H3 actually expresses these <i>cry</i> genes, a detailed characterization of the protein content of the whole crystal was conducted using nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS) (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). The resulting peptides were used to identify the various proteins by homology search in the UniProt <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> database. These peptides were cross-checked with the 11 Cry proteins predicted by WGS. The results confirmed the presence of the 11 potential proteins in H3 crystal: 7 with the conserved insecticidal domains, ranging in size between 78.19 and 91.24âkDa, and 4 with a newly identified crystallization domain, ranging between 55 and 65âkDa (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a> and Table S3).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Each of the seven newly identified Cry proteins with conserved insecticidal domains was compared to entries from the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> nomenclature database (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), following which a name was designated (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>). Proteins showing less than 45% sequence similarities with annotated Cry proteins from the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> nomenclature database, hence not passing the rank 1 threshold, were assigned as three-domain Cry toxins (3D Cry H3-1 and H3-2). Four other proteins showing sequence identity between 45 and 78% to annotated Cry toxins were consequently labeled Cry50-, Cry54-, Cry68-, and Cry71-like proteins. The last of the seven proteins, passing the rank2 threshold of 78% sequence identity with Cry70B, was named Cry70B-like protein.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>pH3-180, the unusual mosquitocidal plasmid.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">pH3-180 is the only toxin-carrying plasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> H3. In addition to <i>cry</i> genes, pH3-180 holds 35 elements belonging to 10 IS and class II transposable element families (Table S1) and one group II intron (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>). Interestingly, ca. 22% of pH3-180 is occupied by IS and Tn<i>3</i>-like elements. Some IS elements, such as the IS<i>240A</i>-like element from the IS<i>6</i> family, are also found on <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis 128-kb toxin plasmid pBtoxis (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>), while others, like IS<i>Bth166</i> from the IS<i>110</i> family, are absent from pBtoxis.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The most abundant element on pH3-180 is the IS<i>Bth20</i>-like element (IS<i>6</i> family), present in 12 copies. The abundance of this element and its distribution on pH3-180 increase the possibility of forming composite transposons, with two IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements flanking one or more passenger genes. Even though composite transposons are not limited by size, those with the closest bordering IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements and a size under 10âkb are shown in Table S2. However, the two most noteworthy are those where IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements flank toxin-coding genes, as highlighted in <a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a> by golden arcs on the outermost circle. Such is the case for the first transposon, with <i>cry70B</i>-like, the <i>B.th.</i>I3-like group II intron, and a Tn<i>4430</i>-like transposase-coding gene, flanked by two iso-IS<i>Bth20</i> elements in opposite orientations. The second composite transposon includes two iso-IS<i>Bth20</i> elements in the same orientation flanking the <i>cry54</i>-like gene and its downstream <i>orf2</i>, as well as a phospholipase C-coding gene.pH3-180 also holds a transposase-coding gene from a potentially new family, identified as a <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">PD-(D/E)XK</span> nuclease family transposase. This superfamily encompasses proteins with diverse functional niches, such as DNA restriction, tRNA splicing, and DNA transposition (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Although this protein superfamily remains somewhat unexplored in the transposition research field, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">PD-(D/E)XK</span> putative transposase has been located in a number of microorganisms, including archaeal and bacterial strains (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two new class II transposable elements were identified on pH3-180 and were designated Tn<i>Bth5</i> and Tn<i>Bth6</i>. The former has a characteristic Tn<i>3</i> family organization with 49- and 50-bp terminal inverted repeats flanking transposase- and resolvase-coding genes in opposite orientations (Fig. S4A). Interestingly, a second and identical copy of Tn<i>Bth5</i> is present on the 100-kb plasmid pH3-101. As for Tn<i>Bth6</i>, it holds three coding DNA sequences (CDSs) in the same orientation, one of which is a resolvase and the other two seem to belong to a disrupted class II transposase (Fig. S4B). These CDSs are flanked by 48- and 50-bp-long inverted repeats.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Other TEs include the aforementioned <i>B.th</i>.I3-like group II intron, originally found in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis strain ATCC 35646 within a gene coding a reverse transcriptase (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). In the case of strain H3, this element is missing ca. 500âbp at the 3â² end in comparison with <i>B.th.</i>I3 and carries a 335-amino-acid group II intron reverse transcriptase/maturase. The <i>B.th.</i>I3-like intron is located between an insecticidal toxin-coding gene and an IS<i>Bth20</i>-like element, as mentioned above, without disrupting any CDS. In addition to these MGEs, seven tyrosine recombinase/integrase-coding genes are distributed on pH3-180. They may function independently or in association with other pH3-180 mobile elements.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Other interesting features.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to toxin genes and mobile elements, pH3-180 carries two operons containing three and two spore germination protein-encoding genes (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>). Moreover, pH3-180 holds two copies of a gene encoding the sporulation initiation inhibitor protein Soj (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) and one <i>abrB</i> gene, whose function is to control the transition from vegetative state to sporulation (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). Interestingly, a similar situation is observed for pH3-552, the large coresident plasmid, which harbors several genetic loci related to spore formation or germination.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Beside the Cry toxins, several noteworthy features are associated with strain H3 and could intervene in its interaction with surrounding environment. Many of these features are carried by the 552-kb megaplasmid pH3-552. These include several putative two-component systems and six ABC transporter systems. Concerning antibiotics, pH3-552 holds potential genetic determinants for fosfomycin resistance and bacitracin and gramicidin S synthesis. Strain H3 also carries genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, also referred to as cell wall-degrading enzymes: cellulase, on pH3-552, and chitinase, on pH3-552 and the chromosome. Two other types of bioactive molecules, siderophores and lassopeptides, potentially produced by strain H3 are encoded on the chromosome.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Diptera, especially mosquitoes, serve as vectors for the transmission of many animal diseases, such as malaria, dengue, or yellow fever. So far, the commonly used method to fight these vector-borne diseases is to kill the mosquitoes with synthetic chemical insecticides. However, biopesticides, more particularly those based on <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, are slowly but surely taking over the insecticide market. Nonetheless, the need for prevention of potential emergence of resistant strains due to the prolonged use of the same combination of toxins in the field has motivated the search and characterization of novel insecticidal strains and toxins. In this study, a new <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain, H3, isolated from Lebanese soil and active against dipteran larvae was characterized for both its insecticidal potential and genomic composition.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Strain H3 is toxic for third-instar larvae of <i>A. albopictus</i>, <i>C. pipiens</i>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">A. gambiae</span> but at a higher dose than the reference <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> israelensis serovar. However, H3 crystal lacks Cyt toxins, which could explain the observed higher dose required for its toxicity. Interesting results were also obtained with the combinations of H3 and AM65-52 spore-crystal mixture, following which the LT<sub>50</sub> of AM65-52 was reduced. This raised a question regarding the nature of the interaction between the crystal toxins of AM65-52 and H3, which can be either an additive effect or a synergistic interaction. If indeed the observed effect stems from synergy between the toxins of the two strains, a second question ensues, which evokes the identity of the main actors in this interaction from the two strainsâ crystal proteins. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis Cyt toxins are a major component of the crystal and have a key role in its toxicity through their individual and synergistic activities with Cry toxins (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a><a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">â</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In fact, thanks to their capacity to recognize and interact with the phospholipids of the insect midgut cells, Cyt toxins can act as receptors for Cry toxins in case of a shift or to simply increase the number of receptor-toxin interactions. This is why Cyt toxins, particularly Cyt1A, are well-known key players in the described synergism in many cases with several <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> Cry toxins (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a><a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">â</a><a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Nonetheless, the possibility of synergistic interactions between the Cry toxins of the two strains cannot be excluded. Hence, three aspects need to be further explored in future experiments, which will consist of detailed synergistic tests between (i) Cyt1Aa and H3 crystal proteins, (ii) Cyt1Aa and individually cloned H3 crystal proteins, and (iii) paired combinations of individually cloned H3 and AM65-52 crystal proteins (i.e., Cry4Aa with Cry70B-like protein and Cry10Aa with Cry68-like protein).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Moreover, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis is known to be more toxic to <i>Culex</i> than to <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> larvae (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), in contrast to H3. Since the dose- and time-dependent killing profiles are indications of activity via specific receptors in the insect midgut, this led us to believe that H3 toxins kill the larvae in a different way than what was described for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis. In agreement with the observed difference in toxicities between H3 and the reference <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis AM652-52, the crystal protein profile of the former is also completely different from that of the latter. In order to get more insight into the genetics and genomics of H3 entomotoxins, a whole-genome sequencing approach was used. The strain H3 chromosome appeared to be closely related to the chromosome of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. sichuansis MC28, which also displays antidipteran activity (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). Moreover, H3 holds three new large plasmids, accounting for almost 12% of its genome, hence, in size, a higher-than-average plasmid percentage (11.2%) but a lower plasmid number per strain of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> (6.4 plasmids per stain [<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>]).pH3-180, the toxin-carrying plasmid, harbors 11 putative <i>cry</i> genes coding for potential parasporal crystal toxins. Seven of these proteins hold conserved insecticidal domains, of which five were placed in specific three-domain Cry toxins families displaying mosquitocidal activity (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>) (Cry50, Cry54, Cry68, Cry70, and Cry71). The remaining two proteins (3D Cry H3-1 and H3-2) did not show enough protein sequence identity with any known Cry family but contained conserved insecticidal domains found in three-domain Cry toxins (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>). Even though these seven proteins have the necessary domains for insecticidal activity, it is unclear which one(s) is responsible for H3 antidipteran activity, since these toxins are new and not characterized yet. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is needed for the assessment of the individual toxicity of each protein and the identification of its target receptors in the insect midgut.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">As for the remaining four, they are designated ORF2 proteins, thought to be indispensable for correct expression, folding, and crystallization of the Cry toxin to which they are associated, as shown by previous studies. Barboza-Corona et al. have indeed shown that in the case of the <i>cry19A</i> operon, ORF2 enhances the synthesis and crystallization of Cry19A by functioning as a C-terminal crystallization domain (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>). This was also demonstrated later on for Cry30 (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), Cry5B (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), and Cry65A (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). Another important <i>orf1</i>-gap-<i>orf2</i> operon organization is that of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis Cry10Aa protein, which requires ORF2 for correct crystallization, in contrast to Cry11Aa, which benefits from the presence of the 20-kDa helper protein p20 (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>, <a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>). A 2015 study by Peng et al. suggested that this could be a new evolutionary strategy for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> Cry proteins and could explain why some Cry proteins cannot form crystals when expressed alone in an acrystalliferous strain (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). Interestingly, though, in the case of H3, four toxin genes adopt the <i>orf1-gap-orf2</i> organization.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">pH3-180 is also quite unusual for the abundance of TEs, including more than 35 IS and class II elements, a group II intron, and several potential composite transposons. For comparison, the large coresident pH3-552 plasmid (552âkb) holds only eight IS elements, belonging to three families (IS<i>3</i>, IS<i>200</i>/IS<i>605</i>, and IS<i>4</i>). Toxin-carrying plasmids in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> are no strangers to TEs, since they hold a good proportion of the total plasmidial IS, Tn<i>3</i>-like elements, and group II introns (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). As previously mentioned, several TEs were found to be associated with toxin-coding genes (e.g., IS<i>231</i> [<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>]) and, when active, to shuffle the <i>cry</i> genes within the bacterial genome and also among strains in the case of conjugation/mobilization events. Of notice, however, is the 22% of pH3-180 occupied by TEs, a figure much higher than the average of 7.46% for toxin-carrying plasmids (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>) and the 3.8% for the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis pBtoxis plasmid (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). This is also much higher than the IS/Tn<i>3</i>-like element proportions of pH3-101 (5.9%) and pH3-552 (1.9%).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">TE prevalence in toxin-carrying plasmids compared to other plasmids may underline an evolutionary adaptation mechanism, due to their contribution to the diversity of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> virulence and its insect host spectrum. Not only are toxin-carrying plasmids important for the ecological function of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, but also they play key roles in other cellular functions, such as sporulation/germination. Some studies have suggested that these plasmids are the defining genomic entity for the recognition of a strain as a member of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> species (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), although in some rare cases, <i>cry</i> genes were found on the chromosome, surrounded by IS elements, a possible reason for their mobility from plasmid to chromosome (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Another aspect of H3 toxicity brought to light by the whole-genome sequencing is a group of bioactive molecules possibly produced by H3. Many of these molecules are encoded by pH3-552. They include bacitracin (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>) and gramicidin S (<a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>), cyclic nonribosomal peptides mostly active against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, H3, like other <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains, potentially produces chitinase, an enzyme with great potential as an agent for biocontrol of pathogenic fungi (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>) and as an added value to the insecticidal activity thanks to the degradation of chitin laminating the intestinal peritrophic membrane (<a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>). Copies of the chitinase gene are found on the H3 chromosome as well as pH3-552.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The H3 chromosome also carries clusters for two other potential bioactive molecules: siderophores, iron-scavenging molecules that may act as biocontrol agents by chelating iron and reducing its bioavailability (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), and lassopeptides, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a unique 3-dimensional structure and a wide spectrum of antimicrobial and analgesic activities (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, H3 is an interesting <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain with a new plasmidial content, including a wide MGE repertoire within pH3-180, the toxin-carrying plasmid. The novelty of H3 Cry proteins, with their different killing profile, is encouraging for their potential use in the field as coformulants to the classic antidipteran strains. Nevertheless, these findings also raise several issues that pave the way for future studies, such as the individual toxicity of each of these new toxins and the identification of the receptors to which they bind, the role of ORF2 in the expression and correct folding of its associated protein, and, finally, the potential activity and effect of TEs within the toxin-carrying plasmid pH3-180.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus thuringiensis</span>, a soil entomopathogenic bacterium, is at the base of many sustainable eco-friendly bioinsecticides. Hence stems the need to continually characterize insecticidal toxins. H3 is an antidipteran <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain, isolated from Lebanese soil, whose parasporal crystal contains 11 novel Cry toxins and no Cyt toxins.

Moreover, this plasmid is extremely rich in mobile genetic elements, unlike its two coresidents. This highlights the important underlying evolutionary traits between toxin-carrying plasmids and the adaptation of a <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain to its environment and insect host spectrum.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cereus sensu lato</span>, a diverse group of spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria, contains nine closely related species with a wide pathogenicity spectrum but whose exact phylogeny remains a matter of debate (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a><a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">â</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus thuringiensis</span>, a soil-dwelling bacterium, is one of the best-studied members of this group. In fact, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains are commercialized and used worldwide as biopesticides in an effort to replace harmful chemical insecticides in the fight against disease-carrying and phytopathogenic insects. Their entomopathogenic capacities are due to a parasporal crystal, formed during sporulation and consisting of Î´-endotoxins (or Cry), sometimes associated with Cyt cytotoxins. This crystal is solubilized after ingestion by the alkaline environment of the target larva midgut (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Cry toxins, activated by proteases, bind to specific receptors localized in the apical microvilli of insect midgut cells. This is followed by an oligomerization of the toxins and their insertion into the apical membrane, leading to the formation of pores that cause intestinal cell lysis and consequently the death of the insect larvae (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). So far, the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> toxin database, set up by Crickmore et al. (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) (<a href=""https://www.bpprc.org/"">https://www.bpprc.org/</a> [<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>]) encompasses 73 families of three-domain (3D) Cry toxins. Whereas domain I presents an Î±-helical structure and is involved in toxin oligomerization and membrane insertion thus pore formation, domains II and III have Î²-prism and Î²-sheet structures, respectively, and have been found to mediate recognition and interaction with insect gut protein receptors (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). A key feature of all Cry toxins is their receptor specificity. The combination of Cry toxins produced by a particular strain determines its host spectrum (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). In contrast, Cyt toxins are cytolytic endotoxins that act via nonspecific detergent-like (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>) or pore-forming (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>) models. Remarkably, Cyt toxins may show significant homology with proteins produced by distant microorganisms, such as volvatoxin A2, a heat-labile cardiotoxin produced by the straw mushroom <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Volvariella volvacea</span> (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), as well as other proteins found in pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium kluyveri</span> or <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces venezuelae</span>) (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The combination of various toxins in the same crystal leads to synergistic interactions among Cry toxins or between Cry and Cyt toxins when both are present. The synergy can increase toxicity and play against the emergence of resistant insect populations (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). This has been observed, for instance, for the combination of Cry2A and Cry4B (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>) and for that of Cry21Fa1 and Cry21Ha1 (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Similar observations have been made in the case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> serovar (sv.) israelensis, in which Cyt1A helps Cry4 toxins to overcome resistance of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Culex quinquefasciatus</span> larvae (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Cyt1A was also found to act as a receptor and anchor for Cry11Aa to increase its toxicity to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aedes aegypti</span> larvae (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), and Cyt1A and Cyt2A were shown to synergize Cry4B toxins, at a ratio as low as 1% in the mix (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis is an example of a highly effective combination of toxins. It is the reference for antidipteran activity, to which no resistance has been observed in the field despite its long usage as a biocontrol agent due to the mix of Cry toxins as well as the presence of the Cyt toxins (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). Its crystal is composed of Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry10Aa, Cry11Aa, Cyt1Aa, and Cyt2Ba, with Cyt being the major component. These toxin-encoding genes are located on the 128-kb toxin-carrying plasmid pBtoxis (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Plasmids are part of the repertoire of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of each strain. Some of these extrachromosomal entities can be conjugative (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), mobilizable, or of prophage-like nature (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Another group of MGEs are transposable elements (TEs), which can move from one location to another within the same genome. They include insertion sequences (IS), with a simple organization of two inverted repeats flanking a transposase-coding gene (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>), or more complex elements, such as class II TEs (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). TEs also include composite transposons, with two IS flanking one or more passenger genes (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). In addition, MGEs comprise group II introns, which have a complex secondary RNA structure (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cereus</span> repeats small DNA fragments found only in the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus</span> group (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). In this group, the occurrence and distribution of MGE types and families vary greatly among its members, as has recently been shown (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Plasmids, more specifically those carrying toxin genetic determinants, are key elements of the ecology and adaptation of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus sensu lato</span> species, especially in the case of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, whose plasmid percentage of the genome is 2.66 times higher than that of its closest relative, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. cereus sensu stricto</span> (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>).

<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Bacterial strains and bioassays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain H3 was isolated from a soil sample from the region of Harissa (Lebanon). This strain produces a round parasporal crystal. In an effort to find new antidipteran <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains, the H3 crystal-spore mixture was tested against third-instar larvae of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Culex pipiens</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Anopheles gambiae</span>. Initial survival tests were performed using five crystal proteins concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40âÎ¼g/ml). H3 was noticeably less toxic to <i>Culex</i> than to <i>Anopheles</i> and <i>Aedes</i> (<a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>), with 50% lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) values after 24 h of 221âÂ±â98, 15.8âÂ±â3.43, and 7.6âÂ±â0.88 Âµg/ml, respectively. As shown in <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>, for a Î´-endotoxin concentration of 40âÂµg/ml, the survival rate was ca. 80% for <i>C. pipiens</i> larvae after 24 h, compared to 24% and 10% for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">A. gambiae</span> and <i>A. albopictus</i>, respectively. As for the reference strain <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis AM65-52, the LC<sub>50</sub> values, calculated 2 h 30 min postinfection for <i>Culex</i>, 3 h 30 min postinfection for <i>Anopheles</i>, and 5 h postinfection for <i>Aedes</i>, were 7.4âÂ±â0.11, 33.36âÂ±â0.5, and 8.39âÂ±â0.09 ng/ml, respectively (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While AM65-52 showed the highest activity against <i>Culex</i>, this was not the case for H3, which was most toxic to <i>Aedes</i> larvae, on which additional bioassays were conducted. Third-instar <i>A. albopictus</i> larvae were exposed to various combinations of H3 and AM65-52 spore-crystal mixtures at a final concentration of 40âÂµg/ml of toxin. Subsequently, the 50% lethal time (LT<sub>50</sub>) of the combination and that AM65-52 spore-crystal mixture alone were compared. The combination of H3 and AM65-52 resulted in a reduction of the AM65-52 LT<sub>50</sub> via a potential additive effect for all tested combinations with varied proportions of the spore-crystal mixtures (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). For instance, in a comparison of the 90:10 ratio of H3 to AM65-52 to AM65-52 alone at a 10% ratio of the total 40-Âµg/ml concentration (i.e., at 4âÂµg/ml), the observed LT<sub>50</sub> was ca. 60 instead of 80âmin.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The Cry toxin composition of strain H3 was then assessed for its protein profile, which was compared to that of AM65-52. The two strains did not share any protein bands, reflecting their different crystal compositions (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a>). Moreover, PCR screening of genes encoding known antidipteran Cry proteins (Cry4A/B, Cry10, and Cry11) was negative with only a partial segment of the 5â² end of the <i>cry4B</i> gene amplified with Dip2A-Dip2B primers (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that strain H3 produces new antidipteran toxins. PCR with genes encoding Cyt toxins (Cyt1A and Cyt2B) was also negative, meaning that H3, contrary to classic antidipteran strains, does not produce those Cyt toxins. Moreover, washed, solubilized, and filtered crystals of H3 and AM65-52 were tested on 5% sheep blood agar. While AM65-52 crystals showed a clear halo where the blood cells were lysed, H3 crystals did not (Fig. S2).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Whole-genome sequencing of strain H3.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In order to characterize the potentially new Cry toxins produced by strain H3, a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach was performed using PacBio, with Illumina MiSeq polishing. The assembled genome of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> H3 consists of four replicons: a chromosome of 5,487,336âbp and three large plasmids: pH3-552 (552,228âbp), pH3-180 (180,731âbp), and pH3-101 (101,260âbp). Sequences of the 6,321,555-bp genome were deposited in NCBI genome database under the BioProject identifier (ID) <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA611745"">PRJNA611745</a> and GenBank accession numbers <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP052061"">CP052061</a> to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP052064"">CP052064</a>. Sequence information for each replicon is shown in <a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""T2"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The H3 chromosome was aligned with the chromosomes of 12 <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains and one <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus cytotoxicus</span> strain using progressiveMauve (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). Following this alignment, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted and compared between strains. On the basis of SNP divergence between the strains, a maximum-likelihood relationship dendrogram was constructed. This analysis showed that H3 is closely related to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. sichuansis strain MC28 (GenBank accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP003687.1"">CP003687.1</a> [<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>]) as shown by the relationship analysis (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>). Both strains showed antidipteran activity. As for H3 plasmids, they amount to ca. 12% of the H3 genome.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Novel insecticidal toxins.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Eleven putative insecticidal <i>cry</i> genes were identified on pH3-180 (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>) by Prokka and BtToxin_scanner annotations. Encoded proteins were compared by BLAST.P (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>) to the NCBI nonredundant protein database and checked for the Î´-endotoxin conserved domains by CDART (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). No <i>cyt</i> genes were found in the entire H3 genome. As shown in <a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>, seven H3 Cry proteins contain at least two conserved key insecticidal domains, one or two N-terminal endotoxin domains, and the C-terminal carbohydrate binding modules. Parts of the endotoxin domains are cleaved and eliminated during toxin activation to subsequently allow membrane insertion and pore formation. As for the carbohydrate binding module, it is implicated in toxin-receptor interactions (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>).</div>

<header></header><figure id=""T3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Four other genes (all designated ORF2) were also annotated as potentially associated with an insecticidal function. The proteins they encode contain a newly recognized crystallization domain following CDART analysis (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>) and present a high sequence similarity to each other and to the C-terminal part of Cry4-type proteins. In comparison to Cry4Ba5 from <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis plasmid pBtoxis, the conserved area is located from amino acid position 656 to the end of the protein (Fig. S3). This high sequence similarity strongly suggests a conserved function with the crystallization domain of Cry4-type proteins, which is essential for their inclusion in the parasporal crystal (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). Interestingly, the genes encoding these proteins are located downstream of those encompassing conserved domains, with a short intergenic distance (max. 68ânt), as indicated in <a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of these gaps are almost identical, especially just before the start codon of <i>orf2</i>, where the consensus sequence is <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">T-aaAAAGGTtGTGAaTcaT</span> (upper- and lowercase letters indicate a more- or less-conserved nucleotide in the gap sequence). This sequence is also found in full-length <i>cry4</i>-type genes, upstream of the conserved C-terminal coding part. This is in line with a previous study that suggested a common origin for these <i>orf2</i> coding genes: a truncated C-terminal part of a <i>cry4</i>-type gene that resulted from a rearrangement leading to an <i>orf1</i>-gap-<i>orf2</i> organization (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In order to confirm that H3 actually expresses these <i>cry</i> genes, a detailed characterization of the protein content of the whole crystal was conducted using nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS) (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). The resulting peptides were used to identify the various proteins by homology search in the UniProt <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> database. These peptides were cross-checked with the 11 Cry proteins predicted by WGS. The results confirmed the presence of the 11 potential proteins in H3 crystal: 7 with the conserved insecticidal domains, ranging in size between 78.19 and 91.24âkDa, and 4 with a newly identified crystallization domain, ranging between 55 and 65âkDa (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a> and Table S3).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Each of the seven newly identified Cry proteins with conserved insecticidal domains was compared to entries from the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> nomenclature database (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), following which a name was designated (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>). Proteins showing less than 45% sequence similarities with annotated Cry proteins from the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> nomenclature database, hence not passing the rank 1 threshold, were assigned as three-domain Cry toxins (3D Cry H3-1 and H3-2). Four other proteins showing sequence identity between 45 and 78% to annotated Cry toxins were consequently labeled Cry50-, Cry54-, Cry68-, and Cry71-like proteins. The last of the seven proteins, passing the rank2 threshold of 78% sequence identity with Cry70B, was named Cry70B-like protein.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>pH3-180, the unusual mosquitocidal plasmid.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">pH3-180 is the only toxin-carrying plasmid of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> H3. In addition to <i>cry</i> genes, pH3-180 holds 35 elements belonging to 10 IS and class II transposable element families (Table S1) and one group II intron (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>). Interestingly, ca. 22% of pH3-180 is occupied by IS and Tn<i>3</i>-like elements. Some IS elements, such as the IS<i>240A</i>-like element from the IS<i>6</i> family, are also found on <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis 128-kb toxin plasmid pBtoxis (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>), while others, like IS<i>Bth166</i> from the IS<i>110</i> family, are absent from pBtoxis.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The most abundant element on pH3-180 is the IS<i>Bth20</i>-like element (IS<i>6</i> family), present in 12 copies. The abundance of this element and its distribution on pH3-180 increase the possibility of forming composite transposons, with two IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements flanking one or more passenger genes. Even though composite transposons are not limited by size, those with the closest bordering IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements and a size under 10âkb are shown in Table S2. However, the two most noteworthy are those where IS<i>Bth20</i>-like elements flank toxin-coding genes, as highlighted in <a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a> by golden arcs on the outermost circle. Such is the case for the first transposon, with <i>cry70B</i>-like, the <i>B.th.</i>I3-like group II intron, and a Tn<i>4430</i>-like transposase-coding gene, flanked by two iso-IS<i>Bth20</i> elements in opposite orientations. The second composite transposon includes two iso-IS<i>Bth20</i> elements in the same orientation flanking the <i>cry54</i>-like gene and its downstream <i>orf2</i>, as well as a phospholipase C-coding gene.pH3-180 also holds a transposase-coding gene from a potentially new family, identified as a <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">PD-(D/E)XK</span> nuclease family transposase. This superfamily encompasses proteins with diverse functional niches, such as DNA restriction, tRNA splicing, and DNA transposition (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Although this protein superfamily remains somewhat unexplored in the transposition research field, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""gene"">PD-(D/E)XK</span> putative transposase has been located in a number of microorganisms, including archaeal and bacterial strains (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two new class II transposable elements were identified on pH3-180 and were designated Tn<i>Bth5</i> and Tn<i>Bth6</i>. The former has a characteristic Tn<i>3</i> family organization with 49- and 50-bp terminal inverted repeats flanking transposase- and resolvase-coding genes in opposite orientations (Fig. S4A). Interestingly, a second and identical copy of Tn<i>Bth5</i> is present on the 100-kb plasmid pH3-101. As for Tn<i>Bth6</i>, it holds three coding DNA sequences (CDSs) in the same orientation, one of which is a resolvase and the other two seem to belong to a disrupted class II transposase (Fig. S4B). These CDSs are flanked by 48- and 50-bp-long inverted repeats.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Other TEs include the aforementioned <i>B.th</i>.I3-like group II intron, originally found in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis strain ATCC 35646 within a gene coding a reverse transcriptase (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). In the case of strain H3, this element is missing ca. 500âbp at the 3â² end in comparison with <i>B.th.</i>I3 and carries a 335-amino-acid group II intron reverse transcriptase/maturase. The <i>B.th.</i>I3-like intron is located between an insecticidal toxin-coding gene and an IS<i>Bth20</i>-like element, as mentioned above, without disrupting any CDS. In addition to these MGEs, seven tyrosine recombinase/integrase-coding genes are distributed on pH3-180. They may function independently or in association with other pH3-180 mobile elements.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Other interesting features.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In addition to toxin genes and mobile elements, pH3-180 carries two operons containing three and two spore germination protein-encoding genes (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>). Moreover, pH3-180 holds two copies of a gene encoding the sporulation initiation inhibitor protein Soj (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) and one <i>abrB</i> gene, whose function is to control the transition from vegetative state to sporulation (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). Interestingly, a similar situation is observed for pH3-552, the large coresident plasmid, which harbors several genetic loci related to spore formation or germination.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Beside the Cry toxins, several noteworthy features are associated with strain H3 and could intervene in its interaction with surrounding environment. Many of these features are carried by the 552-kb megaplasmid pH3-552. These include several putative two-component systems and six ABC transporter systems. Concerning antibiotics, pH3-552 holds potential genetic determinants for fosfomycin resistance and bacitracin and gramicidin S synthesis. Strain H3 also carries genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, also referred to as cell wall-degrading enzymes: cellulase, on pH3-552, and chitinase, on pH3-552 and the chromosome. Two other types of bioactive molecules, siderophores and lassopeptides, potentially produced by strain H3 are encoded on the chromosome.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Diptera, especially mosquitoes, serve as vectors for the transmission of many animal diseases, such as malaria, dengue, or yellow fever. So far, the commonly used method to fight these vector-borne diseases is to kill the mosquitoes with synthetic chemical insecticides. However, biopesticides, more particularly those based on <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, are slowly but surely taking over the insecticide market. Nonetheless, the need for prevention of potential emergence of resistant strains due to the prolonged use of the same combination of toxins in the field has motivated the search and characterization of novel insecticidal strains and toxins. In this study, a new <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain, H3, isolated from Lebanese soil and active against dipteran larvae was characterized for both its insecticidal potential and genomic composition.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Strain H3 is toxic for third-instar larvae of <i>A. albopictus</i>, <i>C. pipiens</i>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">A. gambiae</span> but at a higher dose than the reference <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> israelensis serovar. However, H3 crystal lacks Cyt toxins, which could explain the observed higher dose required for its toxicity. Interesting results were also obtained with the combinations of H3 and AM65-52 spore-crystal mixture, following which the LT<sub>50</sub> of AM65-52 was reduced. This raised a question regarding the nature of the interaction between the crystal toxins of AM65-52 and H3, which can be either an additive effect or a synergistic interaction. If indeed the observed effect stems from synergy between the toxins of the two strains, a second question ensues, which evokes the identity of the main actors in this interaction from the two strainsâ crystal proteins. <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis Cyt toxins are a major component of the crystal and have a key role in its toxicity through their individual and synergistic activities with Cry toxins (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a><a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">â</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In fact, thanks to their capacity to recognize and interact with the phospholipids of the insect midgut cells, Cyt toxins can act as receptors for Cry toxins in case of a shift or to simply increase the number of receptor-toxin interactions. This is why Cyt toxins, particularly Cyt1A, are well-known key players in the described synergism in many cases with several <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> Cry toxins (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a><a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">â</a><a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Nonetheless, the possibility of synergistic interactions between the Cry toxins of the two strains cannot be excluded. Hence, three aspects need to be further explored in future experiments, which will consist of detailed synergistic tests between (i) Cyt1Aa and H3 crystal proteins, (ii) Cyt1Aa and individually cloned H3 crystal proteins, and (iii) paired combinations of individually cloned H3 and AM65-52 crystal proteins (i.e., Cry4Aa with Cry70B-like protein and Cry10Aa with Cry68-like protein).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Moreover, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis is known to be more toxic to <i>Culex</i> than to <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> larvae (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), in contrast to H3. Since the dose- and time-dependent killing profiles are indications of activity via specific receptors in the insect midgut, this led us to believe that H3 toxins kill the larvae in a different way than what was described for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis. In agreement with the observed difference in toxicities between H3 and the reference <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis AM652-52, the crystal protein profile of the former is also completely different from that of the latter. In order to get more insight into the genetics and genomics of H3 entomotoxins, a whole-genome sequencing approach was used. The strain H3 chromosome appeared to be closely related to the chromosome of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. sichuansis MC28, which also displays antidipteran activity (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>). Moreover, H3 holds three new large plasmids, accounting for almost 12% of its genome, hence, in size, a higher-than-average plasmid percentage (11.2%) but a lower plasmid number per strain of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> (6.4 plasmids per stain [<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>]).pH3-180, the toxin-carrying plasmid, harbors 11 putative <i>cry</i> genes coding for potential parasporal crystal toxins. Seven of these proteins hold conserved insecticidal domains, of which five were placed in specific three-domain Cry toxins families displaying mosquitocidal activity (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>) (Cry50, Cry54, Cry68, Cry70, and Cry71). The remaining two proteins (3D Cry H3-1 and H3-2) did not show enough protein sequence identity with any known Cry family but contained conserved insecticidal domains found in three-domain Cry toxins (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>). Even though these seven proteins have the necessary domains for insecticidal activity, it is unclear which one(s) is responsible for H3 antidipteran activity, since these toxins are new and not characterized yet. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is needed for the assessment of the individual toxicity of each protein and the identification of its target receptors in the insect midgut.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">As for the remaining four, they are designated ORF2 proteins, thought to be indispensable for correct expression, folding, and crystallization of the Cry toxin to which they are associated, as shown by previous studies. Barboza-Corona et al. have indeed shown that in the case of the <i>cry19A</i> operon, ORF2 enhances the synthesis and crystallization of Cry19A by functioning as a C-terminal crystallization domain (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>). This was also demonstrated later on for Cry30 (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), Cry5B (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), and Cry65A (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). Another important <i>orf1</i>-gap-<i>orf2</i> operon organization is that of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis Cry10Aa protein, which requires ORF2 for correct crystallization, in contrast to Cry11Aa, which benefits from the presence of the 20-kDa helper protein p20 (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>, <a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>). A 2015 study by Peng et al. suggested that this could be a new evolutionary strategy for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> Cry proteins and could explain why some Cry proteins cannot form crystals when expressed alone in an acrystalliferous strain (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). Interestingly, though, in the case of H3, four toxin genes adopt the <i>orf1-gap-orf2</i> organization.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">pH3-180 is also quite unusual for the abundance of TEs, including more than 35 IS and class II elements, a group II intron, and several potential composite transposons. For comparison, the large coresident pH3-552 plasmid (552âkb) holds only eight IS elements, belonging to three families (IS<i>3</i>, IS<i>200</i>/IS<i>605</i>, and IS<i>4</i>). Toxin-carrying plasmids in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> are no strangers to TEs, since they hold a good proportion of the total plasmidial IS, Tn<i>3</i>-like elements, and group II introns (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). As previously mentioned, several TEs were found to be associated with toxin-coding genes (e.g., IS<i>231</i> [<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>]) and, when active, to shuffle the <i>cry</i> genes within the bacterial genome and also among strains in the case of conjugation/mobilization events. Of notice, however, is the 22% of pH3-180 occupied by TEs, a figure much higher than the average of 7.46% for toxin-carrying plasmids (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>) and the 3.8% for the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> sv. israelensis pBtoxis plasmid (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). This is also much higher than the IS/Tn<i>3</i>-like element proportions of pH3-101 (5.9%) and pH3-552 (1.9%).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">TE prevalence in toxin-carrying plasmids compared to other plasmids may underline an evolutionary adaptation mechanism, due to their contribution to the diversity of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> virulence and its insect host spectrum. Not only are toxin-carrying plasmids important for the ecological function of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span>, but also they play key roles in other cellular functions, such as sporulation/germination. Some studies have suggested that these plasmids are the defining genomic entity for the recognition of a strain as a member of the <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> species (<a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), although in some rare cases, <i>cry</i> genes were found on the chromosome, surrounded by IS elements, a possible reason for their mobility from plasmid to chromosome (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Another aspect of H3 toxicity brought to light by the whole-genome sequencing is a group of bioactive molecules possibly produced by H3. Many of these molecules are encoded by pH3-552. They include bacitracin (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>) and gramicidin S (<a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>), cyclic nonribosomal peptides mostly active against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, H3, like other <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strains, potentially produces chitinase, an enzyme with great potential as an agent for biocontrol of pathogenic fungi (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>) and as an added value to the insecticidal activity thanks to the degradation of chitin laminating the intestinal peritrophic membrane (<a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>). Copies of the chitinase gene are found on the H3 chromosome as well as pH3-552.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The H3 chromosome also carries clusters for two other potential bioactive molecules: siderophores, iron-scavenging molecules that may act as biocontrol agents by chelating iron and reducing its bioavailability (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), and lassopeptides, ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a unique 3-dimensional structure and a wide spectrum of antimicrobial and analgesic activities (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, H3 is an interesting <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">B. thuringiensis</span> strain with a new plasmidial content, including a wide MGE repertoire within pH3-180, the toxin-carrying plasmid. The novelty of H3 Cry proteins, with their different killing profile, is encouraging for their potential use in the field as coformulants to the classic antidipteran strains. Nevertheless, these findings also raise several issues that pave the way for future studies, such as the individual toxicity of each of these new toxins and the identification of the receptors to which they bind, the role of ORF2 in the expression and correct folding of its associated protein, and, finally, the potential activity and effect of TEs within the toxin-carrying plasmid pH3-180.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00542-21","<div role=""paragraph"">Public health practices and high vaccination rates currently represent the primary interventions for managing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We initiated a clinical study based on frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission among employees and their household members. We hypothesized that the study would reduce the economic burden and loss of productivity of both individuals and small businesses resulting from standard isolation methods, while providing new insights into virus-host dynamics. Study participants (27 employees and 27 household members) consented to provide frequent nasal or oral swab samples that were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two study participants were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the study. One subject, a household member, was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for at least 71âdays and had quantifiable serum virus-specific antibody concentrations for over 1 year. One unrelated employee became positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study but remained asymptomatic, with low associated viral RNA copy numbers, no detectable serum IgM and IgG concentrations, and IgA concentrations that decayed rapidly (half-life: 1.3 days). A COVID-19 infection model was used to predict that without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees (95% confidence interval [CI]â=â3 to 10) would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization. Our scalable and transferable surveillance plan met its primary objectives and represents a powerful example of an innovative public health initiative dovetailed with scientific discovery.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has precipitated a global pandemic heavily challenging our social behavior, economy, and health care infrastructure.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Worldwide, recovery from this active, devastating outbreak cannot begin until safe and effective medicines for treatment and prevention are available and accessible globally. In the interim, it is essential to use the rapidly expanding scientific knowledge on the novel SARS-CoV-2 to update guidelines for COVID-19 patient management as well as protection of the uninfected population. The implementation of social distancing, frequent and thorough hand washing, isolation, and the use of face coverings (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>) has helped curb the incidence of COVID-19 in many parts of the United States, and these measures continue to be important until high vaccination rates have been achieved. Our ability to design and introduce effective public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of the viral pathogenesis and dynamics, fundamental aspects of the disease that remain largely unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Workplace SARS-CoV-2 transmission is believed to represent an important contributor to the global COVID-19 pandemic, especially as countries attempt to spur economic activity (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). In a significant proportion of infected individuals, the disease manifests itself with mild or no symptoms (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>), and managing asymptomatic carriers, so-called âsilent spreaders,â represents a significant challenge in controlling the pandemic (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). This concern is heightened by findings suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates are similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Workplace transmission from SARS-CoV-2 carriers with mild or no symptoms therefore is a potentially important mode of spreading the highly communicable disease and represents a significant occupational health risk. Infected workers subsequently are susceptible to transmitting the virus further to household members. When workplace COVID-19 acquisition occurs, standard protective measures require all employees who have been in contact with the infected individual to self-quarantine for 2âweeks. This can effectively close units and businesses even though a proportion of the isolated workers may not have contracted the virus. Based on this rationale, the development and assessment of measures to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the workplace are highly significant and necessary to provide a safe occupational environment.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In a 15 May 2020 interview, James W. Curran, Dean, Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, stated, âAccurate surveillance is the conscience and guidepost for public healthâ (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The current clinical study builds on this foundational principle and consists of longitudinal and intensive characterization of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence at the Oak Crest Institute of Science (Oak Crest), a nonprofit science research organization in Southern California. The two primary study objectives were to (i) characterize the rate of COVID-19 acquisition in a small cohort of workers interacting on a daily basis in the workplace and (ii) determine the utility of these data in managing workplace COVID-19 exposure, minimizing further spread as per public health advisories. Exploratory aims include characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission between Oak Crest employees and their household members and measuring the viral dynamics in infected individuals from the study cohort.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Study participants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 54 subjects participated in the study over the first 3 months, 27 Oak Crest employees, students, and volunteers and 27 household members. Retention of study subjects was 100%. The corresponding demographics are presented in <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Sample collection efficiency.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The majority of clinical specimens consisted of nasal swab samples. Only 3 of the 54 participants (5.6%) could not tolerate the nasal swab procedure and self-collected oral samples instead. A total of 942 samples were analyzed in the 3-month study. <a href=""#fig1"">FigureÂ 1</a> compares the distribution of <i>RP</i> gene transcript cycle threshold (<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) values (i.e., indication of host RNA recovered) for the nasal (<i>nâ</i>=â831 [88.2%]) and oral (<i>nâ</i>=â111 [11.8%]) samples. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) values were as follows: nasal swab, 23.3 (22.3 to 24.4), and oral swab, 25.1 (24.6 to 26.1). The 2 populations were significantly different (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.0001), with lower observed median <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values (i.e., more host RNA collected) for the nasal swab group. Additional results pertaining to the comparison of swab types are provided in the supplemental material.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>RT-qPCR measurement reliability.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Analysis of data from the study did not reveal any demonstrated false-negative or false-positive results from the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) measurements. The lower limit of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 <i>N</i> gene transcript fragment RT-qPCR assay was 10 RNA copies per reaction. All positive results were confirmed by retesting on multiple, successive occasions (see below). Any false-negative results would need to have been for asymptomatic individuals who did not infect other employees or household members. A probabilistic analysis on an employee with 12 consecutive false-negative results afforded a <i>P</i> valueâof &lt;0.000000001 (<i>P =</i> 1.81 Ã 10<sup>â24</sup>), assuming a 99% sensitivity and 95% specificity. If sensitivity analysis were to reduce the sensitivity and specificity to 0.90 for both, the upper probability bound over the same prevalence rates for 12 consecutive false-negative results is a <i>P</i>âvalue ofâ2.3 Ã 10<sup>â12</sup>. The probability bound for a participant to have 3 consecutive false-negative results calculated over a wide range of prevalence values (0.005 to 0.5) is a <i>P</i>âvalue of 0.0000114.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There were 5 invalid measurements in the first three study days attributed to lack of familiarity with the sampling protocol, and therefore, these were not included in the analysis. An additional 6 invalid samples were obtained during the remaining study period, accounting for 0.63% [6/(6 + 948)] of total measurements.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There were a total of 3 inconclusive measurements (0.32%) over the course of the study, with the following caveats: the inconclusive results did not include those obtained for the 2 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (see below), nor did they include 9 inconclusive results obtained on 2 study days (3 and 5 June) for participants who repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The high number of inconclusive measurements obtained on those 2 consecutive sampling days were attributed to reagent trace contaminants that resulted in erroneous, high <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value (i.e., low RNA copy number equivalent) background noise for amplicons obtained with the N1 or N2 primer.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Positive participant RT-qPCR results.</h3>

<div role=""paragraph"">In the participantâs clinical diary, subject 39 (age, over 50âyears; further demographics not disclosed for the purposes of confidentiality) described potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure on 12 March, with the onset of COVID-19 symptoms on 16 March that persisted until 31 March. During that period, the participant was self-isolated without hospitalization, and on 1 April, the participant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a clinical RT-qPCR (oral swab). On 11 April, the participant enrolled in our clinical study. The last nasal swab test that met the CDC criteria for a positive result was on 26 May, indicating that the participant was COVID-19 positive for at least 71âdays (16 March to 26 May). Oral (14 April) and stool (14 and 15 April) samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Subject 31 (age, over 50âyears; further demographics not disclosed for the purposes of confidentiality) is an employee who accessed the facility only once per week and therefore was tested weekly. The test results went from negative (up to 3 May) to positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (10 May) and remained positive for 14 days (until 24 May). The participant was asymptomatic during that period. Saliva (12, 13, 14, and 15 May) and stool (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 May) samples were either negative or inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Serological test results.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 33 serum samples collected between 27 March and 26 May 2020 were analyzed for virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations as described above. The results are summarized in <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>. Virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations in serum samples from subject 39 were measured for over 1 year (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). Other than subject 39, only one participant had detectable serum IgG concentrations (collected on 15 May; 0.12âÎ¼g ml<sup>â1</sup>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Model results of local study impacts.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The predictive model for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths described earlier was run for California with prevalence levels seen on 23 March 2020 and on 7 July 2020 in Los Angeles County. Given 27 employees and 27 household contacts with the demographic characteristics of the participants (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>) from the current study and without surveillance interventions, the model produced an expectation that up to 7 employees (95% confidence interval [CI]â=â3 to 10) would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization and 0 deaths. The lack of deaths stems from the population demographic tending toward younger persons and improved in-hospital treatment procedures at the time of writing.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Practical study considerations.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A number of policies and procedures were instituted during the study, as described below. Some were part of the original protocol, and others were added based on practical considerations. While working on site at Oak Crest, all individuals practiced social distancing and hand hygiene and wore face coverings when in close proximity to other employees on Mondays (see below); testing negated the need for mandatory face masks on other days. Outside of work, employees and their household members were encouraged to strictly adhere to current public health advisories regarding gathering in groups, wearing face coverings, and social distancing.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA received referrals for testing and recommendations (e.g., self-quarantine) based on the current, preferred public health requirements. Symptomatic participants, even if testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, would have been asked to return home (none were reported in the study), self-quarantine at a minimum until symptoms resolved, and contact their health care provider about confirmatory clinical testing and symptom management. Participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, even if asymptomatic, were informed as soon as possible and asked to go home, self-quarantine, and contact their health care provider or the Department of Public Health (DPH) about confirmatory testing, treatment, and quarantine recommendations. Participants also were given educational information to guide other household members of potential risk and some of their options. Any employee who was asked to self-quarantine, or did not choose to participate in the study, worked remotely as much as possible and continued to receive full pay.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Participants who tested negative and obtained a subsequent invalid test result were asked to wear protective face covering (surgical masks were provided by Oak Crest if needed) until they could be retested. Initially, participants who tested negative and obtained a subsequent inconclusive test result were sent home immediately and told to self-quarantine until they could be retested (i.e., new swab sample collected and analyzed). As the study progressed, that protocol was modified to be the same as for an invalid result (i.e., the employee was asked to wear protective face covering rather than being sent home for self-quarantine), assuming that previous test results were negative. The longest period between tests was Friday to the following Monday (3 days). Starting in May, all employees were required to wear protective masks on Monday mornings until the test results were finalized and communicated. The same procedure was instituted for 3-day weekends when there was an additional day between tests. Employees who missed 1 day of testing were required to wear a protective mask until they were retested. Employees who missed more than 1 day of testing were permitted to reenter the facility only after a new sample tested negative.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The current, ongoing clinical study has two primary aims: (i) to characterize the rate of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in a small cohort of participants interacting on a daily basis in the workplace and (ii) to determine the ability of these data to manage workplace SARS-CoV-2 exposure and consequences, minimizing further spread as per public health advisories. Workplace study participants include staff, students, and volunteer researchers, referred to as âemployees.â Family members and housemates also were recruited leading to a subcohort referred to as âhousehold members.â Related exploratory study goals include characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in employee and household members, quantifying antibody-specific responses in blood at baseline (previously exposed) and while on study (to capture asymptomatic/presymptomatic, newly infected individuals), and characterizing viral shedding parameters in saliva and stool samples.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Clinical SARS-CoV-2 RNA test kits are required to have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA and are processed in a laboratory certified according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Such kits have been a rare resource during this clinical study and, consequently, were not available for investigative purposes. Our clinical study used research reagents to achieve outcomes but did not interfere with the availability of reagents in short supply for clinical diagnosis. The RT and amplification kit (TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix) and primers have not been in short supply. The employed RNA extraction kit (Quick-RNA viral kit) did not have FDA EUA in March 2020 and has been readily available since then. Nasopharyngeal swabs were in short supply early in the study, requiring the use of existing, in-house stocks until they became more readily available starting in May 2020 (see <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> in the supplemental material). The various swab types performed similarly and met the study criteria. We analyzed approximately 1,000 samples over the course of the 3-month study, compared to over 37.2 million clinical tests reported for the United States over a similar period according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">The study was designed to be efficient in terms of manpower commitment and protecting the study team from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during sampling. Employees were trained in self-sample collection while isolated in their vehicles 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) between 8:30 and 9:15 a.m. with support from the study team. The samples (typically 23 to 28 per day) were processed the same day, with results available by early afternoon. A team of 4 researchers (2 handling samples and 2 observing for quality assurance [<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a>]) performed the RNA extraction and loading of the 96-well plate for RT and cDNA gene fragment amplification, typically completed within 90âmin. Additional labor included quality assurance and subsequent data analysis. These resource commitments made the study feasible to continue indefinitely until recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic allows for a safe workplace.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">During the course of the study, one employee (subject 31) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for ca. 2âweeks (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>). The viral RNA copy number (median, 13.1 copies per swab; IQR, 10.9 to 18.8 copies per swab) remained low throughout, and the subject did not report any COVID-19 symptoms. Blood draws on 14, 15, and 26 May from the subject produced serum samples that were below the analytical assay limit of detection (LLD) for 2 of the measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (IgM and IgG). However, anti-receptor binding domain protein (anti-RBD) IgA concentrations were detectable in all samples and decayed rapidly (half-life [<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>] = 1.3 days [<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>]).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">It is becoming increasingly evident based on literature reports that a significant proportion of individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results remain asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11 B12"">â</a><a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>) yet still contagious (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). However, ours is the first report on longitudinal analysis of an asymptomatic individual who maintained low SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and did not appear to trigger a traditional host immune response. This result is not entirely unexpected, as antibody responses are not detectable in all COVID-19 patients, especially those who experience low-grade symptoms (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">One household member (subject 39) was symptomatic and clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR and began participating in the study during convalescence after symptoms resolved (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a>). The subject developed a robust immune response in terms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA serum concentrations (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a> and <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) that persisted for over 1 year from the onset of symptoms, allowing decay half-lives for all three antibody types to be calculated. The intense longitudinal RNA sampling provided a rare insight into the viral dynamics of an individual recovering from COVID-19 over a 3-month time frame. Subject 39 remained positive for viral RNA for at least 71âdays, one of the longest periods of SARS-CoV-2 shedding reported at that time. Little is known about this potential subpopulation of individuals with persistent, long-term viral recalcitrance.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Intermittent news reports suggest that some convalescing COVID-19 patients who have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR may retest positive later in recovery, prompting speculation that some individuals are vulnerable to reinfection. Others hypothesize that positive retests are the result of noninfectious, residual viral fragments. Unfortunately, many of these reports are anecdotal and not scientifically controlled. Scientific studies on the alleged SARS-CoV-2 reinfection phenomenon are scarce. There are isolated case reports describing a situation in which a single COVID-19 patient was discharged, in part because of two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR clinical results, but retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA during convalescence (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16 B17 B18"">â</a><a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), including a 71-year-old woman who tested positive for 60âdays from the onset of symptoms (55âdays from her first positive test) (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). Other accounts detail similar results for small cohorts of 2 or more individuals (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). In a clinical study involving 66 patients who recovered from COVID-19, 11 (16.7%) retested positive for viral RNA in stool samples during convalescence (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). A cohort of 86 COVID-19 patients was retested by RT-qPCR less than 28âdays after self-reported symptom resolution. Eleven subjects (13%) were still diagnosed as positive by RT-qPCR at a median of 19âdays (range, 12 to 24âdays). An et al. followed 262 COVID-19 patients for 2âweeks following discharge and found that 14.5% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that this subset may be carriers of the virus (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). In a similar study, Huang et al. found that out of 414 recovering COVID-19 patients, discharged and subsequently quarantined, 69 (16.7%) retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 13 with 2 readmissions and 3 with 3 readmissions (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), suggesting that in some cases the virus was replication competent. The above-mentioned cases are distinct from so-called âlong-haul COVID,â in which patients who recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 continue to experience symptoms for long periods (&gt;100âdays) (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">All Oak Crest employees with the exception of subject 31 remained negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the 3-month study. In our hands, the RT-qPCR appeared to provide reliable results, with no known false positives or negatives. With the exception of subjects 31 and 39, inconclusive measurements (i.e., only one of the two oligonucleotide probes targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein gene transcript fragment met the assay threshold for positivity) made up a small fraction (0.32%) of the test results. We contend that in the context of a person developing or recovering from COVID-19 infection, inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements can define the transition phase between positive and negative, as supported by <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>. Keeping in mind data published regarding the potential reinfectivity of SARS-CoV-2, subjects 31 and 39 were continuously retested, even following occasions where subjects received 2 consecutive negative results. Scattered inconclusive results accompanying days of high <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values for subjects 31 and 39 provide insight into the potential for reinfection and speak to the sensitivity of our assay. This study is especially useful in distinguishing between cases that appear to be true reinfections and those that could be classified by the transition from a positive to a negative result.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Unexpectedly, 9 of 16 employees (56%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, mostly IgM, at baseline between 27 March and 3 April (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>), suggesting possible exposure to the virus prior to the start of the clinical study. Many of these participants reported suffering from symptoms consistent with COVID-19âthought to be a virulent flu strain at the timeâin the first half of February. However, none of these serum samples had detectable concentrations of IgG, which has the longest half-life of the three measured virus-specific antibodies (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). The findings remain unexplained and could be due to cross-reactivity in the IgM assay. Subject 18, a self-quarantined employee who had just recovered from suspected COVID-19 (based on symptomology) at the start of the study, repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but tested positive for IgM antibodies that rapidly declined (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 8.8 days [<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>]). No IgG or IgA antibodies were detected in serum samples from this participant.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There are some caveats to interpreting our antibody data. We measured only IgM, IgG, and IgA against RBD and not the whole spike or E proteins, as discussed in more detail elsewhere (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). The IgM assay is subject to greater uncertainty than the IgA and IgG assays at low concentrations (ca. 0.25âÎ¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> or lower), and results need to be interpreted with caution. However, all serum samples were analyzed at three levels of dilution (1:100, 1:40, and 1:20), and only detectable concentrations in at least 2 of the 3 diluted samples are reported.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical study described here has met its goals to date by providing a safe work environment for employees of a small academic institute, at a time when the United States was experiencing alarming expansion of the pandemic. The testing model constitutes a validated, practical framework that could be adopted by other small organizations for this and future respiratory virus pandemics. The ability to perform routine, frequent COVID-19 testing not only has allowed us to responsibly maintain a productive work environment during the pandemic but also has provided continuous reassuring data for the participating households, many including vulnerable individuals. This had the important mental health benefits of reducing anxiety and providing a sense of normalcy in the workplace (i.e., safe zone) during an acutely stressful period.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical studyâs success in preventing workplace SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be assessed through a predictive analysis. Modeling local study impacts predicted that without our intervention, up to 7 employees or household contacts could have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 7 July 2020. Our finding that only two subjects contracted COVID-19, one prior to the start of the study, suggests that workplace disease surveillance based on frequent, longitudinal testing combined with recommended public health practices (social distancing, frequent hand sanitizing, and mask wearing on selected days), when feasible, can be effective at creating a safe zone or bubble preventing COVID-19 from entering into the workplace.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our simulations predicted an important, local public health benefit from our scalable surveillance plan. Similar approaches were adopted subsequently in the summer of 2020 by professional sports leagues (e.g., the National Hockey League), the entertainment industry, and others to support responsible resumption of their activities. The study also generated important, new scientific data on the SARS-CoV-2 host dynamics enabled by its longitudinal, intense sampling design. Our clinical study represents a powerful example on how an innovative public health initiative can be dovetailed with scientific discovery.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-4-1""><h3>Ethics statement.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All human research under OCIS-05, âLongitudinal Characterization of COVID-19 Prevalence and Incidence in a Small Working Institution with Both Public Health and Diagnostic Aims,â was approved by the Aspire institutional review board (IRB) (Aspire study number 1281548) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All 54 study participants provided written informed consent or assent.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-2""><h3>Clinical study design.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical study was initiated on 23 March 2020 and is ongoing at the time of writing. Results from the first 3 months of testing (23 March 23 to 22 June 2020) are presented here. All employees, students, and volunteers at Oak Crest (<a href=""https://www.oak-crest.org/"">https://www.oak-crest.org/</a>), a small nonprofit academic science research organization located in Monrovia, CA, were asked to participate in the prospective, longitudinal, observational study designed to last 12âweeks, or longer. Those choosing not to participate had no negative employment or finance-related consequences but were asked to work from home exclusively. Household members from the above-described study population also were invited to participate in the study. At study onset, up to 30 Oak Crest employees and up to 60 household members were anticipated to participate. Additional details are provided in the supplemental material.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Test results for nasal or oral swabs collected in the morning typically were available early in the afternoon of the same day. When a participant tested positive or the results were inconclusive, testing was repeated for confirmation or performed at increased frequency (daily when feasible) until the participant had repeated negative results. Participants were advised in the informed consent and, again, when informed of research test results that these results were research based and not intended for clinical diagnosis. Participants received referrals for testing and recommendations (e.g., self-quarantine) based on the current, preferred public health requirements at the time.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Sample collection.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nasal sample collection was overseen by two researchers equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) in the Oak Crest parking lot, starting at 8:30 a.m. Typically, 30 samples or fewer were collected in under 45âmin. Additional details are provided in the supplemental material.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Under certain circumstances, study participants self-collected swab samples at home and placed the swab tip in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5âml) containing DNA/RNA Shield (300 Î¼l; Zymo Research, Tustin, CA). The samples were stored and transported at room temperature or 4Â°C and processed within 60 h. Control experiments showed that RNA integrity was maintained under these conditions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Optional saliva samples were self-collected in Falcon tubes (50âml) at the participantâs home or in their sealed vehicle, and stool swabs were collected at the participantâs home. Specific written instructions were provided to participants opting to provide these specimens. Blood (5 to 8âml, Ã2) was collected by a licensed phlebotomist using Vacutainer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) tubes for serum (spray-coated silica) and plasma (spray-coated K<sub>2</sub>EDTA) in the Oak Crest parking lot, while the participant remained comfortably seated in their vehicle.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-4""><h3>Chemicals and reagents.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise noted.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>RNA extraction.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">RNA was extracted from swab specimens in the collection tubes using the Quick-RNA viral kit (R1036; Zymo Research) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, consistent with the CDC COVID-19 testing kit guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). The kit is designed for the rapid isolation of high-quality RNA from a range of biological sources, including cellular suspensions.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3>RT-qPCR analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A one-step reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a 20-Î¼l final reaction volume per the manufacturerâs instructions. Three target sequences were amplified simultaneously (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) in accordance with CDC diagnostic COVID-19 testing guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>): two SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (<i>N</i>) gene transcript fragments (N1 and N2) and one human RNase P (<i>RP</i>) gene transcript fragment (RP). The primer/probe sequences are as described elsewhere (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>) and were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (10006606 and 10006713; Coralville, IA). RNA standards for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (<i>N</i>) was obtained from Microbiologics (HE0060-100-T; St. Cloud, MN) and served as positive controls. Confluent Caco-2 cells were used as a human specimen control (HSC) according to CDC guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Every panel consisted of one 96-well plate that accommodated 28 clinical specimens, each with three PCR probes (28âÃâ3â=â84 wells), HSC (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard as a positive control (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), and a no-template control (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), leaving 3 wells that were used for additional validation (e.g., naive swab).

<div role=""paragraph"">SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain protein (RBD) was produced by transient transfection of HEK-293F cells with plasmid pCAGGS (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>), containing the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike glycoprotein gene RBD with C-terminal hexahistidine tag (generously provided by F. Krammer). Transfection was carried utilizing the Expi293 expression system (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturerâs instructions. RBD was purified by affinity chromatography utilizing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RBD purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-12""><h3>(ii) ELISA for antibodies against RBD.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antibody responses against RBD were measured in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a protocol by Krammerâs group (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>) (see the supplemental material for more details).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-13""><h3>Model analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A COVID-19 infection model that combines traditional susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) compartmental models with Bayesian time series and modern machine learning was used for model analysis (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). This model fuses three methods to provide accurate predictions of case counts and hospitalizations. Briefly, a Bayesian time series model was fitted to the velocity (first derivative) of the cumulative case counts for each location, such as California, or a specific county, zip code, or even workplace and incorporated prior information such as local interventions to obtain the posterior distribution of the trajectory of the cases. This was then fed into the compartmental model to predict deaths using the random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics such as age, expected proportion of comorbidities, sex, and race/ethnicity. This yielded daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths for each location. The approach combined the strengths of traditional epidemiologic compartmental models with curve-fitting statistical models and modern machine learning.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-14""><h3>Data analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Data sets were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was defined as two-sided <i>Pâ</i>value of &lt;0.05. The unpaired, parametric, two-tailed <i>t</i> test was used to compare nasal and oral swab <i>RP</i> gene transcript <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values. Positivity only was defined from qPCR results, not by analysis of blood/serum samples, and hence, IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations are not included in probability estimates.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The probability of multiple, sequential false-negative SARS-CoV-2 results was estimated using traditional probability theory. Each serial test was assumed to be independent, as the probability of a test result outcome was not dependent on the result of the previous test. The sensitivity of the qPCR test was assumed to be 0.99 and the specificity 0.95 for nasal and oral swab samples. The probability of being COVD-19 positive given a negative test result was estimated according to Bayesâ theorem, <a href=""#FD2"">equation 2</a>:<div id=""FD2"" class=""display-formula"">

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated COVID-19 has precipitated a global pandemic heavily challenging our social behavior, economy, and health care infrastructure. In the absence of widespread, worldwide access to safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, public health measures represent a key intervention for curbing the devastating impacts from the pandemic. We are conducting an ongoing clinical study based on frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission among employees and their household members. Our study was successful in surveying the viral and immune response dynamics in two participants with unusual infections: one remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 71âdays, while the other was asymptomatic, with low associated viral RNA copy numbers. A COVID-19 infection model was used to predict that without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization, underscoring the importance of our program.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has precipitated a global pandemic heavily challenging our social behavior, economy, and health care infrastructure.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Worldwide, recovery from this active, devastating outbreak cannot begin until safe and effective medicines for treatment and prevention are available and accessible globally. In the interim, it is essential to use the rapidly expanding scientific knowledge on the novel SARS-CoV-2 to update guidelines for COVID-19 patient management as well as protection of the uninfected population. The implementation of social distancing, frequent and thorough hand washing, isolation, and the use of face coverings (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>) has helped curb the incidence of COVID-19 in many parts of the United States, and these measures continue to be important until high vaccination rates have been achieved. Our ability to design and introduce effective public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of the viral pathogenesis and dynamics, fundamental aspects of the disease that remain largely unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Workplace SARS-CoV-2 transmission is believed to represent an important contributor to the global COVID-19 pandemic, especially as countries attempt to spur economic activity (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). In a significant proportion of infected individuals, the disease manifests itself with mild or no symptoms (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>), and managing asymptomatic carriers, so-called âsilent spreaders,â represents a significant challenge in controlling the pandemic (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). This concern is heightened by findings suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates are similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Workplace transmission from SARS-CoV-2 carriers with mild or no symptoms therefore is a potentially important mode of spreading the highly communicable disease and represents a significant occupational health risk. Infected workers subsequently are susceptible to transmitting the virus further to household members. When workplace COVID-19 acquisition occurs, standard protective measures require all employees who have been in contact with the infected individual to self-quarantine for 2âweeks. This can effectively close units and businesses even though a proportion of the isolated workers may not have contracted the virus. Based on this rationale, the development and assessment of measures to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the workplace are highly significant and necessary to provide a safe occupational environment.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In a 15 May 2020 interview, James W. Curran, Dean, Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, stated, âAccurate surveillance is the conscience and guidepost for public healthâ (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The current clinical study builds on this foundational principle and consists of longitudinal and intensive characterization of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence at the Oak Crest Institute of Science (Oak Crest), a nonprofit science research organization in Southern California. The two primary study objectives were to (i) characterize the rate of COVID-19 acquisition in a small cohort of workers interacting on a daily basis in the workplace and (ii) determine the utility of these data in managing workplace COVID-19 exposure, minimizing further spread as per public health advisories. Exploratory aims include characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission between Oak Crest employees and their household members and measuring the viral dynamics in infected individuals from the study cohort.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Study participants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 54 subjects participated in the study over the first 3 months, 27 Oak Crest employees, students, and volunteers and 27 household members. Retention of study subjects was 100%. The corresponding demographics are presented in <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab1"" class=""table""></figure>
</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Sample collection efficiency.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The majority of clinical specimens consisted of nasal swab samples. Only 3 of the 54 participants (5.6%) could not tolerate the nasal swab procedure and self-collected oral samples instead. A total of 942 samples were analyzed in the 3-month study. <a href=""#fig1"">FigureÂ 1</a> compares the distribution of <i>RP</i> gene transcript cycle threshold (<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) values (i.e., indication of host RNA recovered) for the nasal (<i>nâ</i>=â831 [88.2%]) and oral (<i>nâ</i>=â111 [11.8%]) samples. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) values were as follows: nasal swab, 23.3 (22.3 to 24.4), and oral swab, 25.1 (24.6 to 26.1). The 2 populations were significantly different (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.0001), with lower observed median <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values (i.e., more host RNA collected) for the nasal swab group. Additional results pertaining to the comparison of swab types are provided in the supplemental material.</div>

<header></header><figure id=""fig1"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>RT-qPCR measurement reliability.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Analysis of data from the study did not reveal any demonstrated false-negative or false-positive results from the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) measurements. The lower limit of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 <i>N</i> gene transcript fragment RT-qPCR assay was 10 RNA copies per reaction. All positive results were confirmed by retesting on multiple, successive occasions (see below). Any false-negative results would need to have been for asymptomatic individuals who did not infect other employees or household members. A probabilistic analysis on an employee with 12 consecutive false-negative results afforded a <i>P</i> valueâof &lt;0.000000001 (<i>P =</i> 1.81 Ã 10<sup>â24</sup>), assuming a 99% sensitivity and 95% specificity. If sensitivity analysis were to reduce the sensitivity and specificity to 0.90 for both, the upper probability bound over the same prevalence rates for 12 consecutive false-negative results is a <i>P</i>âvalue ofâ2.3 Ã 10<sup>â12</sup>. The probability bound for a participant to have 3 consecutive false-negative results calculated over a wide range of prevalence values (0.005 to 0.5) is a <i>P</i>âvalue of 0.0000114.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There were 5 invalid measurements in the first three study days attributed to lack of familiarity with the sampling protocol, and therefore, these were not included in the analysis. An additional 6 invalid samples were obtained during the remaining study period, accounting for 0.63% [6/(6 + 948)] of total measurements.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There were a total of 3 inconclusive measurements (0.32%) over the course of the study, with the following caveats: the inconclusive results did not include those obtained for the 2 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (see below), nor did they include 9 inconclusive results obtained on 2 study days (3 and 5 June) for participants who repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The high number of inconclusive measurements obtained on those 2 consecutive sampling days were attributed to reagent trace contaminants that resulted in erroneous, high <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> value (i.e., low RNA copy number equivalent) background noise for amplicons obtained with the N1 or N2 primer.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Positive participant RT-qPCR results.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two participants were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the participantâs clinical diary, subject 39 (age, over 50âyears; further demographics not disclosed for the purposes of confidentiality) described potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure on 12 March, with the onset of COVID-19 symptoms on 16 March that persisted until 31 March. During that period, the participant was self-isolated without hospitalization, and on 1 April, the participant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a clinical RT-qPCR (oral swab). On 11 April, the participant enrolled in our clinical study. The last nasal swab test that met the CDC criteria for a positive result was on 26 May, indicating that the participant was COVID-19 positive for at least 71âdays (16 March to 26 May). Oral (14 April) and stool (14 and 15 April) samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Subject 31 (age, over 50âyears; further demographics not disclosed for the purposes of confidentiality) is an employee who accessed the facility only once per week and therefore was tested weekly. The test results went from negative (up to 3 May) to positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (10 May) and remained positive for 14 days (until 24 May). The participant was asymptomatic during that period. Saliva (12, 13, 14, and 15 May) and stool (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 May) samples were either negative or inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Serological test results.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 33 serum samples collected between 27 March and 26 May 2020 were analyzed for virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations as described above. The results are summarized in <a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>. Virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations in serum samples from subject 39 were measured for over 1 year (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). Other than subject 39, only one participant had detectable serum IgG concentrations (collected on 15 May; 0.12âÎ¼g ml<sup>â1</sup>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Model results of local study impacts.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The predictive model for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths described earlier was run for California with prevalence levels seen on 23 March 2020 and on 7 July 2020 in Los Angeles County. Given 27 employees and 27 household contacts with the demographic characteristics of the participants (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>) from the current study and without surveillance interventions, the model produced an expectation that up to 7 employees (95% confidence interval [CI]â=â3 to 10) would have become infected, with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalization and 0 deaths. The lack of deaths stems from the population demographic tending toward younger persons and improved in-hospital treatment procedures at the time of writing.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Practical study considerations.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A number of policies and procedures were instituted during the study, as described below. Some were part of the original protocol, and others were added based on practical considerations. While working on site at Oak Crest, all individuals practiced social distancing and hand hygiene and wore face coverings when in close proximity to other employees on Mondays (see below); testing negated the need for mandatory face masks on other days. Outside of work, employees and their household members were encouraged to strictly adhere to current public health advisories regarding gathering in groups, wearing face coverings, and social distancing.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA received referrals for testing and recommendations (e.g., self-quarantine) based on the current, preferred public health requirements. Symptomatic participants, even if testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, would have been asked to return home (none were reported in the study), self-quarantine at a minimum until symptoms resolved, and contact their health care provider about confirmatory clinical testing and symptom management. Participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, even if asymptomatic, were informed as soon as possible and asked to go home, self-quarantine, and contact their health care provider or the Department of Public Health (DPH) about confirmatory testing, treatment, and quarantine recommendations. Participants also were given educational information to guide other household members of potential risk and some of their options. Any employee who was asked to self-quarantine, or did not choose to participate in the study, worked remotely as much as possible and continued to receive full pay.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Participants who tested negative and obtained a subsequent invalid test result were asked to wear protective face covering (surgical masks were provided by Oak Crest if needed) until they could be retested. Initially, participants who tested negative and obtained a subsequent inconclusive test result were sent home immediately and told to self-quarantine until they could be retested (i.e., new swab sample collected and analyzed). As the study progressed, that protocol was modified to be the same as for an invalid result (i.e., the employee was asked to wear protective face covering rather than being sent home for self-quarantine), assuming that previous test results were negative. The longest period between tests was Friday to the following Monday (3 days). Starting in May, all employees were required to wear protective masks on Monday mornings until the test results were finalized and communicated. The same procedure was instituted for 3-day weekends when there was an additional day between tests. Employees who missed 1 day of testing were required to wear a protective mask until they were retested. Employees who missed more than 1 day of testing were permitted to reenter the facility only after a new sample tested negative.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The current, ongoing clinical study has two primary aims: (i) to characterize the rate of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in a small cohort of participants interacting on a daily basis in the workplace and (ii) to determine the ability of these data to manage workplace SARS-CoV-2 exposure and consequences, minimizing further spread as per public health advisories. Workplace study participants include staff, students, and volunteer researchers, referred to as âemployees.â Family members and housemates also were recruited leading to a subcohort referred to as âhousehold members.â Related exploratory study goals include characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in employee and household members, quantifying antibody-specific responses in blood at baseline (previously exposed) and while on study (to capture asymptomatic/presymptomatic, newly infected individuals), and characterizing viral shedding parameters in saliva and stool samples.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Clinical SARS-CoV-2 RNA test kits are required to have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA and are processed in a laboratory certified according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Such kits have been a rare resource during this clinical study and, consequently, were not available for investigative purposes. Our clinical study used research reagents to achieve outcomes but did not interfere with the availability of reagents in short supply for clinical diagnosis. The RT and amplification kit (TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix) and primers have not been in short supply. The employed RNA extraction kit (Quick-RNA viral kit) did not have FDA EUA in March 2020 and has been readily available since then. Nasopharyngeal swabs were in short supply early in the study, requiring the use of existing, in-house stocks until they became more readily available starting in May 2020 (see <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> in the supplemental material). The various swab types performed similarly and met the study criteria. We analyzed approximately 1,000 samples over the course of the 3-month study, compared to over 37.2 million clinical tests reported for the United States over a similar period according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>).</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">The study was designed to be efficient in terms of manpower commitment and protecting the study team from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during sampling. Employees were trained in self-sample collection while isolated in their vehicles 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) between 8:30 and 9:15 a.m. with support from the study team. The samples (typically 23 to 28 per day) were processed the same day, with results available by early afternoon. A team of 4 researchers (2 handling samples and 2 observing for quality assurance [<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a>]) performed the RNA extraction and loading of the 96-well plate for RT and cDNA gene fragment amplification, typically completed within 90âmin. Additional labor included quality assurance and subsequent data analysis. These resource commitments made the study feasible to continue indefinitely until recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic allows for a safe workplace.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">During the course of the study, one employee (subject 31) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for ca. 2âweeks (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>). The viral RNA copy number (median, 13.1 copies per swab; IQR, 10.9 to 18.8 copies per swab) remained low throughout, and the subject did not report any COVID-19 symptoms. Blood draws on 14, 15, and 26 May from the subject produced serum samples that were below the analytical assay limit of detection (LLD) for 2 of the measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (IgM and IgG). However, anti-receptor binding domain protein (anti-RBD) IgA concentrations were detectable in all samples and decayed rapidly (half-life [<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>] = 1.3 days [<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>]).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">It is becoming increasingly evident based on literature reports that a significant proportion of individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR results remain asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11 B12"">â</a><a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>) yet still contagious (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). However, ours is the first report on longitudinal analysis of an asymptomatic individual who maintained low SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and did not appear to trigger a traditional host immune response. This result is not entirely unexpected, as antibody responses are not detectable in all COVID-19 patients, especially those who experience low-grade symptoms (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">One household member (subject 39) was symptomatic and clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR and began participating in the study during convalescence after symptoms resolved (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a>). The subject developed a robust immune response in terms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA serum concentrations (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a> and <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) that persisted for over 1 year from the onset of symptoms, allowing decay half-lives for all three antibody types to be calculated. The intense longitudinal RNA sampling provided a rare insight into the viral dynamics of an individual recovering from COVID-19 over a 3-month time frame. Subject 39 remained positive for viral RNA for at least 71âdays, one of the longest periods of SARS-CoV-2 shedding reported at that time. Little is known about this potential subpopulation of individuals with persistent, long-term viral recalcitrance.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Intermittent news reports suggest that some convalescing COVID-19 patients who have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR may retest positive later in recovery, prompting speculation that some individuals are vulnerable to reinfection. Others hypothesize that positive retests are the result of noninfectious, residual viral fragments. Unfortunately, many of these reports are anecdotal and not scientifically controlled. Scientific studies on the alleged SARS-CoV-2 reinfection phenomenon are scarce. There are isolated case reports describing a situation in which a single COVID-19 patient was discharged, in part because of two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR clinical results, but retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA during convalescence (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16 B17 B18"">â</a><a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>), including a 71-year-old woman who tested positive for 60âdays from the onset of symptoms (55âdays from her first positive test) (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). Other accounts detail similar results for small cohorts of 2 or more individuals (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). In a clinical study involving 66 patients who recovered from COVID-19, 11 (16.7%) retested positive for viral RNA in stool samples during convalescence (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). A cohort of 86 COVID-19 patients was retested by RT-qPCR less than 28âdays after self-reported symptom resolution. Eleven subjects (13%) were still diagnosed as positive by RT-qPCR at a median of 19âdays (range, 12 to 24âdays). An et al. followed 262 COVID-19 patients for 2âweeks following discharge and found that 14.5% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that this subset may be carriers of the virus (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). In a similar study, Huang et al. found that out of 414 recovering COVID-19 patients, discharged and subsequently quarantined, 69 (16.7%) retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 13 with 2 readmissions and 3 with 3 readmissions (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>), suggesting that in some cases the virus was replication competent. The above-mentioned cases are distinct from so-called âlong-haul COVID,â in which patients who recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 continue to experience symptoms for long periods (&gt;100âdays) (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">All Oak Crest employees with the exception of subject 31 remained negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the 3-month study. In our hands, the RT-qPCR appeared to provide reliable results, with no known false positives or negatives. With the exception of subjects 31 and 39, inconclusive measurements (i.e., only one of the two oligonucleotide probes targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein gene transcript fragment met the assay threshold for positivity) made up a small fraction (0.32%) of the test results. We contend that in the context of a person developing or recovering from COVID-19 infection, inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements can define the transition phase between positive and negative, as supported by <a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>. Keeping in mind data published regarding the potential reinfectivity of SARS-CoV-2, subjects 31 and 39 were continuously retested, even following occasions where subjects received 2 consecutive negative results. Scattered inconclusive results accompanying days of high <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values for subjects 31 and 39 provide insight into the potential for reinfection and speak to the sensitivity of our assay. This study is especially useful in distinguishing between cases that appear to be true reinfections and those that could be classified by the transition from a positive to a negative result.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Unexpectedly, 9 of 16 employees (56%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, mostly IgM, at baseline between 27 March and 3 April (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>), suggesting possible exposure to the virus prior to the start of the clinical study. Many of these participants reported suffering from symptoms consistent with COVID-19âthought to be a virulent flu strain at the timeâin the first half of February. However, none of these serum samples had detectable concentrations of IgG, which has the longest half-life of the three measured virus-specific antibodies (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). The findings remain unexplained and could be due to cross-reactivity in the IgM assay. Subject 18, a self-quarantined employee who had just recovered from suspected COVID-19 (based on symptomology) at the start of the study, repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but tested positive for IgM antibodies that rapidly declined (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 8.8 days [<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>]). No IgG or IgA antibodies were detected in serum samples from this participant.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There are some caveats to interpreting our antibody data. We measured only IgM, IgG, and IgA against RBD and not the whole spike or E proteins, as discussed in more detail elsewhere (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). The IgM assay is subject to greater uncertainty than the IgA and IgG assays at low concentrations (ca. 0.25âÎ¼g ml<sup>â1</sup> or lower), and results need to be interpreted with caution. However, all serum samples were analyzed at three levels of dilution (1:100, 1:40, and 1:20), and only detectable concentrations in at least 2 of the 3 diluted samples are reported.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical study described here has met its goals to date by providing a safe work environment for employees of a small academic institute, at a time when the United States was experiencing alarming expansion of the pandemic. The testing model constitutes a validated, practical framework that could be adopted by other small organizations for this and future respiratory virus pandemics. The ability to perform routine, frequent COVID-19 testing not only has allowed us to responsibly maintain a productive work environment during the pandemic but also has provided continuous reassuring data for the participating households, many including vulnerable individuals. This had the important mental health benefits of reducing anxiety and providing a sense of normalcy in the workplace (i.e., safe zone) during an acutely stressful period.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical studyâs success in preventing workplace SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be assessed through a predictive analysis. Modeling local study impacts predicted that without our intervention, up to 7 employees or household contacts could have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 7 July 2020. Our finding that only two subjects contracted COVID-19, one prior to the start of the study, suggests that workplace disease surveillance based on frequent, longitudinal testing combined with recommended public health practices (social distancing, frequent hand sanitizing, and mask wearing on selected days), when feasible, can be effective at creating a safe zone or bubble preventing COVID-19 from entering into the workplace.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our simulations predicted an important, local public health benefit from our scalable surveillance plan. Similar approaches were adopted subsequently in the summer of 2020 by professional sports leagues (e.g., the National Hockey League), the entertainment industry, and others to support responsible resumption of their activities. The study also generated important, new scientific data on the SARS-CoV-2 host dynamics enabled by its longitudinal, intense sampling design. Our clinical study represents a powerful example on how an innovative public health initiative can be dovetailed with scientific discovery.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-4-1""><h3>Ethics statement.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All human research under OCIS-05, âLongitudinal Characterization of COVID-19 Prevalence and Incidence in a Small Working Institution with Both Public Health and Diagnostic Aims,â was approved by the Aspire institutional review board (IRB) (Aspire study number 1281548) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All 54 study participants provided written informed consent or assent.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-2""><h3>Clinical study design.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The clinical study was initiated on 23 March 2020 and is ongoing at the time of writing. Results from the first 3 months of testing (23 March 23 to 22 June 2020) are presented here. All employees, students, and volunteers at Oak Crest (<a href=""https://www.oak-crest.org/"">https://www.oak-crest.org/</a>), a small nonprofit academic science research organization located in Monrovia, CA, were asked to participate in the prospective, longitudinal, observational study designed to last 12âweeks, or longer. Those choosing not to participate had no negative employment or finance-related consequences but were asked to work from home exclusively. Household members from the above-described study population also were invited to participate in the study. At study onset, up to 30 Oak Crest employees and up to 60 household members were anticipated to participate. Additional details are provided in the supplemental material.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Test results for nasal or oral swabs collected in the morning typically were available early in the afternoon of the same day. When a participant tested positive or the results were inconclusive, testing was repeated for confirmation or performed at increased frequency (daily when feasible) until the participant had repeated negative results. Participants were advised in the informed consent and, again, when informed of research test results that these results were research based and not intended for clinical diagnosis. Participants received referrals for testing and recommendations (e.g., self-quarantine) based on the current, preferred public health requirements at the time.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Sample collection.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Nasal sample collection was overseen by two researchers equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) in the Oak Crest parking lot, starting at 8:30 a.m. Typically, 30 samples or fewer were collected in under 45âmin. Additional details are provided in the supplemental material.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Under certain circumstances, study participants self-collected swab samples at home and placed the swab tip in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5âml) containing DNA/RNA Shield (300 Î¼l; Zymo Research, Tustin, CA). The samples were stored and transported at room temperature or 4Â°C and processed within 60 h. Control experiments showed that RNA integrity was maintained under these conditions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Optional saliva samples were self-collected in Falcon tubes (50âml) at the participantâs home or in their sealed vehicle, and stool swabs were collected at the participantâs home. Specific written instructions were provided to participants opting to provide these specimens. Blood (5 to 8âml, Ã2) was collected by a licensed phlebotomist using Vacutainer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) tubes for serum (spray-coated silica) and plasma (spray-coated K<sub>2</sub>EDTA) in the Oak Crest parking lot, while the participant remained comfortably seated in their vehicle.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-4""><h3>Chemicals and reagents.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise noted.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3>RNA extraction.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">RNA was extracted from swab specimens in the collection tubes using the Quick-RNA viral kit (R1036; Zymo Research) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, consistent with the CDC COVID-19 testing kit guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). The kit is designed for the rapid isolation of high-quality RNA from a range of biological sources, including cellular suspensions.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3>RT-qPCR analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A one-step reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in a 20-Î¼l final reaction volume per the manufacturerâs instructions. Three target sequences were amplified simultaneously (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) in accordance with CDC diagnostic COVID-19 testing guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>): two SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (<i>N</i>) gene transcript fragments (N1 and N2) and one human RNase P (<i>RP</i>) gene transcript fragment (RP). The primer/probe sequences are as described elsewhere (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>) and were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (10006606 and 10006713; Coralville, IA). RNA standards for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (<i>N</i>) was obtained from Microbiologics (HE0060-100-T; St. Cloud, MN) and served as positive controls. Confluent Caco-2 cells were used as a human specimen control (HSC) according to CDC guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Every panel consisted of one 96-well plate that accommodated 28 clinical specimens, each with three PCR probes (28âÃâ3â=â84 wells), HSC (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard as a positive control (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), and a no-template control (1âÃâ3â=â3 wells), leaving 3 wells that were used for additional validation (e.g., naive swab). This panel configuration meets or exceeds the CDC guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Ninety-six-well PCR plates were prepared using reagents on ice and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 1âmin at room temperature. The plates were run on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) using the following cycling conditions: stage 1, 25Â°C for 2âmin (1âcycle); stage 2, 50Â°C for 15âmin (1âcycle); stage 3, 95Â°C for 2âmin (1âcycle); stage 4, step 1, 95Â°C for 3 s, and step 2, 55Â°C for 30 s, with a loop of 45 cycles of steps 1 and 2 (total, 46 cycles per assay). Stages 1 and 2 were reverse transcription, stage 3 was inactivation, and stage 4 was amplification.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number, Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> was calculated according to <a href=""#FD1"">equation 1</a>:<div id=""FD1"" class=""display-formula"">

<div role=""paragraph"">Calibration plots of <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> versus RNA copy number were generated for every batch of TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix kits. Predetermined amounts of RNA standard for SARS-CoV-2 <i>N</i> gene transcript fragments (see above) were serially diluted in nuclease-free water (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). In a typical experiment, eight calibration standards were used, spanning the RNA copy number range from 0.15 to 1.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>. The samples (20 Î¼l) were analyzed (N1 and N2 probes) as described above.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-8""><h3>Assay result interpretation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The diagnostic panel result interpretation followed CDC guidelines (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Specimens with a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> less than 40 for N1, N2, and RP were considered positive. Samples with a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> greater than 40 for N1 and N2 but less than 40 for RP were considered negative. Samples with a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> for either N1 or N2 less than 40 (i.e., only one of the two probes resulted in a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> less than 40) and a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> for RP less than 40 were considered inconclusive. Samples with a <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> for RP greater than 40 were considered invalid.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-9""><h3>Swab assessment.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A range of collection swabs were used in the clinical study due to supply shortages (see Results).

<div role=""paragraph"">SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain protein (RBD) was produced by transient transfection of HEK-293F cells with plasmid pCAGGS (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>), containing the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike glycoprotein gene RBD with C-terminal hexahistidine tag (generously provided by F. Krammer). Transfection was carried utilizing the Expi293 expression system (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturerâs instructions. RBD was purified by affinity chromatography utilizing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RBD purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-12""><h3>(ii) ELISA for antibodies against RBD.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antibody responses against RBD were measured in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a protocol by Krammerâs group (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>) (see the supplemental material for more details).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-13""><h3>Model analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A COVID-19 infection model that combines traditional susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) compartmental models with Bayesian time series and modern machine learning was used for model analysis (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). This model fuses three methods to provide accurate predictions of case counts and hospitalizations. Briefly, a Bayesian time series model was fitted to the velocity (first derivative) of the cumulative case counts for each location, such as California, or a specific county, zip code, or even workplace and incorporated prior information such as local interventions to obtain the posterior distribution of the trajectory of the cases. This was then fed into the compartmental model to predict deaths using the random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics such as age, expected proportion of comorbidities, sex, and race/ethnicity. This yielded daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths for each location. The approach combined the strengths of traditional epidemiologic compartmental models with curve-fitting statistical models and modern machine learning.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-14""><h3>Data analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Data sets were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3; GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was defined as two-sided <i>Pâ</i>value of &lt;0.05. The unpaired, parametric, two-tailed <i>t</i> test was used to compare nasal and oral swab <i>RP</i> gene transcript <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values. Positivity only was defined from qPCR results, not by analysis of blood/serum samples, and hence, IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations are not included in probability estimates.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The probability of multiple, sequential false-negative SARS-CoV-2 results was estimated using traditional probability theory. Each serial test was assumed to be independent, as the probability of a test result outcome was not dependent on the result of the previous test. The sensitivity of the qPCR test was assumed to be 0.99 and the specificity 0.95 for nasal and oral swab samples. The probability of being COVD-19 positive given a negative test result was estimated according to Bayesâ theorem, <a href=""#FD2"">equation 2</a>:<div id=""FD2"" class=""display-formula"">

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00186-20","<div role=""paragraph"">Lassa virus (LASV) poses a significant public health problem within the regions of Lassa fever endemicity in Western Africa. LASV infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly, and a considerable number of Lassa fever cases are associated with high morbidity and lethality. No approved LASV vaccine is available, and current therapy is limited to an off-label usage of ribavirin that is only partially effective and associated with significant side effects. The impact of Lassa fever on human health, together with the limited existing countermeasures, highlights the importance of developing effective vaccines against LASV. Here, we present the development and characterization of a recombinant LASV (rLASV) vaccine candidate [rLASV(IGR/S-S)], which is based on the presence of the noncoding intergenic region (IGR) of the small (S) genome segment (S-IGR) in both large (L) and S LASV segments. In cultured cells, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was modestly less fit than wild-type rLASV (rLASV-WT). rLASV(IGR/S-S) was highly attenuated in guinea pigs, and a single subcutaneous low dose of the virus completely protected against otherwise lethal infection with LASV-WT. Moreover, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was genetically stable during serial passages in cultured cells. These findings indicate that rLASV(IGR/S-S) can be developed into a LASV live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) that has the same antigenic composition as LASV-WT and a well-defined mechanism of attenuation that overcomes concerns about increased virulence that could be caused by genetic changes in the LAV during multiple rounds of multiplication.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Lassa fever (LF) was first described in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969 (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The causative agent of LF, Lassa virus (LASV), was subsequently discovered and isolated from LF patients and its natural host reservoir, the Natal mastomys (<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mastomys natalensis</span>) (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). LF poses a significant public health burden in the areas where it is endemic, mainly sub-Saharan Western Africa (e.g., Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone). A single longitudinal study conducted more than 30âyears ago in Sierra Leone estimated that hundreds of thousands of LASV infections occurred annually (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Among the people infected, 80% are asymptomatic, whereas the other 20% develop disease that usually requires hospital admission. Nevertheless, LASV infection was largely ignored as a public health threat for extended periods of time (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), and the true incidence of LASV infections and the public health burden of LF in Western Africa remain unknown but are likely significant. Case fatality rates (CFRs) of 15% to 20% have been reported among hospitalized LF patients (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). Recently, the occurrence of a high number of LF cases associated with high (up to 60%) case fatality rates in Nigeria (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>, <a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>) triggered reevaluation of LF risk for global health security (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). Moreover, LASV expansion outside its traditional areas of endemicity and increased travel have resulted in exportation of LF cases from Western African countries where the disease is endemic to countries where it is nonendemic (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). To date, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed countermeasures are available to prevent or treat LASV, and current anti-LASV therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Due to the impact of LF on human health and limited existing countermeasures to combat LF, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LF on the revised list of priority diseases for development of effective vaccines (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Like other mammarenaviruses (<i>Bunyavirales</i>: <i>Arenaviridae</i>), LASV is an enveloped virus with a bisegmented, single-stranded RNA genome (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Each viral genome segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two viral proteins from open reading frames separated by noncoding intergenic regions (IGRs) (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). The large (L) segment encodes the large (L) protein that functions as a viral RNA (vRNA)-directed RNA polymerase and RING finger protein Z, which functions as a matrix-like protein for virion assembly and budding (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16 B17"">â</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). The small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP) precursor (GPC) (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a><a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">â</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). NP and L, together with the vRNA, form the viral L and S ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) responsible for directing replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome. NP is also involved in counteracting innate immune responses during viral infection (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23 B24"">â</a><a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). GPC is cotranslationally processed by cellular signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide (SSP) and a GPC precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved by the cellular proprotein convertase and subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) to generate GP1 and GP2 subunits. The GP1 and GP2 subunits, together with the SSP, form mature GP peplomers on the surface of the virion envelope that mediate virion cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">â</a><a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For a given mammarenavirus, S-IGRs and L-IGRs differ in both sequence and predicted secondary structures. The IGRs play critical roles in mammarenavirus transcriptional control and production of infectious particles (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). The L-IGR and S-IGR of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) have distinct functional roles in posttranscriptional control of viral gene expression (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). The importance of the IGRs in viral multiplication has also been documented for other arenaviruses. For instance, replication of a recombinant Lujo virus with a 36-nucleotide deletion in the L-IGR was impaired in cultured cells compared to its parental virus (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). A Machupo virus with a 35-nucleotide deletion within the L-IGR was only moderately less fit in cell culture than the wild-type (WT) virus but highly attenuated <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Importantly, a recombinant LCMV containing the S-IGR in both the S and L genome segments [rLCMV(IGR/S-S)] was only modestly less fit in cultured cells than rLCMV-WT. However, rLCMV(IGR/S-S) was highly attenuated in a laboratory mouse model of LCMV infection, but mice immunized with rLCMV(IGR/S-S) were fully protected against an otherwise lethal infection with rLCMV-WT (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">On the basis of these promising results, we examined whether reorganization of IGRs could represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation that could be applied to LASV. In line with prospective epidemiological studies in Western Africa, live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) represent the most feasible approach to control LF, as LAVs induce long-term robust cell-mediated responses following single immunizations (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Here, we report the generation of a recombinant LASV that contains the LASV S-IGR in both the S and L genome segments, rLASV(IGR/S-S). <i>In vitro</i>, the viral fitness of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was moderately decreased compared to rLASV-WT. <i>In vivo</i>, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was fully attenuated in both strain 13 and Hartley guinea pigs but provided full protection, upon a single subcutaneous (s.c.) low-dose administration, against an otherwise lethal exposure to LASV-WT. Our data support further development of this strategy as a general mechanism for the development of LAVs to combat human mammarenavirus infections.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Generation of rLASV(IGR/S-S).</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">LASV L- and S-IGRs are different in both sequence and predicted structure (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). A previously established LASV mouse RNA polymerase I promoter-based reverse genetic system was used to generate a recombinant LASV containing the S-IGR in both L and S segments [rLASV(IGR/S-S)] (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>) (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). However, several attempts to rescue rLASV(IGR/S-S) were unsuccessful. As an alternative approach, we used a LASV reverse genetic system in which intracellular synthesis of L and S segment vRNAs was under the control of the Escherichia phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). HEK293T/17 cells were transfected with the indicated set of five plasmids (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). On day 6âposttransfection (p.t.), tissue culture supernatants (TCS) (P0D6) were collected, and transfected HEK293T/17 cells were cocultured with fresh Vero cells. After days 10 (day 4 of coculture [P0D10]), 13 (day 7 of coculture [P0D13]), and 17 (day 11 of coculture [P0D17]) p.t., TCS were collected, and viral titers in TCS were determined for all four time points by plaque assay (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a>). At day 6âp.t., unlike rLASV-WT, infectious rLASV(IGR/S-S) was not detected in TCS. However, in cocultures of transfected HEK293T/17 with Vero cells, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was recovered at a low titer (1.5âÃâ10<sup>3</sup> PFU/ml) followed by an increased titer seen after transfer to fresh Vero cells (4.83âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> PFU/ml at P0D13) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Characterization of rLASV(IGR/S-S).</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">rLASV-WT and rLASV(IGR/S-S) growth kinetics were compared by inoculating interferon (IFN)-competent (A549) and IFN-deficient (Vero) cells with these viruses at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). Viral titers were measured daily for 4âdays postexposure (p.e.). rLASV(IGR/S-S) replicated efficiently in both cell types, although viral peak titers in both cell lines were up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of rLASV-WT (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">B</a>). The plaque sizes produced by rLASV(IGR/S-S) (0.60âÂ±â0.21âmm in diameter) were significantly smaller than those caused by rLASV-WT (2.12âÂ±â0.74âmm; <i>n</i>â=â25, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.0001) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2C</a>). Viral spread was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay in A549 and Vero cells infected with rLASV-WT or rLASV(IGR/S-S). Both GP-positive and NP-positive cell numbers were lower in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-infected cells than in rLASV-WT-infected cells at 48âh and 72âh p.e. (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2D</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">E</a>; see also <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Reduced GP and NP expression was also observed in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-infected A549 cells by Western blotting (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2F</a>). Taking the results together, the reorganization of IGR in LASV genome modestly reduced fitness in cultured cells.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Next, we examined whether replacement of L-IGR with S-IGR in the L segment would have an appreciable impact on LASV virulence <i>in vivo</i>. Since strain 13 guinea pigs are highly sensitive to LASV infection, with 100% lethality following s.c. exposure to 10<sup>3</sup> PFU (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), the safety profile of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was evaluated in strain 13 guinea pigs.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Strain 13 guinea pigs were inoculated s.c. with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<i>n</i>â=â5), rLASV-WT (<i>n</i>â=â4), or LASV (<i>n</i>â=â5). All animals inoculated with rLASV(IGR/S-S) survived to the end of the study (day 42 p.e.) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>) without developing any overt clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>), including weight loss (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>) or elevated temperature (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3D</a>). In contrast, all animals inoculated with rLASV-WT or LASV developed several clinical signs of infection (e.g., ruffled coat, labored respiration), body weight loss, and transient elevated temperatures (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>, <a href=""#fig3"">C</a>, and <a href=""#fig3"">D</a>, respectively). Two of 4 rLASV-WT-exposed and 4 of 5 LASV-exposed guinea pigs eventually met euthanasia criteria. Viral loads in blood at the different times p.e. (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>) and in the indicated tissues at the end of the study (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>) were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). vRNAs were not detected in the blood collected at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 p.e. from the majority of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs. Low concentrations of viral RNA (9.32âÃâ10<sup>3</sup> vRNA copies/ml) were detected at day 7 p.e. from one rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pig (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>). In contrast, in rLASV-WT-exposed or LASV-exposed guinea pigs, high concentrations of vRNAs were detected in blood samples collected at day 7 and day 14 p.e. (average 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> LASV vRNA copies/ml) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>). As with the blood samples, vRNAs were not detected in tissues collected from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs at the experimental endpoint (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>). In contrast, vRNAs were detected in most tissues tested from rLASV-WT-inoculated or LASV-inoculated animals (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>). Anti-LASV IgG plasma titers determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3G</a>) were detected in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs, suggesting that they were infected with rLASV(IGR/S-S). No anti-LASV neutralization antibody (nAb) titer was detected in the sera of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs at the study endpoint (data not shown).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Significant histopathological lesions were not observed in the examined tissues of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>), and all examined tissues from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs were negative for LASV antigen (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). In contrast, typical acute LF lesions, including those resulting from interstitial pneumonia (data not shown), hepatic degeneration and necrosis (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>, white arrow), endocarditis (data not shown), and splenic lymphoid depletion (data not shown), were observed in all guinea pigs that succumbed to rLASV-WT or LASV infection. Positive LASV antigen staining was observed mainly in macrophages, epithelial cells, and/or arterial endothelial cells. Consistent with previous findings (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), mild to moderate systemic, lymphoplasmacytic, and histiocytic perivasculitis (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>, black arrow) was observed in guinea pigs that survived rLASV-WT or LASV infection. Positive LASV antigen staining was noted in the smooth muscle cells in the tunicae mediae of large renal arteries (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>). Overall, these results demonstrated the attenuation of rLASV(IGR/S-S) in strain 13 guinea pigs.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">To test whether a single dose of rLASV(IGR/S-S) could provide protection to strain 13 guinea pigs against a typically lethal LASV exposure, strain 13 guinea pigs were immunized with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) s.c. (<i>n</i>â=â4) or with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as an immunization control (<i>n</i>â=â5) (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5</a>). At 30âdays postimmunization (p.i.), these guinea pigs were exposed to 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of LASV s.c., and animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection throughout the study. Like the previous observation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>), guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) did not develop any clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2A</a>) or of abnormal weight loss (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2B</a>), although transient elevated temperatures were observed from day 8 p.i. (day â22 p.e.) to day 13 p.i. (day â17 p.e.) (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2C</a>). All rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs survived the typically lethal exposure to LASV (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>) without developing any clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>), weight loss (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>), or elevated temperatures (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). In contrast, all mock-immunized guinea pigs developed classic disease signs of LASV infection (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>), began losing weight at day 8 p.e. (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>), and had elevated (&gt;40Â°C) temperatures at day 9 p.e. (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). In the mock-immunization group, 3 of 5 guinea pigs succumbed to LASV infection on days 15 to 16 p.e., one guinea pig developed mild to moderate clinical signs until the study endpoint, and one guinea pig had mild clinical signs and recovered from infection (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a> and <a href=""#fig5"">B</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Next, a low dose of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was evaluated for efficacy to protect against LASV infection. Hartley (outbred) guinea pigs are less sensitive than strain 13 (inbred) guinea pigs to LASV infection, with 30% lethality following s.c. administration of 2.4âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> PFU (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). However, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of guinea pig-adapted LASV isolate Josiah (GPA-LASV) in Hartley guinea pigs results in â¥80% lethality (reference <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a> and unpublished data). Given the limited availability of strain 13 guinea pigs, the Hartley model is attractive for testing the efficacy of LASV therapeutic and vaccine candidates (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). We immunized three groups of Hartley guinea pigs s.c. with 10<sup>2</sup> PFU (low dose, <i>n</i>â=â8) or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU (high dose, <i>n</i>â=â8) of rLASV(IGR/S-S) or with PBS (<i>n</i>â=â7). Hartley guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) did not develop any clinical signs of disease from immunization alone (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a>), including abnormal weight loss (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>), although transient elevated temperatures were observed in several rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized animals (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6C</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">At 30âdays postimmunization (p.i.), all immunized guinea pigs were exposed to a typically lethal dose of GPA-LASV (10<sup>4</sup> PFU) i.p. and monitored daily for clinical signs of infection, including body weight and temperature changes, throughout the study. All guinea pigs immunized with either 10<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) were protected against GPA-LASV-associated disease without having any clinical signs of disease [<i>Pâ=â</i>0.0442 for both doses of rLASV(IGR/S-S)] (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a> to <a href=""#fig7"">D</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">Viremia was assessed by RT-qPCR on days â16 and â2 preexposure [days 14 and 28 after rLASV(IGR/S-S) immunization]. At day â16 preexposure (day 14 p.i.), vRNAs were detected in 3 of 8 and 2 of 8 animals that were immunized with 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLASV-IGR(S-S), respectively. At day â2 preexposure (day 28 p.i.), vRNAs were not detected in blood of any of the rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized animals (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7E</a>). Importantly, at day 12 after GPA-LASV exposure, vRNAs were detected in all mock-immunized guinea pigs (average 10<sup>7</sup> vRNA copies/ml) but not in any rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized animals (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7E</a>). Likewise, high vRNA loads were detected in most of the tissues collected from mock-immunized animals that had succumbed to GPA-LASV infection (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, red). vRNAs were also detected in different tissues collected from mock-immunized animals that had recovered from GPA-LASV infection (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, orange). However, vRNAs were not detected in most tissues from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs. The exception was a very low concentration of vRNAs (9.3âÃâ10 vRNA copies/mg tissue, i.e., below the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ]) that was detected in the spleen of one guinea pig that had been immunized with 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, blue and green). No significant histopathological lesions or positive LASV antigen staining was detected in the tissues from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs (data not shown).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Anti-LASV IgG titers were detected in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs 2âweeks p.i.

Anti-LASV neutralizing antibodies were detected in the serum of 8 of 16 guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) and exposed to GPA-LASV, suggesting that neutralization antibodies do not play an important role in the protection provided by rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7H</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Hartley guinea pigs were completely protected from LASV infection after a single administration of a low rLASV(IGR/S-S) dose.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>rLASV(IGR/S-S) is genetically stable during serial passages in cultured cells.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To develop any LAV, evaluation of the genetic stability of LAV during multiplication in infected cells is critical. Therefore, the genetic stability of rLASV(IGR/S-S) <i>in vitro</i> was investigated by serial passaging in Vero cells. To that end, Vero cells were inoculated (MOIâ=â0.01) with rLASV(IGR/S-S) and at 72 h p.e., TCS were collected (passage 1 [P1]), and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Fresh Vero cells were inoculated (MOIâ=â0.01) with rLASV(IGR/S-S) P1, and this process was serially repeated for a total of 15 passages (P15). Endpoint titers of each passage were in the range from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8A</a>). The full-length viral genome sequences collected at P1, P5, P10, and P15 were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with frequencies greater than 20% were recorded (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8B</a>). All SNPs detected within the S-IGR sequence in the L segment remained at a low level (2.33% Â± 1.95) during serial passages in Vero cells. Several mutations occurred in the remainder of the L segment (e.g., T1856C, T2023C, and T4241A) and in the S segment (e.g., C1915T), which undulated in frequency during passages, suggesting that these mutations may not confer significant selective advantages. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), A1691T, accumulated in the S segment during P10 to P15. At P15, SNPs T239A (Y62F) in the GPC gene of the S segment and T5350A (K580N) in the L gene were present at low frequency. To test the impact of these SNPs on viral fitness, the growth kinetics of rLASV(IGR/S-S) in Vero cells at an MOI of 0.01 were compared at P0, P5, P10, and P15. rLASV(IGR/S-S) from these passages had similar growth kinetics in Vero cells, and the viral peak titers were not statistically significantly different (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the mutations described above did not impact viral fitness in cell culture (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8C</a>). These results demonstrate that rLASV(IGR/S-S) was genetically stable up to 15 passages in Vero cells.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Fifty years after its first description, LF still poses a major public health burden in the regions where it is endemic in Western Africa. The recent LF outbreaks in Nigeria (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), together with the lack of licensed medical countermeasures to combat LASV infection, underscore the urgent need for LASV vaccine development (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Epidemiological studies and nonhuman primate studies provided evidence supporting the concept that LASV-specific cell-mediated immune responses are associated with effective control of virus replication and subsequent recovery (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Although passive transfer of a cocktail of engineered human neutralization antibodies (nAbs) provided protective efficacy in LASV animal models (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a><a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">â</a><a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), LASV nAbs appeared at low titers in convalescing patients several months after initial infection (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). These discrepant results indicate that nAbs probably do not contribute to viral control and recovery from acute infection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Following a single immunization, LAVs often induce long-term robust cell-mediated and humoral immune response (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>) and represent the most feasible and attractive approach to combat LF within areas of endemicity. Several LF vaccine platforms based on recombinant viral vectors, including vaccinia virus (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>, <a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>, <a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>), Mopeia virus (MOPV) (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), yellow fever virus (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>, <a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), measles virus (MeV) (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), and reassortant ML29 carrying the L segment from the nonpathogenic MOPV and the LASV S segment (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a><a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60 B61"">â</a><a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), have given promising results in LASV animal models, including nonhuman primates. Recombinant VSIV expressing LASV GPC (rVSV-LASV/GPC), recombinant MeV (rMeV)-expressing LASV GP and NP, chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOxl) expressing LASV-GPC, and mRNA-based or and DNA-based vaccine candidates represent five different LASV vaccine platforms currently funded by the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to accelerate LASV vaccine development. Nevertheless, effective immunization with rVSV-LASV/GPC requires a high dose that might cause significant VSIV-associated side effects (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>, <a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), and rMV-LASV does not provide sterilizing immunity against LASV infection (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), which leaves room for exploring other vaccine platforms.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The mammarenavirus IGRs play critical roles in viral gene expression and infectious particle production (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). We previously demonstrated the feasibility of replacement of the L-IGR in the L segment with the S-IGR in LCMV, generating a recombinant rLCMV/IGR(S-S) (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). Although this rLCMV(IGR/S-S) grew to a relatively high titer in cultured cells <i>in vitro</i>, the virus was highly attenuated <i>in vivo</i> and provided complete protection to immunized laboratory mice against typically lethal LCMV-WT exposure (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). In the present study, we used the same attenuation strategy to generate rLASV(IGR/S-S), in which the L-IGR in the L segment was replaced with the S-IGR. Although rLASV(IGR/S-S) exhibited a moderate decrease in viral fitness in cultured cells compared to rLASV-WT, its viral titer still reached 1âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml in Vero cells. Such a high viral titer response is important to develop a cost-effective LAV vaccine. Moreover, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was highly attenuated in both strain 13 and Hartley guinea pigs. Importantly, immunization with only 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was able to protect these guinea pigs against an otherwise lethal exposure to LASV. Consistent with results from other LASV vaccine platform studies (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>, <a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>), protection against an otherwise lethal dose of LASV in guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) occurred in the absence of detectable titers of LASV-specific neutralizing antibodies.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Genetic stability is a critical feature of an LAV candidate. A common concern about viral LAV is their potential for reversion to a more virulent phenotype, which is particularly important for RNA viruses because their error-prone replication machinery enables rapid evolution. On the basis of our findings with LCMV (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>), we expect that the underlying mechanism of attenuation of rLASV(IGR/S-S) involves altered control of virus gene expression caused by a well-defined genetic determinant, namely, the replacement of the L-IGR by the S-IGR. This attenuated virus exhibited high genetic stability during serial passages in Vero cells, indicating that the emergence of rLASV(IGR/S-S) variants with increased virulence is unlikely.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our previous findings obtained with LCMV (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>), together with those we report here for LASV, indicate that replacement of the L-IGR by the S-lGR could represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation. This approach has the advantage that the corresponding recombinant virus retains the same antigenic composition and, therefore, immunogenicity potential as the parental pathogenic strain.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The development of LASV reverse genetics has provided us a novel powerful tool to manipulate the LASV genome. Combined with the safety features provided by the manipulation of IGRs with other attenuation strategies such as codon-deoptimization (CD) (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>, <a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>), the generated LASV LAV could provide broad cross-protection against isolates from different LASV lineages while exhibiting optimal safety profiles.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

Groups were immunized s.c. with 10<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<i>n</i>â=â8 per dose, <i>n</i>â=â16 total) or were mock-immunized with PBS (<i>n</i>â=â7). At 30 days p.i., all animals were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of GPA-LASV.

<div role=""paragraph"">To measure LASV-specific antibody titers, an IgG ELISA was developed in-house. The LASV antigens used in this assay were crude cell extracts generated from LASV-infected Vero cells. These extracts were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) and subjected to gamma irradiation (50 kSv) to inactivate viable virus before removal from the BSL-4 laboratory. Plates were coated with LASV-infected cell extracts diluted in coating buffer (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) at a concentration of 50âng/well, and the plates were stored at 4Â°C. The plates were washed six times with PBST (PBSâplusâ0.2% Tween 20 [Sigma-Aldrich]), and 300âÎ¼l of blocking buffer (PBST plus 3% normal chicken serum [Abcam] plus 2% milk [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) was added to each well. After incubation at 37Â°C for 2 h, heat-inactivated irradiated plasma that had been serially diluted 2-fold was added to the plates, and the plates were kept at 4Â°C overnight. After the plates were washed six times with PBST, goat anti-guinea pig IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 1 h and washed again with PBST. Antibody-antigen complexes were revealed by adding 3,3â²,5,5â²-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10âmin at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped with stop solution. The absorbance was read at 450ânm on an Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC, USA). The average signal from normal guinea pig plasma plus 3Ã standard deviations was set as the cutoff value for endpoint titer measurement (<a href=""#B72"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B72"">72</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">To evaluate the genetic stability of rLASV(IGR/S-S) in cell culture, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was serially passaged 15 times in Vero cells. Briefly, Vero cells were infected with rLASV(IGR/S-S) in a 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flask (defined as passage 0 [P0]) at MOIâ=â0.01. At 72 h p.i., TCS (P1) were collected, and virus titer was measured by plaque assay. Then, fresh Vero cells were inoculated with P1 TCS (MOIâ=â0.01) to generate P2. This process was repeated to generate P15. P1, P5, P10, and P15 of rLASV(IGR/S-S) were inactivated and vRNA was extracted using a PureLink RNA minikit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever, infects several hundred thousand people in Western Africa, resulting in many lethal Lassa fever cases. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration-licensed countermeasures are available to prevent or treat LASV infection. We describe the generation of a novel LASV live-attenuated vaccine candidate rLASV(IGR/S-S), which is based on the replacement of the large genomic segment noncoding intergenic region (IGR) with that of the small genome segment. rLASV(IGR/S-S) is less fit in cell culture than wild-type virus and does not cause clinical signs in inoculated guinea pigs. Importantly, rLASV(IGR/S-S) protects immunized guinea pigs against an otherwise lethal exposure to LASV.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Lassa fever (LF) was first described in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969 (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). The causative agent of LF, Lassa virus (LASV), was subsequently discovered and isolated from LF patients and its natural host reservoir, the Natal mastomys (<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mastomys natalensis</span>) (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). LF poses a significant public health burden in the areas where it is endemic, mainly sub-Saharan Western Africa (e.g., Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone). A single longitudinal study conducted more than 30âyears ago in Sierra Leone estimated that hundreds of thousands of LASV infections occurred annually (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Among the people infected, 80% are asymptomatic, whereas the other 20% develop disease that usually requires hospital admission. Nevertheless, LASV infection was largely ignored as a public health threat for extended periods of time (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>), and the true incidence of LASV infections and the public health burden of LF in Western Africa remain unknown but are likely significant. Case fatality rates (CFRs) of 15% to 20% have been reported among hospitalized LF patients (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). Recently, the occurrence of a high number of LF cases associated with high (up to 60%) case fatality rates in Nigeria (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>, <a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>) triggered reevaluation of LF risk for global health security (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). Moreover, LASV expansion outside its traditional areas of endemicity and increased travel have resulted in exportation of LF cases from Western African countries where the disease is endemic to countries where it is nonendemic (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). To date, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed countermeasures are available to prevent or treat LASV, and current anti-LASV therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Due to the impact of LF on human health and limited existing countermeasures to combat LF, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LF on the revised list of priority diseases for development of effective vaccines (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Like other mammarenaviruses (<i>Bunyavirales</i>: <i>Arenaviridae</i>), LASV is an enveloped virus with a bisegmented, single-stranded RNA genome (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Each viral genome segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two viral proteins from open reading frames separated by noncoding intergenic regions (IGRs) (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). The large (L) segment encodes the large (L) protein that functions as a viral RNA (vRNA)-directed RNA polymerase and RING finger protein Z, which functions as a matrix-like protein for virion assembly and budding (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a><a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16 B17"">â</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). The small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP) precursor (GPC) (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a><a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">â</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). NP and L, together with the vRNA, form the viral L and S ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) responsible for directing replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome. NP is also involved in counteracting innate immune responses during viral infection (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a><a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23 B24"">â</a><a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). GPC is cotranslationally processed by cellular signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide (SSP) and a GPC precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved by the cellular proprotein convertase and subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) to generate GP1 and GP2 subunits. The GP1 and GP2 subunits, together with the SSP, form mature GP peplomers on the surface of the virion envelope that mediate virion cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">â</a><a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For a given mammarenavirus, S-IGRs and L-IGRs differ in both sequence and predicted secondary structures. The IGRs play critical roles in mammarenavirus transcriptional control and production of infectious particles (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). The L-IGR and S-IGR of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) have distinct functional roles in posttranscriptional control of viral gene expression (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). The importance of the IGRs in viral multiplication has also been documented for other arenaviruses. For instance, replication of a recombinant Lujo virus with a 36-nucleotide deletion in the L-IGR was impaired in cultured cells compared to its parental virus (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). A Machupo virus with a 35-nucleotide deletion within the L-IGR was only moderately less fit in cell culture than the wild-type (WT) virus but highly attenuated <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Importantly, a recombinant LCMV containing the S-IGR in both the S and L genome segments [rLCMV(IGR/S-S)] was only modestly less fit in cultured cells than rLCMV-WT. However, rLCMV(IGR/S-S) was highly attenuated in a laboratory mouse model of LCMV infection, but mice immunized with rLCMV(IGR/S-S) were fully protected against an otherwise lethal infection with rLCMV-WT (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">On the basis of these promising results, we examined whether reorganization of IGRs could represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation that could be applied to LASV. In line with prospective epidemiological studies in Western Africa, live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) represent the most feasible approach to control LF, as LAVs induce long-term robust cell-mediated responses following single immunizations (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Here, we report the generation of a recombinant LASV that contains the LASV S-IGR in both the S and L genome segments, rLASV(IGR/S-S). <i>In vitro</i>, the viral fitness of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was moderately decreased compared to rLASV-WT. <i>In vivo</i>, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was fully attenuated in both strain 13 and Hartley guinea pigs but provided full protection, upon a single subcutaneous (s.c.) low-dose administration, against an otherwise lethal exposure to LASV-WT. Our data support further development of this strategy as a general mechanism for the development of LAVs to combat human mammarenavirus infections.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Generation of rLASV(IGR/S-S).</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">LASV L- and S-IGRs are different in both sequence and predicted structure (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). A previously established LASV mouse RNA polymerase I promoter-based reverse genetic system was used to generate a recombinant LASV containing the S-IGR in both L and S segments [rLASV(IGR/S-S)] (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>) (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>, <a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). However, several attempts to rescue rLASV(IGR/S-S) were unsuccessful. As an alternative approach, we used a LASV reverse genetic system in which intracellular synthesis of L and S segment vRNAs was under the control of the Escherichia phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). HEK293T/17 cells were transfected with the indicated set of five plasmids (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). On day 6âposttransfection (p.t.), tissue culture supernatants (TCS) (P0D6) were collected, and transfected HEK293T/17 cells were cocultured with fresh Vero cells. After days 10 (day 4 of coculture [P0D10]), 13 (day 7 of coculture [P0D13]), and 17 (day 11 of coculture [P0D17]) p.t., TCS were collected, and viral titers in TCS were determined for all four time points by plaque assay (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a>). At day 6âp.t., unlike rLASV-WT, infectious rLASV(IGR/S-S) was not detected in TCS. However, in cocultures of transfected HEK293T/17 with Vero cells, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was recovered at a low titer (1.5âÃâ10<sup>3</sup> PFU/ml) followed by an increased titer seen after transfer to fresh Vero cells (4.83âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> PFU/ml at P0D13) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1D</a>).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Characterization of rLASV(IGR/S-S).</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">rLASV-WT and rLASV(IGR/S-S) growth kinetics were compared by inoculating interferon (IFN)-competent (A549) and IFN-deficient (Vero) cells with these viruses at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>). Viral titers were measured daily for 4âdays postexposure (p.e.). rLASV(IGR/S-S) replicated efficiently in both cell types, although viral peak titers in both cell lines were up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of rLASV-WT (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">B</a>). The plaque sizes produced by rLASV(IGR/S-S) (0.60âÂ±â0.21âmm in diameter) were significantly smaller than those caused by rLASV-WT (2.12âÂ±â0.74âmm; <i>n</i>â=â25, <i>Pâ&lt;â</i>0.0001) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2C</a>). Viral spread was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay in A549 and Vero cells infected with rLASV-WT or rLASV(IGR/S-S). Both GP-positive and NP-positive cell numbers were lower in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-infected cells than in rLASV-WT-infected cells at 48âh and 72âh p.e. (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2D</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">E</a>; see also <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Reduced GP and NP expression was also observed in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-infected A549 cells by Western blotting (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2F</a>). Taking the results together, the reorganization of IGR in LASV genome modestly reduced fitness in cultured cells.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Next, we examined whether replacement of L-IGR with S-IGR in the L segment would have an appreciable impact on LASV virulence <i>in vivo</i>. Since strain 13 guinea pigs are highly sensitive to LASV infection, with 100% lethality following s.c. exposure to 10<sup>3</sup> PFU (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), the safety profile of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was evaluated in strain 13 guinea pigs.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Strain 13 guinea pigs were inoculated s.c. with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<i>n</i>â=â5), rLASV-WT (<i>n</i>â=â4), or LASV (<i>n</i>â=â5). All animals inoculated with rLASV(IGR/S-S) survived to the end of the study (day 42 p.e.) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>) without developing any overt clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>), including weight loss (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>) or elevated temperature (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3D</a>). In contrast, all animals inoculated with rLASV-WT or LASV developed several clinical signs of infection (e.g., ruffled coat, labored respiration), body weight loss, and transient elevated temperatures (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>, <a href=""#fig3"">C</a>, and <a href=""#fig3"">D</a>, respectively). Two of 4 rLASV-WT-exposed and 4 of 5 LASV-exposed guinea pigs eventually met euthanasia criteria. Viral loads in blood at the different times p.e. (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>) and in the indicated tissues at the end of the study (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>) were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). vRNAs were not detected in the blood collected at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 p.e. from the majority of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs. Low concentrations of viral RNA (9.32âÃâ10<sup>3</sup> vRNA copies/ml) were detected at day 7 p.e. from one rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pig (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>). In contrast, in rLASV-WT-exposed or LASV-exposed guinea pigs, high concentrations of vRNAs were detected in blood samples collected at day 7 and day 14 p.e. (average 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> LASV vRNA copies/ml) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3E</a>). As with the blood samples, vRNAs were not detected in tissues collected from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs at the experimental endpoint (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>). In contrast, vRNAs were detected in most tissues tested from rLASV-WT-inoculated or LASV-inoculated animals (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3F</a>). Anti-LASV IgG plasma titers determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3G</a>) were detected in rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs, suggesting that they were infected with rLASV(IGR/S-S). No anti-LASV neutralization antibody (nAb) titer was detected in the sera of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs at the study endpoint (data not shown).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Significant histopathological lesions were not observed in the examined tissues of rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>), and all examined tissues from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-inoculated guinea pigs were negative for LASV antigen (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>). In contrast, typical acute LF lesions, including those resulting from interstitial pneumonia (data not shown), hepatic degeneration and necrosis (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>, white arrow), endocarditis (data not shown), and splenic lymphoid depletion (data not shown), were observed in all guinea pigs that succumbed to rLASV-WT or LASV infection. Positive LASV antigen staining was observed mainly in macrophages, epithelial cells, and/or arterial endothelial cells.

<div role=""paragraph"">To test whether a single dose of rLASV(IGR/S-S) could provide protection to strain 13 guinea pigs against a typically lethal LASV exposure, strain 13 guinea pigs were immunized with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) s.c. (<i>n</i>â=â4) or with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as an immunization control (<i>n</i>â=â5) (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5</a>). At 30âdays postimmunization (p.i.), these guinea pigs were exposed to 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of LASV s.c., and animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of infection throughout the study. Like the previous observation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>), guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) did not develop any clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2A</a>) or of abnormal weight loss (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2B</a>), although transient elevated temperatures were observed from day 8 p.i. (day â22 p.e.) to day 13 p.i. (day â17 p.e.) (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2C</a>). All rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs survived the typically lethal exposure to LASV (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>) without developing any clinical signs of disease (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>), weight loss (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>), or elevated temperatures (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). In contrast, all mock-immunized guinea pigs developed classic disease signs of LASV infection (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>), began losing weight at day 8 p.e. (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>), and had elevated (&gt;40Â°C) temperatures at day 9 p.e. (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). In the mock-immunization group, 3 of 5 guinea pigs succumbed to LASV infection on days 15 to 16 p.e., one guinea pig developed mild to moderate clinical signs until the study endpoint, and one guinea pig had mild clinical signs and recovered from infection (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a> and <a href=""#fig5"">B</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Next, a low dose of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was evaluated for efficacy to protect against LASV infection. Hartley (outbred) guinea pigs are less sensitive than strain 13 (inbred) guinea pigs to LASV infection, with 30% lethality following s.c. administration of 2.4âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> PFU (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). However, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of guinea pig-adapted LASV isolate Josiah (GPA-LASV) in Hartley guinea pigs results in â¥80% lethality (reference <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a> and unpublished data). Given the limited availability of strain 13 guinea pigs, the Hartley model is attractive for testing the efficacy of LASV therapeutic and vaccine candidates (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>).

All guinea pigs immunized with either 10<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) were protected against GPA-LASV-associated disease without having any clinical signs of disease [<i>Pâ=â</i>0.0442 for both doses of rLASV(IGR/S-S)] (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7A</a> to <a href=""#fig7"">D</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">Viremia was assessed by RT-qPCR on days â16 and â2 preexposure [days 14 and 28 after rLASV(IGR/S-S) immunization]. At day â16 preexposure (day 14 p.i.), vRNAs were detected in 3 of 8 and 2 of 8 animals that were immunized with 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of rLASV-IGR(S-S), respectively. At day â2 preexposure (day 28 p.i.), vRNAs were not detected in blood of any of the rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized animals (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7E</a>). Importantly, at day 12 after GPA-LASV exposure, vRNAs were detected in all mock-immunized guinea pigs (average 10<sup>7</sup> vRNA copies/ml) but not in any rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized animals (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7E</a>). Likewise, high vRNA loads were detected in most of the tissues collected from mock-immunized animals that had succumbed to GPA-LASV infection (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, red). vRNAs were also detected in different tissues collected from mock-immunized animals that had recovered from GPA-LASV infection (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, orange). However, vRNAs were not detected in most tissues from rLASV(IGR/S-S)-immunized guinea pigs. The exception was a very low concentration of vRNAs (9.3âÃâ10 vRNA copies/mg tissue, i.e., below the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ]) that was detected in the spleen of one guinea pig that had been immunized with 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7F</a>, blue and green).

Anti-LASV neutralizing antibodies were detected in the serum of 8 of 16 guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) and exposed to GPA-LASV, suggesting that neutralization antibodies do not play an important role in the protection provided by rLASV(IGR/S-S) (<a href=""#fig7"">Fig.Â 7H</a>).

<div role=""paragraph"">To develop any LAV, evaluation of the genetic stability of LAV during multiplication in infected cells is critical. Therefore, the genetic stability of rLASV(IGR/S-S) <i>in vitro</i> was investigated by serial passaging in Vero cells. To that end, Vero cells were inoculated (MOIâ=â0.01) with rLASV(IGR/S-S) and at 72 h p.e., TCS were collected (passage 1 [P1]), and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Fresh Vero cells were inoculated (MOIâ=â0.01) with rLASV(IGR/S-S) P1, and this process was serially repeated for a total of 15 passages (P15). Endpoint titers of each passage were in the range from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> PFU/ml (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8A</a>). The full-length viral genome sequences collected at P1, P5, P10, and P15 were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with frequencies greater than 20% were recorded (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8B</a>). All SNPs detected within the S-IGR sequence in the L segment remained at a low level (2.33% Â± 1.95) during serial passages in Vero cells. Several mutations occurred in the remainder of the L segment (e.g., T1856C, T2023C, and T4241A) and in the S segment (e.g., C1915T), which undulated in frequency during passages, suggesting that these mutations may not confer significant selective advantages. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), A1691T, accumulated in the S segment during P10 to P15. At P15, SNPs T239A (Y62F) in the GPC gene of the S segment and T5350A (K580N) in the L gene were present at low frequency. To test the impact of these SNPs on viral fitness, the growth kinetics of rLASV(IGR/S-S) in Vero cells at an MOI of 0.01 were compared at P0, P5, P10, and P15. rLASV(IGR/S-S) from these passages had similar growth kinetics in Vero cells, and the viral peak titers were not statistically significantly different (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the mutations described above did not impact viral fitness in cell culture (<a href=""#fig8"">Fig.Â 8C</a>). These results demonstrate that rLASV(IGR/S-S) was genetically stable up to 15 passages in Vero cells.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Fifty years after its first description, LF still poses a major public health burden in the regions where it is endemic in Western Africa. The recent LF outbreaks in Nigeria (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), together with the lack of licensed medical countermeasures to combat LASV infection, underscore the urgent need for LASV vaccine development (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Epidemiological studies and nonhuman primate studies provided evidence supporting the concept that LASV-specific cell-mediated immune responses are associated with effective control of virus replication and subsequent recovery (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Although passive transfer of a cocktail of engineered human neutralization antibodies (nAbs) provided protective efficacy in LASV animal models (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a><a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">â</a><a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), LASV nAbs appeared at low titers in convalescing patients several months after initial infection (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). These discrepant results indicate that nAbs probably do not contribute to viral control and recovery from acute infection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Following a single immunization, LAVs often induce long-term robust cell-mediated and humoral immune response (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>) and represent the most feasible and attractive approach to combat LF within areas of endemicity. Several LF vaccine platforms based on recombinant viral vectors, including vaccinia virus (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>, <a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>), vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>, <a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>), Mopeia virus (MOPV) (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), yellow fever virus (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>, <a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), measles virus (MeV) (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), and reassortant ML29 carrying the L segment from the nonpathogenic MOPV and the LASV S segment (<a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a><a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60 B61"">â</a><a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>), have given promising results in LASV animal models, including nonhuman primates. Recombinant VSIV expressing LASV GPC (rVSV-LASV/GPC), recombinant MeV (rMeV)-expressing LASV GP and NP, chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOxl) expressing LASV-GPC, and mRNA-based or and DNA-based vaccine candidates represent five different LASV vaccine platforms currently funded by the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to accelerate LASV vaccine development. Nevertheless, effective immunization with rVSV-LASV/GPC requires a high dose that might cause significant VSIV-associated side effects (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>, <a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), and rMV-LASV does not provide sterilizing immunity against LASV infection (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>), which leaves room for exploring other vaccine platforms.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The mammarenavirus IGRs play critical roles in viral gene expression and infectious particle production (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). We previously demonstrated the feasibility of replacement of the L-IGR in the L segment with the S-IGR in LCMV, generating a recombinant rLCMV/IGR(S-S) (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). Although this rLCMV(IGR/S-S) grew to a relatively high titer in cultured cells <i>in vitro</i>, the virus was highly attenuated <i>in vivo</i> and provided complete protection to immunized laboratory mice against typically lethal LCMV-WT exposure (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). In the present study, we used the same attenuation strategy to generate rLASV(IGR/S-S), in which the L-IGR in the L segment was replaced with the S-IGR. Although rLASV(IGR/S-S) exhibited a moderate decrease in viral fitness in cultured cells compared to rLASV-WT, its viral titer still reached 1âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml in Vero cells. Such a high viral titer response is important to develop a cost-effective LAV vaccine. Moreover, rLASV(IGR/S-S) was highly attenuated in both strain 13 and Hartley guinea pigs. Importantly, immunization with only 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of rLASV(IGR/S-S) was able to protect these guinea pigs against an otherwise lethal exposure to LASV. Consistent with results from other LASV vaccine platform studies (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>, <a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>), protection against an otherwise lethal dose of LASV in guinea pigs immunized with rLASV(IGR/S-S) occurred in the absence of detectable titers of LASV-specific neutralizing antibodies.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Genetic stability is a critical feature of an LAV candidate. A common concern about viral LAV is their potential for reversion to a more virulent phenotype, which is particularly important for RNA viruses because their error-prone replication machinery enables rapid evolution. On the basis of our findings with LCMV (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>), we expect that the underlying mechanism of attenuation of rLASV(IGR/S-S) involves altered control of virus gene expression caused by a well-defined genetic determinant, namely, the replacement of the L-IGR by the S-IGR. This attenuated virus exhibited high genetic stability during serial passages in Vero cells, indicating that the emergence of rLASV(IGR/S-S) variants with increased virulence is unlikely.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our previous findings obtained with LCMV (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>), together with those we report here for LASV, indicate that replacement of the L-IGR by the S-lGR could represent a general molecular strategy for mammarenavirus attenuation. This approach has the advantage that the corresponding recombinant virus retains the same antigenic composition and, therefore, immunogenicity potential as the parental pathogenic strain.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The development of LASV reverse genetics has provided us a novel powerful tool to manipulate the LASV genome. Combined with the safety features provided by the manipulation of IGRs with other attenuation strategies such as codon-deoptimization (CD) (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>, <a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>), the generated LASV LAV could provide broad cross-protection against isolates from different LASV lineages while exhibiting optimal safety profiles.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

Although the strain is most often harmless, there have been numerous incidents of mild to life-threatening accidents with this strain and others. In an attempt to further attenuate the Lister strain, we investigated the role of 5 genomic regions known to be deleted in the modified VACV Ankara (MVA) genome in virulence in immunodeficient mice, immunogenicity in immunocompetent mice, and vaccine efficacy in a cowpox virus challenge model. Lister mutants were constructed so as to delete each of the 5 regions or various combinations of these regions. All of the mutants replicated efficiently in tissue culture except region I mutants, which multiplied more poorly in human cells than the parental strain. Mutants with single deletions were not attenuated or only moderately so in athymic nude mice. Mutants with multiple deletions were more highly attenuated than those with single deletions. Deleting regions II, III, and V together resulted in total attenuation for nude mice and partial attenuation for SCID mice. In immunocompetent mice, the Lister deletion mutants induced VACV specific humoral responses equivalent to those of the parental strain but in some cases lower cell-mediated immune responses. All of the highly attenuated mutants protected mice from a severe cowpox virus challenge at low vaccine doses. The data suggest that several of the Lister mutants combining multiple deletions could be used in smallpox vaccination or as live virus vectors at doses equivalent to those used for the traditional vaccine while displaying increased safety.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Vaccinia virus (VACV) has displayed extraordinary efficacy as a live attenuated vaccine since it has enabled the eradication of smallpox, one of the most deadly infectious diseases for mankind. Although smallpox vaccination is no longer routinely employed, some countries continue to vaccinate selected populations because of the fear of biological warfare or bioterrorism. During the course of their use, the smallpox vaccines were responsible for numerous vaccine-associated accidents like eczema vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia in individuals with immune deficiencies or skin disorders. Encephalitis was also long recognized as a very serious vaccine-related risk with an unknown predisposition (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), and vaccine-induced myopericarditis has been documented as an adverse event (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). It is therefore not surprising that a good deal of research has been devoted to designing strategies that reduce the risks associated with smallpox vaccination (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). Further attenuation of the smallpox vaccine has also been sought because VACV is an attractive live virus vector for vaccination against infectious diseases and displays promising activity as a vector for prophylaxis and therapy of cancer (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was one of the first VACV strains shown to be highly attenuated in small-animal models and safe in human trials (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>, <a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>). MVA was isolated during the 1960s from the chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara strain (CVA) by extensive serial passage in chicken embryo fibroblasts, a process which entailed 6 major deletions as well as numerous smaller deletions and point mutations within 122 of the 195 open reading frames (ORFs) (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). One of the outstanding properties of MVA is its failure to multiply in most mammalian cells, particularly human cells. Studies in HeLa cells have shown that MVA infection is followed by a nearly complete virus life cycle up to the accumulation of immature (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>) or aberrant (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>) viral particles and the release of a few aberrant enveloped viral particles (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). This abortive virus life cycle is clearly sufficient to immunize mice against a variety of orthopoxvirus challenge infections, to vaccinate nonhuman primates against severe monkeypox virus infection (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>, <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>), and to induce a VACV-like immune response in human volunteers (<a href=""#B71"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B71"">71</a>). In most studies which have evaluated MVA as a vaccine against challenge orthopoxvirus infections, it has displayed efficacy only at much higher doses than the traditional smallpox vaccine (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B75"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B75"">75</a>) (with one surprising exception [<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>]), in keeping with the fact that MVA is unable to propagate at the site of inoculation and large virus doses are well tolerated. Such high doses have even been shown to have the added advantage of inducing a more rapid immune response than traditional smallpox vaccines (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>, <a href=""#B62"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B62"">62</a>, <a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In view of the very promising behavior of MVA as a highly attenuated smallpox vaccine as well as a vaccine vector, it is important to gain a full understanding of the molecular basis of its attenuation and vaccine efficacy. Clearly the failure of MVA to multiply in most mammalian cells is one essential feature that explains <i>in vivo</i> attenuation although the full spectrum of viral genes that accounts for this phenotype has only been partially characterized (<a href=""#B74"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B74"">74</a>). The MVA genome also lacks a number of genes encoding immunomodulatory functions found in other VACV genomes, indicating that it does not interfere with the antiviral immune response as efficiently as other VACV strains (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). In fact, numerous studies have shown that MVA activates the innate immune response more effectively than standard VACV (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B72"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B72"">72</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two strategies were considered to further investigate how the major deletions in the MVA strain affect its attenuation and vaccine efficacy. The first one would involve introducing regions deleted from the MVA strain back into this virus, whereas the second would involve deleting the same regions from another virus, the parental strain of MVA (CVA) or a related strain. We chose the latter strategy because it might allow the isolation of more-attenuated VACV strains from an established smallpox vaccine whose efficacy had been historically demonstrated. Instead of using the CVA strain as the starting point, as recently reported by Meisinger-Henshel et al. (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>), we chose to start from the VACV Lister (VACV-Lis) strain because this WHO reference strain was one of the most widely used strains during the smallpox eradication campaign (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Recent data have established that the Lister strain induces human antibody responses comparable to that of the Dryvax strain, another commonly used smallpox vaccine (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Genomic deletions of this strain could increase its safety and make it more suitable for further use. It was also postulated that using an established smallpox vaccine with a smaller number of deletions than the number that occurs in the MVA strain may lead to a safe vaccine that is effective at lower doses than those used with the MVA strain.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Virus and cell culture.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A clonal isolate of the Lister strain of the smallpox vaccine, designated VACV-107 (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), was used as the parental strain for isolation of deletion mutants. Virus was propagated on the chicken embryonic stem cell line EB 14 (provided by Vivalis, France) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 40 Î¼g/ml gentamicin. Virus stocks were produced on EB 14 cells; however, because monolayers of these cells tend to detach, virus titrations were preferentially carried out on baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) cultured in DMEM and supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml Bacto tryptose phosphate, 10% FCS, and 40 Î¼g/ml gentamicin. Vero cells used in virus neutralization assays were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 100 IU penicillin/ml, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin. HeLa and MRC5 cells used to follow virus multiplication were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS or in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 40 Î¼g/ml gentamicin.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Molecular cloning and PCR.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">PCR amplification of viral DNA and molecular cloning in plasmids were carried out according to previously described methods (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>). DNA fragments encompassing approximately 500 bp on either side of the regions targeted for deletion were amplified from the VACV-107 genome using the oligonucleotides listed in <a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>. Fragments on the left sides of the regions to be deleted were amplified so as to have a left XhoI site and a right BamHI site, while fragments on the right sides of the regions to be deleted were designed to have a left BamHI site and a right SacI site. PCR-amplified fragments were inserted into minimal bacterial vector pEM8, derived from pPoly3 (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>) and containing unique adjacent sites for XhoI, BamHI, SacI, EcoRI, and PstI in that order. After PCR amplification the left side of each region targeted for deletion was inserted into pEM8 using XhoI and BamHI whereas the right side was inserted using BamHI and SacI. A cassette flanked by unique SacI and PstI sites and encoding both green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a VACV synthetic early promoter (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) and the enzyme guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) under the control of the VACV 7.5-kDa promoter (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>) was then inserted adjacent to the rightmost fragment into the EcoRI and PstI sites of pEM8 using a single-stranded oligonucleotide linker to ligate the SacI site to the EcoRI site.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Isolation of deletion mutants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Virus deletion mutants were isolated by transient dominant selection, a procedure that results in a region being deleted or modified in another manner without any foreign selection marker being retained (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). EB 14 cells were plated at approximately 300,000 cells per 35-mm<sup>2</sup> petri dish, incubated overnight at 37Â°C in a cell culture incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and then infected with approximately 0.1 PFU/cell for 1 h. After this period of time the suspension containing unadsorbed virus was removed, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and 1 Î¼g of the appropriate plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One day later cells were observed under the microscope by UV illumination to visualize expression of GFP, a marker of successful transfection, and then frozen at â20Â°C. Afterwards, infected cells were subjected to several additional rounds of freezing and thawing, and virus-containing cell lysates were used to infect fresh EB 14 cells in the presence of selective pressure for the expression of the GPT gene. Viral plaques formed in the presence of the selective medium were visualized by microscopy under UV light, and fluorescent plaques were picked and amplified on EB 14 cells in liquid medium in the presence of selective pressure. This procedure of cloning the virus under selective pressure and amplification was repeated several times. Two or three independent virus clones able to form fluorescent plaques were then used to infect fresh cells after limiting dilution and in the absence of selective pressure but under an agarose overlay. Nonfluorescent plaques were picked after 2 days of infection, and the virus was amplified in the absence of selective pressure. A sample of the amplified virus stock was used to extract total DNA, and the DNA was subjected to PCR using one of the appropriate pairs of primers indicated in <a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>, column 5. The primers were designed to detect the presence of the deleted viral DNA, undeleted viral DNA, or a mixture of the two. Primers A and B together were designed to flank the areas deleted. Primer Aâ² was chosen so that it lies within the deleted sequence and together with B enables amplification of a fragment in the parental virus. Virus stocks containing mixtures of deletion and parental virus generated the two PCR products 1 and 2 listed in column 6 of <a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>, whereas stocks containing only virus with the targeted region deleted generated only PCR product 2 (approximately 500-bp fragments in all cases except for one deletion IV stock which generated a 1,000-bp fragment).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Virus clones containing only DNA with deletions were subjected to two additional cloning steps in the absence of selective pressure. The deletions were again confirmed in another round of PCR analysis of DNA from the more thoroughly cloned virus mutants. To detect large DNA fragments (2.5 to 9 kbp) in the VACV-107 strain or the corresponding shortened fragments in the deletion mutants, PCR amplification was carried out using the Expand Long Template system (Roche Applied Science) by a common protocol for all viruses of 30 cycles with 8-min elongation periods. Finally, virus stocks were made by amplification on EB 14 cells. Viruses with simultaneous deletions in multiple regions were constructed by repeating the operations outlined on virus that already had deletions. A portion of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene was also deleted in a similar manner to isolate a VACV mutant with this gene deleted.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Evaluation of neutralizing antibodies and T lymphocyte responses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Vaccinated mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and bled by intracardiac puncture, and VACV-neutralizing antibodies in serum samples were titrated according to a previously described method (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>) validated in four laboratories (<a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>). Briefly, serum samples were first incubated at 56Â°C for 30 min to inactivate complement and then subjected to serial 2-fold dilutions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The samples were mixed with an equal volume of VACV containing approximately 35 PFU in 0.1 ml for 1 h at 37Â°C, and the mixture was added to Vero cell monolayers. Two days later virus plaques were counted. The neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal serum dilution that led to a 50% reduction in the number of plaques compared to the control. The threshold of the titration was 10.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To measure T lymphocyte responses, the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes expressing intracellular gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) were determined by flow cytometry as previously described (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Briefly, mature bone marrow dendritic cells from uninfected BALB/c mice were infected with VACV and then incubated with spleen cell suspensions from infected animals for 6 h at a ratio of one mature dendritic cell for two splenocytes. Brefeldin A (5 Î¼g/ml) was added for the last 4 h to block cytokine secretion. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled anti-CD8b2 and allophycocyanin (APC)-coupled anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), fixed, and permeabilized. Intracellular IFN-Î³ was stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled anti-IFN-Î³ MAb, and cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde diluted in PBS. Flow cytometry was performed on an FC500 (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL), and the data were analyzed with Cytomics RXP software (Beckman Coulter).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Vaccination of mice against a lethal intranasal CPXV infection.</h3>

Groups of 6 animals were tested and treated in the same manner for each condition studied. Before vaccination, 4-week-old mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg of body weight) and atropine (1.5 mg/kg). The mice were then scarified at the base of the tail by a series of scratches using the tip of a 23-gauge needle, and 3 Î¼l of virus at various concentrations was deposited at the scarification site according to an established method (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>, <a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) that performed consistently in studies we conducted previously (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>, <a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). A characteristic pustule, testifying a take, was observed 8 to 10 days later at the site of scarification in mice vaccinated with the highest virus doses and in some mice vaccinated with lower doses.

<section id=""sec-3-1""><h3>Isolation of VACV deletion mutants and analysis of their multiplication in cell culture.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Six major regions are deleted in the MVA strain relative to other closely related VACV strains. These regions are localized at the left and right ends of the viral genome and have been previously designated with roman numerals from I to VI (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). We deleted each of these regions (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>, top) except region VI from the genome of VACV-107, a clonal isolate of the Lister strain, using the transient dominant selection method described by Falkner and Moss (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). Region I (3,585 bp), which encodes several putative proteins of unknown function as well as a serine protease inhibitor (Spi1) important for virus host range in at least one human cell line (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), was deleted individually. Regions II and V, which are adjacent at the left end of the genome, were deleted together with the intervening region (overall 8,552 bp). This affected 10 ORFs, including one encoding a kelch protein that antagonizes viral immunopathology (C2L in the VACV Copenhagen strain) (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>), one encoding a complement control protein (C3L in the VACV Copenhagen strain) (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), and one encoding a host range protein and inhibitor of type I interferons (K1L) (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), as well as two genes that lie at the boundary of regions II and V (the virulence factor N1L gene [<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>] and the Î± amanitin-sensitive gene N2L [<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a>]), the former frameshifted at its 3â² end and the latter internally deleted in MVA (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Region III (3,519 bp with respect to VACV-107, corresponding to a 3,501-bp deletion with respect to VACV Copenhagen), overlapping four ORFs, including ORFs encoding a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (CrmC [<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>]), a suppressor of Toll/IL-1 signaling (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), and a kelch protein which affects the virus-induced cytopathic effect (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>), was deleted on its own. Region IV was deleted in two steps. The first step was to delete 1,742 bp with respect to VACV-107 (1,771 bp with respect to VACV Copenhagen) at both ends of the Lister genome; the deleted regions overlap five genes corresponding to truncated segments of full-length genes found in other orthopoxviruses. Viral deletion mutants were screened by PCR to identify those with mirrored deletions at both ends of the genome. The second step involved deleting 2,074 bp overlapping a TNF receptor (CrmE) gene (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>) and an antiapoptotic virulence factor gene (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). The two deletions were then combined in one virus to streamline subsequent analyses. Once virus mutants with single deletions or in some cases combined deletions were isolated, they were used as parental viruses to isolate mutants with increasing numbers of deletions in such a way that various combinations of the five targeted deletions were constructed. The predicted structures of the mutant genomes were confirmed by PCR and illustrated for one mutant which had all five deletions (VACV ÎI-V) (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>, bottom). Primers were chosen for each region deleted so as to amplify an 0.5- or 1-kbp fragment in the mutant virus VACV ÎI-V, whereas fragments ranging in size from 2.6 kbp to 9.1 kbp were amplified in the VACV-107 strain as predicted from the sizes of the intact regions in the parental virus, including the surrounding 0.5- or 1-kbp regions (<a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>, column 6). Finally, a deletion was also introduced into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the Lister strain to create a virus strain with previously documented attenuation (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The ability of the mutants to multiply in several cell lines was examined. All mutants were routinely propagated on the chicken embryonic stem cell line EB 14, and all of them were found to form plaques and multiply to high yields in these cells (data not shown). Titration of virus was performed on hamster BHK21 cells, and all of the deletion mutants produced clearly visible plaques after a 2-day incubation period. Since several of the regions deleted included previously characterized host range genes essential for multiplication in human cell lines (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>, <a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>), the deletion mutants were tested for their ability to multiply in HeLa cell cultures. Initial experiments showed that all of the mutants isolated after one round of deletion multiplied well in these human cells except mutant ÎI, which produced yields about 5-fold lower than the parental Lister strain. The influence of the ÎI deletion within the background of other deletions was then investigated. Virus titers in the infected-cell cultures of BHK21 cells were assayed after several cycles of freezing and thawing samples either 3 h after infection to estimate the amount of input virus or 48 h after infection (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01) to determine virus yield. All of the mutants containing the ÎI deletion multiplied to levels 4- to 5-fold lower than the parental Lister strain (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a>), indicating that this deletion indeed affected virus multiplication in human HeLa cells. However, there was no additional effect of the other deletions on virus multiplication, indicating that only ÎI contributed to the reduced virus yields. Similar experiments carried out in the MRC5 cell line also indicated that the ÎI deletion entailed reduced virus yields in this human diploid cell line (data not shown).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-3-2""><h3>Assessment of attenuation of the deletion mutants in nude mice and SCID mice.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">First the pathogenicity of the deletion mutants was assessed in athymic nude mice defective for the production of antigen-specific T lymphocytes and T cell-dependent antibodies because these animals are highly susceptible to VACV infection, unlike immunocompetent mice (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>, <a href=""#B59"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B59"">59</a>). Groups of six mice were inoculated by scarification at the base of the tail with virus suspensions titrating at 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/ml, thus delivering approximately 10<sup>5</sup> PFU, a dose equivalent to that used for smallpox puncture vaccination in humans, which is also recognized to be a highly effective means of vaccination in mice (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). The morbidity and mortality of the infected animals as well as those of a control mock-infected group were followed over an 8-week period in separate experiments performed at least twice for each mutant. Mock-infected animals gained weight regularly over the period of observation, whereas animals infected with the VACV-107 isolate or the original VACV Lister strain (VACV-Lis) gained weight more slowly over the first 2 weeks, then dramatically lost weight until their deaths between day 35 and 44 postinfection (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>). Loss of weight in these animals correlated with virus dissemination to other sites on the tail and the body. All of the mice infected with the single deletion mutant ÎIV or the TK gene-deleted mutant died, and some died in the groups infected with the single-deletion mutants ÎI and ÎIII although overall weight loss was delayed (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>A and B). Therefore, each of these deletions only mildly reduced the pathogenicity of the VACV-107 clone in nude mice. The double-deletion mutant ÎI,IV also induced weight loss and mortality similar to those induced by the single-deletion mutants ÎI and ÎIV. Mice infected with mutants with two or more regions deleted survived infection (except for ÎI,IV) but in most instances failed to gain weight as fast as mock-infected animals (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Mice infected with mutants ÎI,III, ÎII,V, ÎI,II,V, and ÎI,II,IV,V gained weight as fast as control animals at first but failed to reach the same body weight as uninfected animals. Mice infected with mutants ÎIII,IV, ÎI,III,IV, and ÎII,IV,V gained weight more slowly than control animals, then started to lose weight compared with the initial body weight. Therefore, these deletion mutations induced significant morbidity in nude mice, albeit not to the extent of the parental VACV strain. In contrast, mice infected with four mutants gained weight over the period of observation in a similar manner to that of the mock-infected control mice (ÎII,III,V, ÎI,II,III,V, ÎII,III,IV,V, and ÎI-V; <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>C). These data show that the combined deletion of the three genomic regions II, III, and V is sufficient to completely eliminate morbidity, as measured by loss of body weight, in nude mice. The number of secondary lesions on the tail and the rest of the body of these mice varied between 0 and 4, and their sizes were reduced (1 to 3 mm) (<a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>). The number of secondary lesions has been found to correlate closely with body weight loss in infected nude mice (see <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a> at <a href=""http://igbmc.fr/Schultz_jv2011"">http://igbmc.fr/Schultz_jv2011</a>). Overall, three independent experiments were performed with the four most highly attenuated mutants presented in <a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>C, and in two of them nude mice gained weight as if they were uninfected (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), whereas in a third experiment animals infected with mutants ÎII,III,IV,V and ÎI,II,III,V also behaved like uninfected animals (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) while animals infected with mutants ÎI-V and ÎII,III,V survived infection but failed to gain as much weight as uninfected animals (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; data not shown).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Severely immunodeficient SCID mice were then used to examine the pathogenicity of the deletion mutants that displayed the highest level of attenuation in the nude mouse model. As expected, tail scarification with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of VACV-Lis or the clonal isolate VACV-107 resulted in considerable weight loss beginning about 10 days postinfection and continuing until the animals died (<a href=""#F4"">Fig. 4</a>). On the other hand, all mice infected with the deletion mutants gained more weight than animals infected with the parental viruses but then slowly lost weight over the period of observation, probably due to slow virus multiplication in these animals. In fact, the lesion at the site of vaccination gradually increased in size, and there were several secondary lesions that appeared over time. These animals were nevertheless alive after 56 days of infection, when the experiment was ended.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">We then assessed the immune responses induced by the most highly attenuated viruses in immunocompetent BALB/c mice after vaccination by tail scarification with a virus dose equivalent to that used in immunodeficient mice (10<sup>5</sup> PFU per animal). A local lesion appeared at the site of scarification for most mice a few days after vaccination, then regressed, and the mice did not display any signs of morbidity whatever virus was employed. Four weeks later the mice were bled and neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers in the serum samples were determined and expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution leading to a 50% reduction in plaque count (<a href=""#F5"">Fig. 5</a>). Whereas uninfected animals displayed mean Nab titers less than 10, mice infected with the parental VACV-Lis strain or the clonal isolate induced similar levels of Nab (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), which were within the range of the titers found in human subjects vaccinated against smallpox (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>, <a href=""#B58"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B58"">58</a>).

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The cell-mediated immune responses were also assayed 4 weeks after tail scarification of BALB/c mice with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/animal. After 4 weeks vaccinated mice display a steady-state level in their cell-mediated immune response (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>), suggesting that this is an appropriate time to assay this response and challenge them (see below). Spleens were recovered, and spleen cell suspensions were stimulated with VACV-infected dendritic cells. The levels of VACV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were measured by assaying for the percentage of IFN-Î³-secreting cells in the spleen cell population using flow cytometry (<a href=""#F6"">Fig. 6</a>). The clonal isolate VACV-107 and the traditional Lister vaccine induced comparable VACV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte responses (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), which were about 3- to 4-fold higher than the background level in mock-infected animals (<i>P</i> = 0.001). The highly attenuated deletion mutants ÎII,III,V and ÎI,II,III,V induced a VACV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> response slightly but significantly lower than that induced by the parental VACV strains (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), whereas the mutants ÎII,III,IV,V and ÎI-V induced responses comparable to those induced by the parental strains. In the case of the specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cell response, both the uncloned VACV-Lis strain and the clonal isolate induced similar responses, which were about 8-fold higher than the basal level measured for splenocytes from mock-infected animals (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The specific CD8<sup>+</sup> response with all of the deletion mutants except ÎII,III,V was significantly lower than that induced by the parental viruses (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) but between 4- and 6-fold higher than that of uninfected animals.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-3-4""><h3>Protection of mice from CPXV challenge by vaccination with the deletion mutants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Previous studies have demonstrated that cowpox virus (CPXV) infection of mice by the intranasal route provides a model infection for smallpox and that traditional smallpox vaccines can protect against disease and death in this model system (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). In order to assess the efficacy of the most highly attenuated deletion mutants, BALB/c mice were vaccinated by scarification at the base of the tail with 1 Ã 10<sup>2</sup> to 1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of each deletion mutant, VACV-107, or VACV-Lis. Each dose was administered to six mice per group, and 1 month later the animals were challenged with 30 LD<sub>50</sub> of CPXV. All animals in the unvaccinated groups succumbed after challenge between the 6th and 10th day after infection, and none of the unvaccinated, unchallenged animals died (data not shown). Most of the animals vaccinated with the highest virus dose (10<sup>4</sup> PFU/scarification) lost between 25 and 35% of their body weight by about the ninth day postinfection because of the severity of the challenge and then progressively recovered. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of weight loss or weight recovery between animals vaccinated with the different virus mutants or the VACV parental viruses (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05) (see <a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a> at <a href=""http://igbmc.fr/Schultz_jv2011"">http://igbmc.fr/Schultz_jv2011</a>). The survival of mice in three independent experiments where each virus was tested at least twice is shown in <a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>. In two experiments all animals vaccinated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the VACV-107 Lister clone survived, and 4 out of 6 mice survived in the third experiment, consistent with the level of protection afforded by the uncloned VACV-Lis strain. Similarly, the majority of the animals vaccinated with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the deletion mutants survived (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>) and all of them survived after vaccination with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU (data not shown) except one animal in group ÎII,III,IV,V. Intermediate and poor levels of survival were observed for animals vaccinated with 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>2</sup> PFU, respectively, of VACV-107, VACV-Lis, or the deletion mutants. The viral dose able to protect 50% of the animals (PD<sub>50</sub>) was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench and found to be 3.0 Â± 0.7 log PFU in the case of the Lister clone and 3.2 Â± 0.5 log PFU with the traditional vaccine. The PD<sub>50</sub>s for the mutants were within the same range as that for the parental clone or VACV-Lis, demonstrating that the deletion of up to five selected regions in the VACV Lister virus genome did not alter the ability to efficiently protect mice against a challenge infection.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""T3"" class=""table""></figure>
</div></section></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">We have investigated the role of 5 regions in the VACV Lister genome, known to be deleted in the MVA genome (deletions I to V), on replication in human cells, virulence in the nude and SCID mouse models, induction of specific immune responses in immunocompetent mice, and vaccine efficacy in a CPXV challenge model. The influence of deleting region VI was not investigated because it was thought unlikely to affect virulence since it encompasses one gene fragmented in all VACV strains (an orthologue of the CPXV virus gene encoding the A-type inclusion protein [<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>]) as well as a truncated copy of another gene (p4c) shown to be important for association of viral particles with A-type inclusions (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), which are absent from VACV-infected cells (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Infection of human cells indicated that deletion of region I entails a significant reduction in virus multiplication. This result was not too surprising, as region I contains the SpiI gene, which has previously been shown to be required for multiplication of VACV WR in the human lung cell line A549 (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>). Deletion of region I could therefore contribute to further attenuation of the VACV Lister strain if the strain is used to vaccinate humans. Deletion mutants of the CVA strain, similar to the ones we have constructed, were extensively studied for their host ranges <i>in vitro</i> and found to be replication defective in two rabbit cell lines, consistent with deletion of the K1L gene (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). However, the same CVA mutants were able to multiply efficiently in 12 other mammalian cell lines, including 5 human cell lines (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). The distinct genetic background of the CVA strain could account for failure of the CVA deletions to affect viral multiplication in human cells as we have noticed for Lister mutants with region I deleted.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Infection of athymic nude mice with the mutants demonstrated that the deletion of single genomic regions was insufficient to induce a high level of attenuation compared with the parental viral clone VACV-107 or the traditional smallpox vaccine. Particularly interesting in this respect is region IV, which contains, in addition to a number of truncated genes, a biologically active TNF receptor (CrmE) gene previously shown to be required for VACV virulence in a murine intranasal model (<a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>) and a gene encoding a Golgi resident antiapoptotic protein whose deletion did not affect weight loss in the murine intranasal model but rather increased the severity of other signs of illness (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). Thus, the opposite effects of deleting these two genes in the ÎIV mutant may result in no phenotype at all, or alternatively these two genes may play no significant role in the particular mouse scarification model we have employed. The combined deletion of at least two regions (for instance, regions I and III) resulted in survival of all nude mice although some morbidity occurred. Several VACV mutants harboring multiple deletions were clearly more attenuated than VACV-107 or the traditional smallpox vaccine but still displayed some pathogenicity. Only four deletion mutants proved to be totally attenuated in the T cell-deficient mouse model, as ascertained from survival and body weight loss (ÎII,III,V, ÎI,II,III,V, ÎII,III,IV,V, and ÎI-V), all of them having at least regions II, III, and V deleted. In contrast, deletion of the TK gene, known to be attenuating upon VACV infection in other animal models (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>, <a href=""#B73"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B73"">73</a>), did not significantly alter virus pathogenicity for nude mice. In SCID mice, which are more severely immunocompromised than nude mice, the highly attenuated deletion mutants characterized in the nude mouse model did not induce any mortality over the period of observation but mice failed to gain weight as well as uninfected animals and eventually started to lose weight. These results reflect the fact that the deletion mutants are able to multiply in SCID mice as multiple secondary lesions appeared over time.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The data from studies in human cells, nude mice, and SCID mice suggest that the deletion of regions I, II, III, and V may be sufficient to obtain satisfactory attenuation of the Lister strain in humans. Two deletion mutants tested would best fit this requirement, namely, mutants ÎI,II,III,V and ÎI,II,III,IV,V.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Despite clear-cut attenuation in immunocompromised mice, the four most attenuated VACV deletion mutants induced humoral responses equivalent to those of the standard Lister vaccine. On the other hand, the cell-mediated immune responses induced by the mutants were in several instances significantly lower than those of the Lister parents. Nevertheless, all of the highly attenuated mutants displayed remarkable vaccine efficacy, as illustrated by protection of immunocompetent mice from a severe CPXV challenge infection. Calculation of the 50% protective dose and analysis of weight loss and recovery after challenge with CPXV did not allow us to discern any difference in vaccine efficacy between the most attenuated mutants studied. It is possible, however, that the use of lower challenge doses or other animal models would enable such a discrimination. On the other hand our results suggest that the major MVA deletions contribute to attenuation of this virus, but they cannot explain why high MVA doses are needed to achieve maximum vaccine potency. It is probably the failure of MVA to multiply in most mammalian hosts, including mice, which entails the requirement for high MVA vaccine doses. In contrast, our experimental data suggest that the VACV Lister deletion mutants that replicate in human cells (although more poorly in the case of ÎI) may be able to effectively vaccinate human subjects at a dose equivalent to that used for the traditional smallpox vaccine while displaying increased safety for immunocompromised and other contraindicated subjects.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Numerous studies of VACV mutants with single nonessential genes deleted have shown that the vast majority of these genes contribute to virulence in one animal model or another. However, few studies have examined the consequences of such attenuation for vaccine efficacy. Most of the attenuating deletions in the NYCBH and Wyeth strains, examined by Lee et al. (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), actually resulted in reduced immunogenicity at low vaccine doses, with the exception of a mutant with the TK gene deleted. On the other hand, deletion of the E3L gene, encoding a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, resulted in striking attenuation in a mouse model of severe combined immunodeficiency and considerable vaccine potency by scarification of immunocompetent mice despite the fact that the deletion mutant appeared inefficient at inducing VACV-neutralizing antibodies (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Deletion of several genes encoding immunomodulatory functions from the Wyeth strain resulted in only moderate attenuation in an intracranial weanling mouse model, and most of the mutants maintained immunogenicity although no vaccine protection studies were performed (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). Deletion of the genes encoding serpin 1 (B22R; equivalent to ORF 008 in the Lister strain) and serpin 2 (B13R in VACV Cop) from the VACV WR strain led to significant attenuation, characterized by a delay in death after infection of nude mice and lack of pathogenicity in immunocompetent mice after intraperitoneal inoculation (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). The deletion viruses maintained their ability to induce potent humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, but orthopoxvirus challenge infections were not performed. Deletion of region II in the Tian Tan strain of VACV resulted in attenuation in immunocompetent mice and immunity when used as a vaccine vector, but no challenge studies were performed (<a href=""#B77"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B77"">77</a>). Recently, by recombineering the CVA genome in bacterial artificial chromosomes, Meisinger-Henschel et al. reported the construction of deletion mutants mirroring the major MVA deletions (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). They noticed only moderate attenuation of the deletion mutants in immunocompetent mice infected intranasally and identified region V as the major region involved. Their studies clearly indicate that the 6 major deletions in the MVA strain are not sufficient to account for the characteristic MVA phenotype and that other mutations, still to be identified, are needed. The CVA deletion mutants were, however, not examined for their ability to induce an immune response or protect mice from a challenge orthopoxvirus infection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, our results extend previous findings by demonstrating that considerable virus attenuation may be achieved for immunocompromised animals if multiple regions of the Lister genome are deleted. Despite this attenuation, the deletion mutants are able to induce VACV-specific immune responses and display vaccine potency similar to that of the traditional smallpox vaccine. Recent studies have shown that VACV multiplication may be a requirement in some instances for the induction of potent immune responses (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>, <a href=""#B76"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B76"">76</a>). The combination of multiple deletions in a single virus makes it unlikely that the mutants revert to a virulent phenotype, thus providing a potentially safer yet efficient smallpox vaccine as well as the basis for the development of a novel VACV vector.</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

In an exploratory approach, we compared a new pediatric formulation with the tablet formulation administered crushed in the treatment of African children with uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Plasmodium falciparum</span> malaria. Patients were randomized to 3 different dosing groups (weights of 5 to &lt;15 kg, 15 and &lt;25 kg, and 25 to &lt;35 kg). Treatment was administered twice daily over 3 days. Plasma concentrations of artemether and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were determined at 1 and 2 h after the first dose of dispersible (<i>n</i> = 91) and crushed (<i>n</i> = 93) tablets. A full pharmacokinetic profile of lumefantrine was reconstituted on the basis of 310 (dispersible tablet) and 315 (crushed tablet) plasma samples, collected at 6 different time points (1 sample per patient). Dispersible and crushed tablets showed similar artemether and DHA maximum concentrations in plasma (<i>C</i><sub>max</sub>) for the different body weight groups, with overall means of 175 Â± 168 and 190 Â± 168 ng/ml, respectively, for artemether and 64.7 Â± 58.1 and 63.7 Â± 65.0 ng/ml, respectively, for DHA. For lumefantrine, the population <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> were 6.3 Î¼g/ml (dispersible tablet) and 7.7 Î¼g/ml (crushed tablet), whereas the areas under the concentration-time curves from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable plasma concentration measured were 574 and 636 Î¼g Â· h/ml, respectively. For both formulations, descriptive quintile analyses showed no apparent association between artemether/DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and parasite clearance time or between the lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and the occurrence of adverse events or corrected QT interval changes.

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are currently the best available treatments for uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Plasmodium falciparum</span> malaria because of their fast action, reliable efficacy, good safety profile, and potential to lower the emergence and spread of drug resistance (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>, <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). Artemether-lumefantrine (A-L; Coartem) was the first fixed-dose ACT prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has subsequently been adopted by many countries in sub-Saharan Africa as first-line treatment for uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>). The recommended 6-dose regimen of A-L, twice a day for 3 days, has been proven to be efficacious and safe in both infants and children weighing 5 to 35 kg and adults weighing &gt;35 kg (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>, <a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In young children, A-L is usually administered as a crushed tablet (CT). In an effort to ease administration of A-L, a sweetened cherry-flavored A-L dispersible tablet (DT) formulation containing the same amounts of artemether and lumefantrine as the standard tablet was developed.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed within a multicenter, investigator-blinded, randomized, noninferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of DT and CT in African infants and children with uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria. The clinical efficacy and safety data have been presented elsewhere (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). This report focuses on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) correlations assessed in large subgroups of patients. The specific objectives were to compare lumefantrine, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plasma levels between DT and CT and to assess potential relationships between these drug levels and safety and/or efficacy variables.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>Study design.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Male or female infants and children with microscopically confirmed acute uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria were recruited from 8 health care facilities in Benin (<i>n</i> = 1 site), Kenya (<i>n</i> = 3), Mali (<i>n</i> = 1), Mozambique (<i>n</i> = 1), Tanzania (<i>n</i> = 1), and Tanzania/Zanzibar (<i>n</i> = 1). The multicenter study, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, was approved by the pertinent ethics committee of each participating center and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00386763. Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the children (school-age children were additionally asked to give assent). The first patient was enrolled in August 2006, and the study was completed in March 2007. Criteria for inclusion and exclusion have been previously presented (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either A-L DT or CT (each containing 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine) within 3 different dosing groups on the basis of body weight. Treatment was administered twice daily over 3 days. The children were hospitalized for the first 3 days to allow supervised dosing at exact times (at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h). All dosages were administered with a cup, beaker, or syringe (after suspension in 10 ml water) according to body weight: 1 tablet per dose for patients weighing 5 to &lt;15 kg, 2 tablets per dose for patients weighing 15 to &lt;25 kg, and 3 tablets per dose for those weighing 25 to &lt;35 kg. Immediately afterwards, another 10 ml of water was given using the same device. The consumption of food/drink (e.g., breast milk, broth, or sweetened condensed milk) was encouraged following intake of study medication to increase absorption. Patients who vomited a dose within 1 h of treatment received a replacement dose (no more than two doses were to be replaced over the entire treatment phase). For each weight group, an independent computer-generated randomization list was applied. In a first step, approximately 20% of patients (<i>n</i> = 166) were recruited at 4 study centers and formed the basis of a protocol-mandated interim analysis to review the efficacy and safety data for up to 7 days after treatment. Following review of the interim data by an independent data monitoring board, the study was continued on the basis of adequate efficacy and safety results.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To avoid excessive blood collection in infants or children with malaria, a sparse pharmacokinetic sampling approach was used. We hypothesized that early treatment failures might be related to insufficient exposure to the rapidly acting artemether and/or DHA (as indicated by low maximum concentration in plasma [<i>C</i><sub>max</sub>] values) rather than to low exposure to slow-acting lumefantrine. Therefore, exposure to artemether and DHA was assessed in those patients recruited until the results of the interim analysis indicated adequate treatment response, as measured by 7-day cure rates. After the interim analysis, the focus was switched to lumefantrine exposure. Hence, in all patients enrolled prior to the interim analysis, two blood samples per patient were collected at 1 and 2 h after the first dose of DT or CT for the measurement of artemether and DHA in plasma (i.e., anticipated time of <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> [<i>T</i><sub>max</sub>]). In order to reconstitute a full lumefantrine pharmacokinetic profile for the population studied, one blood sample per patient was taken at 6 different time points in patients enrolled at all 8 study centers after the interim analysis. Samples were taken for 50% of the patients at approximately 6 h after dose 6 (anticipated <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>) and at 5 other time points (at approximately 6 h after dose 3 or 6 h after dose 5 or on day 3, 7, or 14) in the other 50% of patients (i.e., in about 10% of patients at each of the 5 other time points).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">All blood samples (maximum, 1.5 ml per sample) were taken by venipuncture into heparin-coated tubes. After centrifugation, aliquots of plasma were harvested and frozen at â70Â°C. Artemether and DHA were measured in plasma using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5.0 ng/ml (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>). Lumefantrine was measured in plasma by liquid chromatography-MS/MS using electrospray ionization; the LOQ was 50 ng/ml. The within-study assay validation showed an assay precision (coefficient of variation [CV]) of 3.8 to 6.3%, with a deviation (bias) of â4.7 to 5.0% of nominal concentrations (0.1, 2.0, and 16.0 Î¼g/ml). All bioanalytical measurements were performed at the end of the study either by Novartis Pharma S.A., Rueil-Malmaison, France (for lumefantrine) or by SGS Cephac Europe, Saint-BenoÃ®t, France (for artemether and DHA).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For artemether and DHA, the higher of the two concentrations measured at 1 and 2 h after the first dose was considered to approximate the <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>. Pharmacokinetic parameters of lumefantrine were derived from the population mean concentration-time curve. This curve was constructed by averaging all concentrations available for the specified sampling intervals relative to the time of the first dose, i.e., 29 to 48 h (6 h after dose 3), 53 to 55 h (6 h after dose 5), 62 to 71 h (6 h after dose 6), 81 to 91 h (day 3), 137 to 219 h (day 7), and 324 to 450 h (day 14), and taking the mean of the actual sampling times in each interval. Population mean curves were constructed per formulation for all pediatric patients as well as for each of the three body weight groups (i.e., 5 to &lt;15 kg, 15 to &lt;25 kg, and 25 to &lt;35 kg). <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable plasma concentration (AUC<sub>0âlast</sub>) of lumefantrine were determined from the respective population mean curve by noncompartmental methods using the linear trapezoidal rule and assuming a plasma concentration of 0 at time zero.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the main study, the 28-day PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate was the primary endpoint. Pharmacodynamic/clinical endpoints used to assess potential relationships to drug levels included time to parasite clearance (PCT; time from the first dose until the first negative blood smear for at least a further 48 h), parasitological binary outcome by day 28 (classification as cure or failure on the basis of PCR genotyping to adjust for reinfections), electrocardiographic (ECG) data, and adverse event (AE) frequencies. Parasite density was determined using Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films before each intake of study medication during hospitalization and at every follow-up visit (i.e., on days 7, 14, 28, and 42 or on any other day if the child was ill). Two qualified microscopists independently read all the slides, and quality control was performed on a proportion of randomly selected slides. Blood films were considered negative if no parasites were seen in 200 oil-immersion fields in a thick blood film. A 12-lead ECG was recorded at baseline and on day 3 (6 to 10 h after the last dose). Two formulae (Bazett's and Fridericia's) were used to calculate corrected QT (QTc) intervals (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). AEs were recorded during hospitalization at the study site and at every follow-up visit.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Statistical evaluation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To explore the relationship between drug exposure and efficacy or safety, quintiles of artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (assessed after first A-L dose) and of the lumefantrine concentrations measured at approximately 6 h after dose 6 were calculated to classify the patients into 5 different exposure classes, which were then descriptively related to efficacy and/or safety variables. For artemether and DHA, these variables included PCTs of â¤24 h, &gt;24 to â¤48 h, or &gt;48 h, presence of parasitemia at day 3, and parasitological outcome at day 7. For lumefantrine, the variables were the 28-day PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate, occurrence of AEs, and QTc changes. To further explore exposure/outcome relationships, statistical models (generalized linear model or correlation model [from Statistical Analysis System software CORR Procedure]) were used whenever appropriate. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic substudy was explorative in nature; thus, no formal sample size calculation was performed. For the main study, on the basis of an expected cure rate of at least 95% for both treatments and assuming a 10% nonevaluability rate (e.g., loss of follow-up), a sample size of 890 patients (445 per treatment group) was calculated (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">As prospectively defined in the study protocol, pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically compared between treatment groups for the following reasons: (i) the <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0âlast</sub> of lumefantrine have been derived from a population mean concentration-time curve and no estimates of variability for these parameters were available, and (ii) for artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>, high interpatient variability was expected, as <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> shows an inherently larger variation than integrated characteristics such as AUC and <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> had been determined to be the larger of just two postdose concentration values. In addition, comparison of formulations with identical active ingredients based on statistical significance (<i>P</i> values) might be misleading.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-3-1"" data-type=""subjects""><h3>Patients.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 899 patients were randomized into the main study: 447 to DT (51.9% males) and 452 to CT (54.6% males), with comparable demographic and baseline characteristics between treatment groups. Mean Â± standard deviation (SD) age was 3.7 Â± 2.8 years (DT, 3.6 Â± 2.7 years; CT, 3.7 Â± 2.8 years), and mean Â± SD body weight was 14.4 Â± 5.5 kg (DT, 14.4 Â± 5.5 kg; CT, 14.5 Â± 5.5 kg). A total of 60.8% of patients fell into the 5- to &lt;15-kg body weight group, compared to 32.2% in the 15- to &lt;25-kg category and 7.0% in the 25- to &lt;35-kg group. The median parasite density was 29,241 per Î¼l (interquartile range, 10,449 to 67,587 per Î¼l; DT, 26,364 per Î¼l [interquartile range, 11,040 to 59,532 per Î¼l]; CT, 32,288 per Î¼l [interquartile range, 10,050 to 71,274 per Î¼l]) (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Approximately 90% of patients took the study medication together with a meal. The distribution of meal types was similar between the two formulations (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Artemether and DHA plasma concentrations were assessed in 91 patients receiving DT (52, 30, and 9 patients in the 5- to &lt;15-kg, 15- to &lt;25-kg, and 25- to &lt;35-kg groups, respectively) and in 93 receiving CT (56, 29, and 8 subjects in the three body weight groups, respectively). Lumefantrine plasma concentrations were available from 310 patients treated with DT and 315 patients treated with CT.</div></section><section id=""sec-3-2""><h3>Pharmacokinetic results.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The mean dose of artemether (per kg body weight) was comparable between body weight groups (<a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>). Similar <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values for artemether and DHA for the different body weight groups were obtained following treatment with DT and CT (<a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>). The overall mean Â± SD <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values for artemether (data for all weight groups pooled) following the first administration of DT and CT were 175 Â± 168 and 190 Â± 168 ng/ml, respectively; for DHA the values were 64.7 Â± 58.1 and 63.7 Â± 65.0 ng/ml, respectively. Interpatient variabilities (percent coefficient of variation) for artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> were high but within comparable ranges for DT (42 to 105%) and CT (34 to 108%).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""T1"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For lumefantrine, similar population concentration-time profiles (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>) and derived pharmacokinetic parameters (<a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>) were obtained following the two treatments. As expected, the highest concentrations were observed after the last (6th) dose of study medication (<a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>). The population <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (derived from the mean curve shown in <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>) were 6.3 and 7.7 Î¼g/ml after treatment with DT and CT, respectively. <i>T</i><sub>max</sub> was 66.3 h for both formulations. Pooled AUC<sub>0âlast</sub> values were 574 and 636 Î¼g Â· h/ml for DT and CT, respectively. When the different body weight groups were considered individually, the mean dose of lumefantrine (per kg body weight) was comparable between DT and CT, yielding similar systemic exposure to lumefantrine in both groups (<a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>). In the highest body weight group, the number of patients who contributed data for determining <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0âlast</sub> was too low to allow a reliable interpretation of results. For DT, 17 patients were subject to sparse sampling with 3 samples each available to determine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>. For CT, 19 patients participated in the sparse sampling with 1 sample each available for <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> determination. Thus, these results are not presented.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">In the population as a whole, median PCTs were almost identical between DT (34.3 h) and CT (34.9 h) groups. In the pharmacokinetic substudy, no clinically meaningful correlation was found between the artemether or DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and PCT for any of the treatments (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a>). This was supported by results of quintile analyses. Artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values were categorized into 5 quintiles (&lt;48.0, 48 to &lt;113, 113 to &lt;182, 182 to &lt;263, and â¥263 ng/ml for artemether; &lt;15.0, 15.0 to &lt;37.0, 37.0 to &lt;71.0, 71.0 to &lt;98.0, and â¥98.0 ng/ml for DHA), and the predefined efficacy variables were compared across these 5 concentration ranges. When DT and CT data were pooled, no descriptive relationship was observed between artemether or DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (after the first dose) and PCT. There was no major difference between the lowest and highest artemether concentration quintile with regard to PCT. Specifically, the percentage of patients with PCTs of â¤24 h, &gt;24 to â¤48 h, and &gt;48 h were 18.9%, 70.3%, and 10.8%, respectively, for the lowest artemether quintile and 21.6%, 73.0%, and 5.4%, respectively, for the highest quintile. For DHA these percentages were 16.7%, 75.0%, and 8.3%, respectively, for the lowest quintile and 28.6%, 62.9%, and 8.5%, respectively, for the highest quintile. For both artemether and DHA, there was no presence or persistence of asexual parasites at day 3 in any of the 5 concentration quintiles, and all patients were cured by day 7.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""F2"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Considering the entire study population, 28-day PCR-corrected cure rates were 97.8% in the DT group and 98.5% in the CT group (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Due to the very few cases of treatment failure overall and only 1 failure with plasma lumefantrine measured at 6 h after dose 6, no relationship between the lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and 28-day cure rate could be investigated using quintile analysis. Nevertheless, in those patients with treatment failure and lumefantrine levels available (DT, <i>n</i> = 3; CT, <i>n</i> = 2), there was a tendency toward lower lumefantrine concentrations (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>). However, other patients with even lower plasma concentrations were treated successfully (<a href=""#F3"">Fig. 3</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">(ii) Safety. We failed to find an association between the lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and the occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs. The mean numbers of treatment-emergent AEs were 2.9 (lowest quintile) and 1.0 (highest quintile), with malaria-related symptoms being the most commonly reported AEs.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overall, the QTc interval (Bazett's formula) from baseline to day 3 increased by less than 8 ms, specifically, by a mean of 7.6 ms (SD, 24.9 ms) in the DT group and a mean of 7.1 ms (SD, 24.3 ms) in the CT group. In the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic substudy, linear regression analysis (DT and CT data pooled) suggested a possible association between lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and QTc prolongation. The association reached statistical significance with Bazett's formula but not with Fridericia's formula (<i>P</i> = 0.036 [Bazett's formula]; <i>P</i> = 0.066 [Fridericia's formula]). In contrast, descriptive quintile analysis showed no apparent relationship between lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and the increase in QTc from baseline. The lumefantrine concentrations at 6 h after dose 6 were categorized into 5 quintiles (&lt;2.6, 2.6 to &lt;4.5, 4.5 to &lt;6.9, 6.9 to &lt;11, and â¥11.0 Î¼g/ml). The average QTc increase from baseline to day 3 was then calculated within each quintile. The pattern of QTc increases (Bazett's formula) appeared to be inconsistent across the 5 concentration quintiles (i.e., 9.8, 8.6, 6.2, 8.1, and 11.6 ms). Similar results were seen using Fridericia's formula (data not shown).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic substudy was performed within a multicenter, investigator-blinded, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a new pediatric formulation of A-L, dispersible tablet, and the tablet administered crushed in African infants and children with uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria. We acknowledge the limitations of a sparse sampling approach for lumefantrine, which allows only an approximation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Moreover, for artemether and DHA, the reported <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values were derived from 2 values only and may not accurately reflect the true <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> for these substances following oral intake of A-L DT and CT. Finally, <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> comparison is a limited description of the pharmacokinetic features of A-L DT and CT. Nevertheless, the results of our analysis suggest that the dispersible tablet and the tablet administered crushed have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics in the target population. The population plasma concentration-time profile of lumefantrine and the derived parameters <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>, and AUC<sub>0âlast</sub> were without major differences between the two treatments. Likewise, mean <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values of artemether and DHA were similar for the two A-L formulations tested. Small numerical differences are not considered clinically relevant. The latter is supported by the clinical efficacy and safety data assessed in the entire study population, which showed that the dispersible formulation was as efficacious as the tablet administered crushed and had a similar safety profile (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">This is one of the first reports of artemether and DHA exposure data in children with uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria treated with A-L. Mean artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values observed in this trial (175 and 64.7 ng/ml, respectively, for the dispersible tablet; 190 and 63.7 ng/ml, respectively, for the tablet administered crushed) were in accordance with those reported previously in adult malaria patients from Thailand treated with the 6-dose regimen of A-L tablets. These were 186 Â± 125 ng/ml for artemether and 101 Â± 58 ng/ml for DHA after the first dose of A-L (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). A recently published small study of children from Uganda assessed the pharmacokinetics of artemether and DHA after the third dose of an A-L tablet (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). The different study design limits the comparability of those pharmacokinetic results with the results of our analysis.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Moreover, the rate and extent of lumefantrine absorption assessed in our study (<i>C</i><sub>max</sub>, 6.3 and 7.7 Î¼g/ml for dispersible and crushed tablets, respectively; AUCs, 574 and 636 Î¼g Â· h/ml, respectively) were comparable to those determined in adult malaria patients from Thailand and pediatric and adult patients from Africa (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). In one study conducted in Ugandan children (26.5-kg body weight, on average), the geometric mean lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> was 6.8 Î¼g/ml and the AUC from times zero to 120 h after the last dose amounted to 195 Î¼g Â· h/ml (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). The lower AUC compared to our analysis can be explained by different sample collection protocols.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The apparent lack of a correlation between artemether and DHA <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values (after the first A-L dose) and the PCT suggests that with even low initial <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> values, the minimum effective concentration is exceeded and maximal effects are achieved rapidly. Analogous results have been reported for artesunate, another artemisinin derivative (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), where no significant relationships could be shown between parasite clearance and initial plasma concentrations of DHA or artesunate-DHA exposure (using AUC in the first 6 h). A semimechanistic model of parasite dynamics describing the early effect of artemether and DHA concentrations on the parasite density in malaria patients has recently been proposed (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In this study, we detected no relationship between lumefantrine exposure and the likelihood of parasitological cure, in particular because of few treatment failures. However, the observed lower-than-average lumefantrine concentrations in the few patients with treatment failure who had pharmacokinetic sampling are in agreement with several reports from studies in Thailand and Papua New Guinea showing that the lumefantrine plasma level is a key determinant of A-L efficacy (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The observed absence of a relationship between lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and the incidence of AEs may be explained by the fact that most commonly reported AEs were symptoms of malaria. The potential relationship between lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and QTc values was also evaluated in this study. Quintile analysis did not reveal any association, which is in accordance with previous findings showing no relationship between QTc intervals and plasma lumefantrine concentrations (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). The linear regression analysis, however, suggested a possible relation between lumefantrine <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> and QTc prolongation (<i>P</i> = 0.036 [Bazett's formula]; <i>P</i> = 0.066 [Fridericia's formula]), but the calculated <i>P</i> values should be interpreted with caution, given the exploratory nature of the pharmacokinetic assessments.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In conclusion, the new pediatric formulation of artemether-lumefantrine, dispersible tablet, appeared to provide adequate systemic exposure to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine in infants and children with uncomplicated <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">P. falciparum</span> malaria in Africa, which resulted in the desired clinical outcomes. The use of dispersible tablets may contribute to better treatment outcomes and delay the development of drug resistance.</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">The genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> comprises both the strictly pathogenic species that are transmitted by human or animal reservoirs only (<i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>M. leprae</i>) and the so-called nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (<a href=""#R3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R3"">3</a>, <a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>, <a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>). The NTM have generally been associated with soil and water, and while many of them are considered to be nonpathogenic, an increasing number are being reported as opportunistic pathogens (<a href=""#R3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R3"">3</a>, <a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>). This growing number of atypical pathogenic mycobacteria includes <i>M. abscessus</i> (<a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>), <i>M. chelonae</i> (<a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>), <i>M. fortuitum</i> (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>, <a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>), <i>M. gordonae</i> (<a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>), <i>M. mageritense</i> (<a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>), and <i>M. xenopi</i> (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>). Several NTM constitute a risk not only to immunosuppressed persons but also to otherwise healthy persons (<a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>). They can cause pulmonary and cutaneous diseases, lymphadenitis, and other infections (<a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>M. abscessus</i>, <i>M. gilvum</i>, <i>M. gordonae</i>, and <i>M. mageritense</i> have been associated with municipal water supplies (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>, <a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>, <a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). In a recent report, furunculosis, caused by <i>M. mageritense</i>, was also linked to the water supply of a salon where two women received footbaths (<a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>). In another report, cervical lymphadenitis in children below 2 years of age has been linked with mycobacteria in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia (<a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>). These infections were linked to the prevalence of <i>M. avium</i> and <i>M. scrofulaceum</i> in water (<a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>). There are also reports that NTM can be present in aerosols, such as at swimming pools and spas, of water that may contain mycobacteria and that individuals exposed to the aerosols for extended periods are more at risk of contracting an infection (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>). In the United States alone, over a million workers are exposed to aerosols generated by metal grinding, and exposure to such aerosols can lead to hypersensitivity, pneumonitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>, <a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">NTM are tolerant to a much wider pH and temperature range than are most other bacterial pathogens detected in municipal water supplies. They are also generally tolerant to chlorine, making them potentially more difficult to eliminate (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>, <a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>). Adding to this is their ability to form biofilms on surfaces in drinking water distribution systems (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>, <a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>). The growth of NTM in biofilms may lead to dissemination into the bulk water, constituting a risk to consumers both by drinking and by inhalation of aerosols though showering and swimming.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">NTM can form biofilms under low-nutrient conditions, making surfaces of drinking water distribution systems an environment for their growth and possible dissemination (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). The aim of this study was to determine the presence and diversity of NTM in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems by analyzing samples from various points in urban and semiurban areas.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Seventy-eight samples were collected from two well-serviced urban areas (Pretoria [31 samples] and Pietermaritzburg [20 samples]), a semiurban developing community (Botshabelo [5 samples]), and other towns with small distribution networks (22 samples) in South Africa. Water from the two urban areas was chloraminated, while the rest was chlorinated. Samples were collected during the period from September 2001 to August 2002. Prior to collection, water was allowed to run to waste at a uniform rate for 2 to 3 min. Water samples were collected in sterile bottles containing sodium thiosulfate to a final concentration of 0.01% (wt/vol) to neutralize any free or combined residual chlorine (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>). Following removal of the tap, biofilm samples were taken from the inner surface of the service pipe using a sterile cotton-tipped swab moistened in 1 ml of sterile one-quarter-strength Ringer's solution (Merck). The area of biofilm removed in this way was assumed to be approximately 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The swab was then returned to the Ringer's solution tube. All of the samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and analyzed within 12 to 18 h. Water from the systems was tested for the presence of fecal coliforms by filtering duplicate 100-ml volumes through 0.45-Î¼m-pore-size nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) and incubating them on mFC agar (Merck) at 44.5Â°C for 22 to 24 h. Biofilm samples were dispersed by vigorous vortexing in sterile diluent. The heterotrophic culturable count was determined for both the water and biofilm phases of the samples by plating serial dilutions (10<sup>â1</sup> to 10<sup>â5</sup> in one-quarter-strength Ringer's solution) onto R<sub>2</sub>A agar (Oxoid) and incubating them at 28Â°C for 5 days.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">NTM in biofilm samples were enumerated by a three-tube most probable number technique. Cetylpyridinium chloride (Sigma) was added to triplicate decimal dilutions of biofilm suspensions to a final concentration of 0.005% (wt/vol). The tubes were incubated at room temperature (25 Â± 2Â°C) for 30 min before 100-Î¼l aliquots were plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% oleic acid-albumin. Plates were incubated for 21 days before being scored as negative (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>). Isolates obtained were restreaked onto Middlebrook agar, and their DNA was extracted with a DNeasy tissue kit (QIAGEN).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The 16S rRNA genes of isolates were amplified by PCR using both universal primer sets 63f and 1387r (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>) and fD1 and rP2 (<a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>). PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). The nucleotide sequences were determined by sequencing on an ABI PRISM 377 or ABI Prism 3100 sequencer (Perkin Elmer) using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences were edited by Sequence Navigator (Applied Biosystems), and the relationship to known bacteria was determined by searching known sequences in GenBank using a basic BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</a> ). Sequences reduced to approximately 400-bp-long fragments corresponding to positions 170 to 566 of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> 16S rRNA genes (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R11"">11</a>) were used to draw a phylogram with Clustal X (version 1.81) (<a href=""#R25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R25"">25</a>) and viewed with TreeView (Win 32) and NJPlot (Win 95) (<a href=""#R20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R20"">20</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The heterotrophic plate counts for the analysis of the water samples ranged from 1.0 Ã 10<sup>1</sup> to 3 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> CFUâÂ·âml<sup>â1</sup> (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>), indicating a wide range of water quality. Plate counts of biofilm samples ranged from 3 Ã 10<sup>1</sup> to 2 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> CFUâÂ·âcm<sup>â2</sup> (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>), indicating that biofilms were present in all of the drinking water systems tested. Fourteen out of the 78 sites sampled, 11 of which were from Pretoria, tested positive for NTM with Middlebrook 7H10 agar. These numbers could have been even higher if a different decontamination method had been used or if samples had been incubated for a longer period (<a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>). Fourteen NTM isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and were found to be <i>M. gordonae</i> (five isolates), <i>M. gilvum</i> (five isolates), <i>M. abscessus</i> (one isolate), <i>M. fortuitum</i> (one isolate), <i>M. septicum</i> (one isolate), and one isolate that did not cluster with known species (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">No isolates appeared to belong to the <i>M. avium</i> complex, but most of the NTM isolated did belong to species with documented pathogenicity. <i>M. gordonae</i> may cause nosocomial pulmonary and systemic infections in the elderly (<a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>) and the immunosuppressed, as well as skin lesions (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). It has been reported from diverse environments, including ice machines (<a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>). <i>M. fortuitum</i> caused intractable pulmonary disease following repeated exposure to aerosols from a contaminated hot tub, as well as osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and wound infections (<a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>, <a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>). <i>M. abscessus</i> has been the cause of abscesses due to injection with medication (<a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>), and <i>M. septicum</i> has been associated with central line sepsis in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals (<a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>). <i>M. gilvum</i>, also detected in this study, has, however, not been linked to any clinical infection to date.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Fecal coliforms (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>) were detected in 6 out of 78 (7.7%) samples tested, occurring mainly in the small towns fed by boreholes (four samples) and from Pietermaritzburg (two samples). Neither fecal coliforms nor high heterotrophic counts were associated with high levels of NTM, showing that normal microbial water quality parameters do not provide any indication of the possible presence of NTM in distribution networks and the potential risk to consumers.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The findings of this study are in agreement with those conducted by Dailloux et al. (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>), Falkinham et al. (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>), and Le Dantec et al.

We would thus recommend that water authorities include sporadic testing for this group of bacteria, especially in countries or areas with a high prevalence of immunocompromised persons.</div>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00234-20","<div role=""paragraph"">By modulating the structure, diversity, and trophic outputs of microbial communities, phages play crucial roles in many biomes. In oligotrophic polar deserts, the effects of katabatic winds, constrained nutrients, and low water availability are known to limit microbial activity. Although phages may substantially govern trophic interactions in cold deserts, relatively little is known regarding the precise ecological mechanisms. Here, we provide the first evidence of widespread antiphage innate immunity in Antarctic environments using metagenomic sequence data from hypolith communities as model systems. In particular, immunity systems such as DISARM and BREX are shown to be dominant systems in these communities. Additionally, we show a direct correlation between the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity and the metavirome of hypolith communities, suggesting the existence of dynamic host-phage interactions. In addition to providing the first exploration of immune systems in cold deserts, our results suggest that phages actively challenge niche communities in Antarctic polar deserts. We provide evidence suggesting that the regulatory role played by phages in this system is an important determinant of bacterial host interactions in this environment.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antarctic terrestrial environments, including open soils, permafrost, and the surface and interior of rocks, are typically oligotrophic and dominated by psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microbial communities (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a><a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2 B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). It has been suggested that the extreme abiotic pressures of the environment, such as temperature, desiccation stress, and UV radiation, are dominant drivers of both the diversity and function of cold-adapted bacterial communities in terrestrial polar deserts (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Similarly, biotic interactions, such as competition, symbioses, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and predation, have also been shown to play a role in the distribution and diversity of microbial communities in these soil ecosystems (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">â</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The presence of viruses, including bacteriophages (henceforth termed phages), in these cold hyper-arid desert soils potentially adds an additional layer of complexity to the microbial system, but the extent to which phage-host interactions play a role in shaping community compositions and processes in cold desert soil niches remains a matter of speculation (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Hypoliths, photosynthetic assemblages found below translucent rocks, are widely distributed across hot and cold deserts (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a><a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">â</a><a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). In these arid environments, the absence of plants and larger organisms makes these niche communities, with relatively simple trophic structures, ideal systems for understanding microbial community dynamics (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). There is an increasing body of literature providing detailed insights regarding species richness, composition, and functional diversity of these communities (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>, <a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24"">â</a><a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). These studies have provided clear evidence that hypoliths are essential drivers of functional processes in deserts, including carbon and nitrogen cycling in these ecosystems (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). For instance, a recent study which reconstructed bacterial genomes from Antarctic hypoliths showed that these communities harbor xanthorhodopsin-like proteins and Na-pumping-like rhodopsins (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Yet, fundamental ecological questions regarding the role played by viruses as drivers of diversification and trophic cycling in hypoliths remain unclear.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antarctic desert hypolithic communities, in particular, have been shown to contain substantial viral populations, dominated by tailed bacteriophages of the order <i>Caudovirales</i> (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a><a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">â</a><a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Microarray analysis of lithic niches identified an even greater phage diversity, including signatures of RNA bacteriophages of the family <i>Leviviridae</i>, ssDNA phage of the family <i>Microviridae</i>, and nontailed dsDNA tectiviruses (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Together, these observations suggest that phages may play an important role in microbial community structures and functions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The presence of active bacteriophages in a microbial community inevitably leads to the evolution of specialized bacterial defensive measures (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>), and a diverse range of bacterial defense mechanisms against parasitic phages have been identified (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). These include adaptive immunity elements, such as the CRISPR-Cas systems, and innate immunity mechanisms, such as restriction-modification (RM) and toxin-antitoxin abortive infection (Abi) systems (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Recent pangenomic studies have also identified novel defense systems that are widely distributed across bacterial taxa and are thought to play a role in antiphage resistance (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a><a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37 B38"">â</a><a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). These include the bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) system, encoded by a 4 to 8 gene cluster, that provides resistance to <i>Siphoviridae</i> and <i>Myoviridae</i> tailed phages by inhibition of phage DNA replication (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), and other less well characterized systems such as the Thoeris, Shedu, and Gabija elements that increase bacterial host resistance to specific groups of phages (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Combining the valuable evidence on phage diversity and prevalence in polar desert soils, we hypothesize that phage-host interactions play an important role in shaping the structure of edaphic microbial communities in these environments. To test our hypothesis, we assess the known bacterial defense systems in metagenomic sequence data derived from a niche Antarctic hypolith community. We were able to link a portion of these data to specific phage genomes and propose that phages play an active role in shaping the immunity of Antarctic soil microbial communities.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>The distribution of antiphage defense mechanisms shows a diversity of innate immunity genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The distribution of antiphage defense systems in the metagenome was determined by mapping defense genes against the taxonomically assigned contigs. In total, 24,941 defense genes were detected, comprising 1.2% of the entire metagenome gene count. Approximately 40% of these were found in contigs attributed to unknown phyla. The general distribution of defense genes across known phyla was consistent with the relative abundance of each phylum in the metagenome (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>, <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). <i>Proteobacteria</i> harbored the highest number of antiphage genes (5,289 genes, 1.1% of total gene count for this phylum), followed by <i>Actinobacteria</i> (3,808, 0.9% of total gene count) and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (2,128, 1.08% of total contig count). RM, DISARM, and BREX systems were the most abundant systems in the metagenome, contributing 67.6% of the total gene hits for antiphage defense systems. On the other side of the spectrum, the defense systems Shedu, Hachiman, and CRISPR-type 2 were present at relatively low abundances, and therefore had little apparent contribution to the global defense system distribution. The average contribution of defense genes to the total gene count per phyla was 1.8%, with <i>Deferribacteres</i> and â<i>Candidatus</i> Tectomicrobiaâ as outliers. However, it is important to note that these phyla represent a very small portion of the metagenome, and therefore the possibility that the high percentage of defense genes is biased toward the low gene count for these phyla cannot be disregarded.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Analysis of the relative contribution of each defense system within each phylum also showed that genes belonging to the RM, DISARM, and BREX systems were the main contributors across the majority of phyla (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). The recently discovered Zorya system was predominantly represented in the phyla <i>Gemmatimonadetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Planctomycetes</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrumicrobia</i>, while CRISPR systems showed the highest contribution in <i>Cyanobacteria</i> and <i>Euryarchaeota</i>. Interestingly, noncanonical antiphage systems represented more than 50% of the defense systems identified for all phyla aside from <i>Euryarchaeota</i>, with <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>, <i>Planctomycetes</i>, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> possessing the highest distribution of noncanonical defense genes.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Innate immunity is dominated by BREX and DISARM genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As highlighted above, antiphage systems across phyla in the hypolith metagenome were dominated by noncanonical innate systems. Further analysis of the distribution of defense genes revealed that antiphage systems in the majority of phyla were dominated by BREX and DISARM genes. The two systems together accounted for 33.4% of defense genes, compared to 31.7% of genes belonging to canonical RM systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 3,758 genes for the DISARM system were identified. These included the Class I marker gene <i>drm</i>D (449 counts, 11.9% of DISARM genes), which encodes the SNF2-like helicase (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), as well as the Class II marker gene <i>drm</i>A (1,020 counts, 17.1% of DISARM genes), which encodes a protein with a putative helicase domain (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). Similarly, a total of 4,598 genes representing all BREX types were identified in the metagenome. Interestingly, the most abundant gene from this system found in the metagenome, <i>pgl</i>W (2,640 counts, 57.4% of BREX genes), which codes for a serine/threonine kinase, is specific to the type 2 BREX system, also called the Pgl system (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). By comparison, of the 7,908 RM genes found in the metagenome, the most abundant is <i>hsdM</i> (1,423 counts, 18% of RM genes), which encodes a type I DNA methylase responsible for the protection of host DNA (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). In fact, more than 50% of RM defense genes were attributed to type I RM systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The third noncanonical system representing more than 10% of the antiphage defense systems in a subset of the phyla, the Zorya system, included a total of 2,411 genes in the metagenome. The majority of these were homologous to the two genes that encode elements of a proton channel, <i>zor</i>A and <i>zor</i>B. This is a common feature in all types of Zorya system and is thought to cause depolarization of the membrane upon infection (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Type I CRISPR-<i>cas</i> genes comprise the bulk of antiphage adaptive immunity genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In total, 2,234 CRISPR-<i>cas</i> genes were identified in 1,601 contigs by searching for shared sequence similarities against the conserved domains database (CDD). A substantial proportion of all classified CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci (71.4%) belonged to type I CRISPR-Cas systems, followed by type III (18.5%) and type II (10.2%) (<a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>). While the abundance of <i>cas</i> I-B loci sequences in the public databases suggests that the Cas-I mechanism is the most common in both bacteria and archaea (20% and 30% of total CRISPR loci, respectively) (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>), less than 3% of these loci were present in our composite metagenome (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>, <a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>). Surprisingly, CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci linked to Types I-C and I-E were the most prevalent, at 24.1% and 12.9% of classified CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci, respectively. Another subtype identified at higher relative abundances than previously reported (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>) was I-U, at 10.76% of classified <i>cas</i> loci. This subtype is characterized by the marker GSU0054 domain, which was the fourth most abundant <i>cas</i> CDD overall (108 occurrences) after <i>cas4</i>, <i>cas1</i>, and <i>cas2</i>.</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Phage presence in the niche community is correlated with the CRISPR arrays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">CRISPR arrays represent the history of infection by invading DNA (e.g., phages and plasmids) (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>, <a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), and a study of their composition and frequencies provides insights into phage-host interactions in an ecological context (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). A total of 878 CRISPR arrays harboring 10,292 spacers were identified in the metagenome, with an average length of 36 protospacers per array (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1A</a>). CRISPR array sizes ranged from 2 to 249, with the majority (83.5% of total arrays) falling between 2 and 18 protospacers per array (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The distribution of CRISPR array sizes in the metagenome was compared to data collected from a groundwater microbiome (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>) to compare the array size distributions from environments with potentially different phage-host dynamics (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The results show that CRISPR arrays in the hypolith metagenome exhibited a smaller and narrower size range compared to the groundwater community metagenome (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). This suggests the existence of distinct phage infection frequencies between the different environments, i.e., with lower infection frequencies in the cold edaphic community.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">In addition to using the CRISPR array as a tool for understanding infection history, the viral population in the Antarctic soil community was also assessed by assembly of the metavirome. A total of 793 contigs was assembled from the metagenomic sequence data using VirSorter (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Taxonomic annotation of these contigs, using a database of viral reference genomes (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), unambiguously assigned 645 of these as viral, 560 of which were further assigned to the order of tailed phages, the <i>Caudovirales</i>. Within this order, the majority of contigs were assigned to <i>Siphoviridae</i> (52%), followed by unclassified <i>Caudovirales</i> (14%), and viruses with no assigned family (13%) (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a>). To access the correlation between the viral contigs and the CRISPR arrays, spacers from the metagenome were matched to both the VirSorter contigs and a set of contigs from environmental data sets (IMG/VR) (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), which allowed for the taxonomic assignment of 394 (3.8% of total number of spacers) CRISPR-<i>cas</i> spacers (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>). The resulting similarity network (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) showed that all 73 VirSorter phage contigs included in the network (red nodes) matched to CRISPR-<i>cas</i> spacers (gray nodes). This result suggests that a substantial fraction (11.3%) of the identified viral population had a history of infection <i>in situ</i> in the host population, and may therefore be actively involved in shaping the adaptive immunity of the microbial community. In addition, several distinct clusters showed matches between a single VirSorter contig and several spacers, suggesting these viral contigs are common infection agents.</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Due to the relatively simple trophic structures in cold desert systems, including Antarctic soils, cryptic microbial communities are considered to be important drivers of local ecosystem services (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). However, the extent to which these communities are influenced by phages remains largely unexplored. Such interactions may shape the diversification and community interactions in cold desert systems. Qualitative surveys of Antarctic metaviromics have reported a high diversity of viruses associated with microbial communities of open soils, and cryptic niches (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Evidence, albeit limited, that Antarctic soil phages exist predominantly in a lysogenic rather than lytic lifestyle (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) has led to suggestions that the functional role of phages in this spatially restricted, water-constrained desert soil niche may be limited (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The results presented in this study provide the first evidence of interaction between phage and hosts in this psychrophilic edaphic environment. This is most evident in the correlation between the metavirome of the hypolith community and the CRISPR-arrays, which suggest the active evolution of the adaptive immune system against local viral threats. This idea of community adaption to local phage threat is further implied by the positive correlation between the CRISPR arrays and viruses extracted from local soils. In fact, a previous study (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) has already suggested that recruitment from surrounding soils plays an important role in the development of hypoliths, and this might also be extended to the recruitment of phages from the surrounding ecosystem. Another indication of active interaction between phage and host is suggested by the presence of several methyltransferases in the metagenome-assembled viral contigs, which are a hallmark of viral evasion against native host RM systems (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Other genes found in this set of virome contigs includes genes specifically involved in the degradation of biofilm matrices and evasion against RM systems, further suggesting a complex network of interactions at play between phages and their hosts in the hypolithic environment.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While the metagenomics data analyzed in this study does not give a direct indication of the temporal scale of the phage-host interactions occurring in the hypolith, the short sizes of CRISPR-array sizes in the hypolith metagenome suggest a low frequency of infection. This low frequency is further hinted at when comparing the hypolith CRISPR-array sizes with those of a more fluid and homogenous environment, where viral-host interactions are assumed to be a frequent occurrence (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Together, these results imply a model for viral-host interactions in hypoliths that follows the âstatic-step-staticâ development model suggested by Pointing et al. (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>), driven by the stochastic and intermittent nature of rain events in such water-limited ecosystems. A surprising result from this study is the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity systems, the most prominent of which are the BREX and DISARM systems. While these two systems have been shown to be widespread in bacteria using a pangenomic data set (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>, <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), the present study represents the first evidence for the prevalence of these systems in ecological samples. As such, this result implies that noncanonical innate immunity is more important for antiphage microbial community defense than previously thought, and should therefore be the focus for future studies into innate immunity in the ecological context. There are also indications from the hypolith metagenome that the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity over traditional RM and Abi systems for defense against phages is related to the adaptation of the hypolith communities to specific local viral populations. For instance, the Zorya system, the third most prevalent noncanonical immunity system in the metagenome, is hypothesized to operate similarly to the Abi system (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). In turn, Zorya systems provide resistance against a limited range of phages, including the ssDNA family <i>Microviridae</i> (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), which has been shown to be prevalent in Antarctic aquatic and soil niches (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>Conclusion.</b> Together, these results are not consistent with the suggestion that the constraints of the environment, such as low temperatures, low a<sub>w</sub>, and resulting limited capacity for interparticle diffusion, lead to extremely localized phage-host interactions (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Rather, the data are suggestive of a dynamic and continual interaction between host and phage. Nevertheless, interparticle communication and exchange may be limited to brief periods when bulk liquid water is present, such as after snow melt, for example. Furthermore, the low metabolic rates (the inevitable consequence of Arrhenius effects [temperature dependence of reaction rates] in cold environments) should also limit the rates at which phages can replicate and propagate, further limiting the frequency of interactions with their hosts (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>). We suggest that the localized nature of host-phage interactions in the hypolith niche and the limited interparticle communication, where bacterial hosts are not frequently challenged by novel phage threats, leads to a reliance of microbial communities on innate immunity as the primary defense against phage infection. The smaller sizes of CRISPR arrays in the Antarctic soil metagenome sequences compared to those from a temperate aquatic environment, and the underrepresentation of CRISPR systems, give further credence to the temporally sporadic interaction between phages and their hosts. Nevertheless, the correlation between the metavirome and the CRIPR-<i>cas</i> arrays, together with the presence of bacteriophage evasion genes in the metavirome, suggest that phage-host interactions within the hypolith community are a dynamic process that leads to coevolution of both phages and hosts. We therefore suggest that phages play a hitherto underestimated role in driving the evolution of Antarctic soil microbial communities by shaping their collective immunity.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">The sample collection, DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing protocols used in this study have been described previously (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Briefly, a total of 50 samples were collected from hypolithic niches in the Antarctica Miers Valley (GPS 78Â°09â36.0âS 164Â°06â00.0âE) and stored in sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco International, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) at â20Â°C. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from each sample using a Power Soil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the purified DNA was pooled before further processing. Purified DNA was sheared into fragments of approximately 300 bp and further purified from 1% agarose gels.

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In Antarctic environments, the combination of both abiotic and biotic stressors results in simple trophic levels dominated by microbiomes. Although the past two decades have revealed substantial insights regarding the diversity and structure of microbiomes, we lack mechanistic insights regarding community interactions and how phages may affect these. By providing the first evidence of widespread antiphage innate immunity, we shed light on phage-host dynamics in Antarctic niche communities. Our analyses reveal several antiphage defense systems, including DISARM and BREX, which appear to dominate in cold desert niche communities. In contrast, our analyses revealed that genes which encode antiphage adaptive immunity were underrepresented in these communities, suggesting lower infection frequencies in cold edaphic environments. We propose that by actively challenging niche communities, phages play crucial roles in the diversification of Antarctic communities.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antarctic terrestrial environments, including open soils, permafrost, and the surface and interior of rocks, are typically oligotrophic and dominated by psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microbial communities (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a><a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2 B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). It has been suggested that the extreme abiotic pressures of the environment, such as temperature, desiccation stress, and UV radiation, are dominant drivers of both the diversity and function of cold-adapted bacterial communities in terrestrial polar deserts (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Similarly, biotic interactions, such as competition, symbioses, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and predation, have also been shown to play a role in the distribution and diversity of microbial communities in these soil ecosystems (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a><a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">â</a><a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). The presence of viruses, including bacteriophages (henceforth termed phages), in these cold hyper-arid desert soils potentially adds an additional layer of complexity to the microbial system, but the extent to which phage-host interactions play a role in shaping community compositions and processes in cold desert soil niches remains a matter of speculation (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Hypoliths, photosynthetic assemblages found below translucent rocks, are widely distributed across hot and cold deserts (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a><a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">â</a><a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). In these arid environments, the absence of plants and larger organisms makes these niche communities, with relatively simple trophic structures, ideal systems for understanding microbial community dynamics (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). There is an increasing body of literature providing detailed insights regarding species richness, composition, and functional diversity of these communities (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>, <a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24"">â</a><a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). These studies have provided clear evidence that hypoliths are essential drivers of functional processes in deserts, including carbon and nitrogen cycling in these ecosystems (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>, <a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). For instance, a recent study which reconstructed bacterial genomes from Antarctic hypoliths showed that these communities harbor xanthorhodopsin-like proteins and Na-pumping-like rhodopsins (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Yet, fundamental ecological questions regarding the role played by viruses as drivers of diversification and trophic cycling in hypoliths remain unclear.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antarctic desert hypolithic communities, in particular, have been shown to contain substantial viral populations, dominated by tailed bacteriophages of the order <i>Caudovirales</i> (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a><a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">â</a><a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). Microarray analysis of lithic niches identified an even greater phage diversity, including signatures of RNA bacteriophages of the family <i>Leviviridae</i>, ssDNA phage of the family <i>Microviridae</i>, and nontailed dsDNA tectiviruses (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Together, these observations suggest that phages may play an important role in microbial community structures and functions.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The presence of active bacteriophages in a microbial community inevitably leads to the evolution of specialized bacterial defensive measures (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>), and a diverse range of bacterial defense mechanisms against parasitic phages have been identified (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). These include adaptive immunity elements, such as the CRISPR-Cas systems, and innate immunity mechanisms, such as restriction-modification (RM) and toxin-antitoxin abortive infection (Abi) systems (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). Recent pangenomic studies have also identified novel defense systems that are widely distributed across bacterial taxa and are thought to play a role in antiphage resistance (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a><a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37 B38"">â</a><a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). These include the bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) system, encoded by a 4 to 8 gene cluster, that provides resistance to <i>Siphoviridae</i> and <i>Myoviridae</i> tailed phages by inhibition of phage DNA replication (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), and other less well characterized systems such as the Thoeris, Shedu, and Gabija elements that increase bacterial host resistance to specific groups of phages (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Combining the valuable evidence on phage diversity and prevalence in polar desert soils, we hypothesize that phage-host interactions play an important role in shaping the structure of edaphic microbial communities in these environments. To test our hypothesis, we assess the known bacterial defense systems in metagenomic sequence data derived from a niche Antarctic hypolith community. We were able to link a portion of these data to specific phage genomes and propose that phages play an active role in shaping the immunity of Antarctic soil microbial communities.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>The distribution of antiphage defense mechanisms shows a diversity of innate immunity genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The distribution of antiphage defense systems in the metagenome was determined by mapping defense genes against the taxonomically assigned contigs. In total, 24,941 defense genes were detected, comprising 1.2% of the entire metagenome gene count. Approximately 40% of these were found in contigs attributed to unknown phyla. The general distribution of defense genes across known phyla was consistent with the relative abundance of each phylum in the metagenome (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>, <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>). <i>Proteobacteria</i> harbored the highest number of antiphage genes (5,289 genes, 1.1% of total gene count for this phylum), followed by <i>Actinobacteria</i> (3,808, 0.9% of total gene count) and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (2,128, 1.08% of total contig count). RM, DISARM, and BREX systems were the most abundant systems in the metagenome, contributing 67.6% of the total gene hits for antiphage defense systems. On the other side of the spectrum, the defense systems Shedu, Hachiman, and CRISPR-type 2 were present at relatively low abundances, and therefore had little apparent contribution to the global defense system distribution. The average contribution of defense genes to the total gene count per phyla was 1.8%, with <i>Deferribacteres</i> and â<i>Candidatus</i> Tectomicrobiaâ as outliers. However, it is important to note that these phyla represent a very small portion of the metagenome, and therefore the possibility that the high percentage of defense genes is biased toward the low gene count for these phyla cannot be disregarded.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">Analysis of the relative contribution of each defense system within each phylum also showed that genes belonging to the RM, DISARM, and BREX systems were the main contributors across the majority of phyla (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). The recently discovered Zorya system was predominantly represented in the phyla <i>Gemmatimonadetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Planctomycetes</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrumicrobia</i>, while CRISPR systems showed the highest contribution in <i>Cyanobacteria</i> and <i>Euryarchaeota</i>. Interestingly, noncanonical antiphage systems represented more than 50% of the defense systems identified for all phyla aside from <i>Euryarchaeota</i>, with <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>, <i>Planctomycetes</i>, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> possessing the highest distribution of noncanonical defense genes.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Innate immunity is dominated by BREX and DISARM genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">As highlighted above, antiphage systems across phyla in the hypolith metagenome were dominated by noncanonical innate systems. Further analysis of the distribution of defense genes revealed that antiphage systems in the majority of phyla were dominated by BREX and DISARM genes. The two systems together accounted for 33.4% of defense genes, compared to 31.7% of genes belonging to canonical RM systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A total of 3,758 genes for the DISARM system were identified. These included the Class I marker gene <i>drm</i>D (449 counts, 11.9% of DISARM genes), which encodes the SNF2-like helicase (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), as well as the Class II marker gene <i>drm</i>A (1,020 counts, 17.1% of DISARM genes), which encodes a protein with a putative helicase domain (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). Similarly, a total of 4,598 genes representing all BREX types were identified in the metagenome. Interestingly, the most abundant gene from this system found in the metagenome, <i>pgl</i>W (2,640 counts, 57.4% of BREX genes), which codes for a serine/threonine kinase, is specific to the type 2 BREX system, also called the Pgl system (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). By comparison, of the 7,908 RM genes found in the metagenome, the most abundant is <i>hsdM</i> (1,423 counts, 18% of RM genes), which encodes a type I DNA methylase responsible for the protection of host DNA (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>). In fact, more than 50% of RM defense genes were attributed to type I RM systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The third noncanonical system representing more than 10% of the antiphage defense systems in a subset of the phyla, the Zorya system, included a total of 2,411 genes in the metagenome. The majority of these were homologous to the two genes that encode elements of a proton channel, <i>zor</i>A and <i>zor</i>B. This is a common feature in all types of Zorya system and is thought to cause depolarization of the membrane upon infection (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Type I CRISPR-<i>cas</i> genes comprise the bulk of antiphage adaptive immunity genes.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In total, 2,234 CRISPR-<i>cas</i> genes were identified in 1,601 contigs by searching for shared sequence similarities against the conserved domains database (CDD). A substantial proportion of all classified CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci (71.4%) belonged to type I CRISPR-Cas systems, followed by type III (18.5%) and type II (10.2%) (<a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>). While the abundance of <i>cas</i> I-B loci sequences in the public databases suggests that the Cas-I mechanism is the most common in both bacteria and archaea (20% and 30% of total CRISPR loci, respectively) (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>), less than 3% of these loci were present in our composite metagenome (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>, <a href=""#tabS2"">TableÂ S2</a>). Surprisingly, CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci linked to Types I-C and I-E were the most prevalent, at 24.1% and 12.9% of classified CRISPR-<i>cas</i> loci, respectively. Another subtype identified at higher relative abundances than previously reported (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>) was I-U, at 10.76% of classified <i>cas</i> loci. This subtype is characterized by the marker GSU0054 domain, which was the fourth most abundant <i>cas</i> CDD overall (108 occurrences) after <i>cas4</i>, <i>cas1</i>, and <i>cas2</i>.</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Phage presence in the niche community is correlated with the CRISPR arrays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">CRISPR arrays represent the history of infection by invading DNA (e.g., phages and plasmids) (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>, <a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), and a study of their composition and frequencies provides insights into phage-host interactions in an ecological context (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). A total of 878 CRISPR arrays harboring 10,292 spacers were identified in the metagenome, with an average length of 36 protospacers per array (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1A</a>). CRISPR array sizes ranged from 2 to 249, with the majority (83.5% of total arrays) falling between 2 and 18 protospacers per array (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The distribution of CRISPR array sizes in the metagenome was compared to data collected from a groundwater microbiome (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>) to compare the array size distributions from environments with potentially different phage-host dynamics (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The results show that CRISPR arrays in the hypolith metagenome exhibited a smaller and narrower size range compared to the groundwater community metagenome (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3</a>). This suggests the existence of distinct phage infection frequencies between the different environments, i.e., with lower infection frequencies in the cold edaphic community.</div>

</div></aside><div role=""paragraph"">In addition to using the CRISPR array as a tool for understanding infection history, the viral population in the Antarctic soil community was also assessed by assembly of the metavirome. A total of 793 contigs was assembled from the metagenomic sequence data using VirSorter (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Taxonomic annotation of these contigs, using a database of viral reference genomes (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), unambiguously assigned 645 of these as viral, 560 of which were further assigned to the order of tailed phages, the <i>Caudovirales</i>. Within this order, the majority of contigs were assigned to <i>Siphoviridae</i> (52%), followed by unclassified <i>Caudovirales</i> (14%), and viruses with no assigned family (13%) (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a>). To access the correlation between the viral contigs and the CRISPR arrays, spacers from the metagenome were matched to both the VirSorter contigs and a set of contigs from environmental data sets (IMG/VR) (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), which allowed for the taxonomic assignment of 394 (3.8% of total number of spacers) CRISPR-<i>cas</i> spacers (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>). The resulting similarity network (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4</a>) showed that all 73 VirSorter phage contigs included in the network (red nodes) matched to CRISPR-<i>cas</i> spacers (gray nodes). This result suggests that a substantial fraction (11.3%) of the identified viral population had a history of infection <i>in situ</i> in the host population, and may therefore be actively involved in shaping the adaptive immunity of the microbial community. In addition, several distinct clusters showed matches between a single VirSorter contig and several spacers, suggesting these viral contigs are common infection agents.</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Due to the relatively simple trophic structures in cold desert systems, including Antarctic soils, cryptic microbial communities are considered to be important drivers of local ecosystem services (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). However, the extent to which these communities are influenced by phages remains largely unexplored. Such interactions may shape the diversification and community interactions in cold desert systems. Qualitative surveys of Antarctic metaviromics have reported a high diversity of viruses associated with microbial communities of open soils, and cryptic niches (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Evidence, albeit limited, that Antarctic soil phages exist predominantly in a lysogenic rather than lytic lifestyle (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) has led to suggestions that the functional role of phages in this spatially restricted, water-constrained desert soil niche may be limited (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The results presented in this study provide the first evidence of interaction between phage and hosts in this psychrophilic edaphic environment. This is most evident in the correlation between the metavirome of the hypolith community and the CRISPR-arrays, which suggest the active evolution of the adaptive immune system against local viral threats. This idea of community adaption to local phage threat is further implied by the positive correlation between the CRISPR arrays and viruses extracted from local soils. In fact, a previous study (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) has already suggested that recruitment from surrounding soils plays an important role in the development of hypoliths, and this might also be extended to the recruitment of phages from the surrounding ecosystem. Another indication of active interaction between phage and host is suggested by the presence of several methyltransferases in the metagenome-assembled viral contigs, which are a hallmark of viral evasion against native host RM systems (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Other genes found in this set of virome contigs includes genes specifically involved in the degradation of biofilm matrices and evasion against RM systems, further suggesting a complex network of interactions at play between phages and their hosts in the hypolithic environment.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">While the metagenomics data analyzed in this study does not give a direct indication of the temporal scale of the phage-host interactions occurring in the hypolith, the short sizes of CRISPR-array sizes in the hypolith metagenome suggest a low frequency of infection. This low frequency is further hinted at when comparing the hypolith CRISPR-array sizes with those of a more fluid and homogenous environment, where viral-host interactions are assumed to be a frequent occurrence (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Together, these results imply a model for viral-host interactions in hypoliths that follows the âstatic-step-staticâ development model suggested by Pointing et al. (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>), driven by the stochastic and intermittent nature of rain events in such water-limited ecosystems. A surprising result from this study is the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity systems, the most prominent of which are the BREX and DISARM systems. While these two systems have been shown to be widespread in bacteria using a pangenomic data set (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>, <a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>), the present study represents the first evidence for the prevalence of these systems in ecological samples. As such, this result implies that noncanonical innate immunity is more important for antiphage microbial community defense than previously thought, and should therefore be the focus for future studies into innate immunity in the ecological context. There are also indications from the hypolith metagenome that the prevalence of noncanonical innate immunity over traditional RM and Abi systems for defense against phages is related to the adaptation of the hypolith communities to specific local viral populations. For instance, the Zorya system, the third most prevalent noncanonical immunity system in the metagenome, is hypothesized to operate similarly to the Abi system (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). In turn, Zorya systems provide resistance against a limited range of phages, including the ssDNA family <i>Microviridae</i> (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), which has been shown to be prevalent in Antarctic aquatic and soil niches (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>Conclusion.</b> Together, these results are not consistent with the suggestion that the constraints of the environment, such as low temperatures, low a<sub>w</sub>, and resulting limited capacity for interparticle diffusion, lead to extremely localized phage-host interactions (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). Rather, the data are suggestive of a dynamic and continual interaction between host and phage. Nevertheless, interparticle communication and exchange may be limited to brief periods when bulk liquid water is present, such as after snow melt, for example. Furthermore, the low metabolic rates (the inevitable consequence of Arrhenius effects [temperature dependence of reaction rates] in cold environments) should also limit the rates at which phages can replicate and propagate, further limiting the frequency of interactions with their hosts (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>). We suggest that the localized nature of host-phage interactions in the hypolith niche and the limited interparticle communication, where bacterial hosts are not frequently challenged by novel phage threats, leads to a reliance of microbial communities on innate immunity as the primary defense against phage infection. The smaller sizes of CRISPR arrays in the Antarctic soil metagenome sequences compared to those from a temperate aquatic environment, and the underrepresentation of CRISPR systems, give further credence to the temporally sporadic interaction between phages and their hosts. Nevertheless, the correlation between the metavirome and the CRIPR-<i>cas</i> arrays, together with the presence of bacteriophage evasion genes in the metavirome, suggest that phage-host interactions within the hypolith community are a dynamic process that leads to coevolution of both phages and hosts. We therefore suggest that phages play a hitherto underestimated role in driving the evolution of Antarctic soil microbial communities by shaping their collective immunity.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-4-1""><h3>Sample collection, DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The sample collection, DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing protocols used in this study have been described previously (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Briefly, a total of 50 samples were collected from hypolithic niches in the Antarctica Miers Valley (GPS 78Â°09â36.0âS 164Â°06â00.0âE) and stored in sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco International, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) at â20Â°C. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from each sample using a Power Soil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the purified DNA was pooled before further processing. Purified DNA was sheared into fragments of approximately 300 bp and further purified from 1% agarose gels. Subsequent sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq-2000 paired-end technology (2âÃâ101âbp), and the resulting reads were trimmed and assembled as described below.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-2""><h3>Metagenome assembly and taxonomical annotation.</h3>

By RNA deep sequencing, we determined the Zur and SmtB regulons of MSMEG and compared them with transcriptional responses after zinc starvation or excess. We found an exceptional genomic clustering of genes whose expression was strongly induced by <i>zur</i> deletion and zinc starvation. These genes encoded zinc importers such as ZnuABC and three additional putative zinc transporters, including the porin MspD, as well as alternative ribosomal proteins. In contrast, only a few genes were affected by deletion of <i>smtB</i> and zinc excess. The zinc exporter ZitA was most prominently regulated by SmtB. Moreover, transcriptional analyses in combination with promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a special regulation of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon itself: an apparently zinc-independent, constitutive expression of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> resulted from sensitive coregulation by both SmtB and Zur.

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">In living eukaryotic and bacterial cells, zinc plays an essential role in numerous cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, DNA binding, and many enzymatic reactions (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Thus, it is essential for the survival of eukaryotes and bacteria. However, as with iron and copper, the bioavailability of zinc is very low (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Hence, depending on their environmental niches, bacteria are exposed to various zinc concentrations (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Zinc (and other trace metals) also play a role in innate immunity. For example, macrophages can actively fend off bacterial infection by increasing or depleting zinc, thereby causing either intoxication or starvation of the bacteria (nutritional immunity) (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Therefore, in the environment as well as in the host, bacteria need mechanisms to efficiently regulate zinc homeostasis. Zinc homeostasis is achieved by the expression of regulated or nonregulated, specific or nonspecific, energy-dependent or -independent systems. Cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs), such as CzcD of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</span> (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) and ZitB of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), allow regulated, specific, ATP-independent uptake or efflux (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), whereas the activity of specific low-affinity zinc importers of the ZIP family, e.g., ZupT of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), or high-affinity transporters such as P<sub>1</sub>-type ATPases, e.g., ZntA of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>) and CtpC of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (MTB) (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>), is mostly ATP dependent (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). The most prominent family of inducible high-affinity bacterial zinc transporters is the common ATP binding cassette (ABC) importer ZnuABC, which is an important virulence factor in many bacteria, e.g., <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Salmonella enterica</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Campylobacter jejuni</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Yersinia pestis</span> (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a><a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15 B16 B17 B18"">â</a><a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bacteria are able to sense alterations of intracellular zinc concentration in the femtomolar range by zinc-responsive regulators (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). They regulate the expression of zinc uptake, export, or storage systems. Examples include DtxR (<span data-style=""underline"">d</span>iphtheria <span data-style=""underline"">t</span>o<span data-style=""underline"">x</span>in <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like regulators such as TroR of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Treponema pallidum</span>, MerR (<span data-style=""underline"">me</span>tal-<span data-style=""underline"">r</span>esponsive <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like regulators such as ZntR of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, and ArsR (<span data-style=""underline"">ar</span>senite-<span data-style=""underline"">s</span>ensitive <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like repressors such as SmtB of <i>Synechococcus</i> species and CzrA of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, and Zur (<span data-style=""underline"">z</span>inc <span data-style=""underline"">u</span>ptake <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator, also known as FurB) of MTB, a member of the Fur (<span data-style=""underline"">f</span>erric <span data-style=""underline"">u</span>ptake <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator) family (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22 B23 B24 B25"">â</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Knowledge of zinc homeostasis and its regulation in mycobacteria is very limited. Most information concerning pathogenic species is based on heterologous studies in the nonpathogenic <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium smegmatis</span> (MSMEG). These studies indicate that the antagonistically acting repressors SmtB and Zur regulate zinc homeostasis by using zinc as a cofactor (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). Thereby they regulate bacterial responses to changing intracellular zinc availability by activating or repressing the expression of importer or exporter genes. During starvation, apo-Zur is released from the DNA, allowing zinc import by derepression of zinc importer genes such as MTB <i>znuABC</i> and <i>yciC</i> (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Similar activity of Zur was observed in the ruminant pathogen <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium avium</span> subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i> (MAP) (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Holo-SmtB detaches from the DNA when zinc is in excess, thereby allowing gene transcription of zinc exporters such as ZitA of MTB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). Zinc-dependent regulation of <i>smtB</i> expression has been demonstrated for MTB and MAP (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). In these species, SmtB has been shown to be cotranscribed with Zur from an operon (here referred to as <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i>) which seems to be autoregulated by SmtB (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Cotranscription and autoregulation has also been proposed for MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>), suggesting a general regulation concept of the operon in mycobacteria.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Little is known about the influence of zinc on gene expression in mycobacteria. The regulons of MTB Zur and the zinc starvation regulon of MAP have been identified (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). These studies revealed a Zur-dependent and zinc starvation-dependent induction of a set of genes, which encode alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs). ARPs, in contrast to their zinc-containing paralogues, do not use zinc as a structural component. In addition, the virulence-associated mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX-3, the zinc importer <i>znuABC</i>, and CobW-like chaperones were all induced upon Zur deletion or zinc starvation (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). However, direct involvement of Zur in regulation was based on binding site predictions only and was not experimentally confirmed (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Knowledge of the role of SmtB in zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria is limited to prediction of its binding site in MTB and studies of its promoter in MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In nonpathogenic mycobacteria, e.g., MSMEG, very few studies have been published on zinc homeostasis. These include the presence of a <i>zitA</i> homologue (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), the zinc-dependent DNA repair protein KU, which is important for zinc resistance (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), and the involvement of mycobacterial protein Y (MPY) in the hibernation of alternative ribosomes (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the present study, we applied a comprehensive transcriptional approach to investigate the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon of mycobacteria in the context of MSMEG responses to zinc starvation and excess as well as the regulons of SmtB and Zur. Our results provide novel insights into zinc-dependent gene regulation in MSMEG and reveal additional putative zinc transport systems. Moreover, we demonstrated the relevance of SmtB and Zur during zinc stress and starvation and characterized details of their own regulation. The results indicate that the regulation of zinc homeostasis in MSMEG is more complex than that in pathogenic mycobacteria. Overall, we provide novel findings which contribute to our understanding of mycobacterial responses to changing zinc concentrations.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>The <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon structure is conserved in mycobacteria.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Regulation of zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria is achieved by the antagonistic activity of the regulators SmtB and Zur (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). These regulators are also present in other bacterial genera, but, in contrast to mycobacteria, they are encoded on separate genes which are not organized in an operon. Hence, we were interested in whether this organization is specific for mycobacteria. We performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> of MSMEG in NCBI BLASTN and subsequent neighborhood joining analysis. Of the 42 strains harboring the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon, 39 were mycobacterial strains. They could be grouped into mainly environmental/nonpathogenic and mainly pathogenic species. The remaining three strains were genera of the phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, e.g., <i>Nocardia</i> species and <i>Saccharothrix</i> species (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). Furthermore, an operon was also found in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</span> but with significantly lower sequence homology (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). Thus, the arrangement of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> on an operon as present in mycobacteria is otherwise observed only in a very small group of actinobacteria. Operon structure was confirmed in selected species by extracting the genome regions homologous to MSMEG <i>zur</i> and <i>smtB</i> and by performing multiple sequence alignments. The coding sequences homologous to <i>zur</i> and <i>smtB</i> are overlapping in MSMEG, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium thermoresistibile</span>, MTB, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Saccharothrix espanaensis</span>. In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Nocardia asteroides</span>, the two coding sequences are separated by 4 bp (see <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> in the supplemental material).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Zur and SmtB contribute to zinc resistance in MSMEG.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To get more insight into the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis of MSMEG, we determined their regulons. For this, we used the previously published regulator mutant MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) and generated the deletion mutants MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎs<i>mtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> as well as the complemented strains MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>Î<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Mutation, complementation, and polar effects on the adjacent gene MSMEG_4488 were controlled by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>). As expected, <i>smtB</i> expression was abolished in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> but still present in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>. Vice versa, expression of <i>zur</i> was observed in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> but was not detectable in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> or MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i>. Interestingly, expression of <i>smtB</i> was higher in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> and expression of <i>zur</i> was higher in MSMEGÎs<i>mtB</i> than in the wild type, suggesting that both regulators contribute to their own expression. Complementation restored the wild-type phenotype; mRNA expression of the respective genes on the integrated complementation vector was higher in the complemented strains than in the wild type. The adjacent gene, MSMEG_4488, was expressed in all mutated strains (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Growth kinetics of all strains were monitored in standard MB (see Materials and Methods). Growth of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and the double mutant MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> was comparable to that of the wild type (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">C</a>). Only MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> showed a significantly reduced growth and had entered the stationary phase already after 27 h. Complementation restored the wild-type phenotype (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>). To analyze differences in zinc tolerance of the different mutants, we used a plating assay with increasing zinc concentrations. Briefly, strains were spread on agar and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was applied to filter discs in increasing concentrations. No growth inhibition was visible with water control. At low ZnSO<sub>4</sub> concentrations (25âmM), growth of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> was significantly impaired, as indicated by a larger zone of growth inhibition (ZoI), which was not observed for wild-type MSMEG (MSMEGwt) and the complemented strains (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2D</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">E</a>). The double mutant showed significantly reduced growth at higher concentrations (50 or 100âmM) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2F</a>). Hence, all mutants were affected in growth, most likely by impaired abilities to maintain zinc homeostasis.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Responses of MSMEG to changes in zinc homeostasis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The above-described data suggest an involvement of SmtB and Zur in control of zinc homeostasis. To further dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed the transcriptional response of MSMEGwt cultures treated with the zinc chelator TPEN [<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>Nâ²</i>,<i>Nâ²</i>-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine] (10âÎ¼M) or exposed to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (500âÎ¼M). Gene expression was determined by RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the transcriptome of MSMEG treated with TPEN or exposed to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was compared to that of the untreated control.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Zinc starvation upon TPEN treatment resulted in the differential expression of 58 genes (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>), which are organized in 10 operons (as predicted by Rockhopper analysis). Higher expression was observed for 26 genes and lower expression for 32 genes. More than 60% of the differentially expressed genes exhibited 4- to 7-fold changes. These genes encode proteins involved in energy conversion (MSMEG_1768, MSMEG_3541), transport (MSMEG_2925), gene regulation (MSMEG_1769), and stress and immune responses (MSMEG_3945, MSMEG_5617). Others are involved in metabolic and enzymatic processes (MSMEG_0115, MSMEG_0117, MSMEG_0266, MSMEG_0280, MSMEG_0684, MSMEG_1097, MSMEG_1155, MSMEG_1156, MSMEG_2343, MSMEG_2913, MSMEG_3304, MSMEG_3785, MSMEG_3929, MSMEG_5616, MSMEG_6071, MSMEG_6664) or are of unknown function (MSMEG_0669, MSMEG_0672, MSMEG_1767, MSMEG_1774, MSMEG_1781, MSMEG_1802, MSMEG_1951, MSMEG_2958, MSMEG_5154, MSMEG_6211, MSMEG_6610, MSMEG_6615, MSMEG_6728).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differentially expressed genes with a fold change of â¥7 comprised the genes MSMEG_5406 and MSMEG_6237 (encoding hypothetical proteins) and a special cluster of genes, MSMEG_6045-6071, which was more highly expressed after zinc starvation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>). This cluster comprised genes encoding four putative transporters (MSMEG_6049-6051, MSMEG_6052, MSMEG_6058-6059), including the common ZnuABC transporter (MSMEG_6045-6047), two CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_6048 and MSMEG_6069), the latter representing the recently described mycobacterium-specific protein Y (MPY) recruitment factor (MRF) (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>), a set of genes encoding zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs) RpsR, RpsN, RpmG, RpmB, and RpmE2 (MSMEG_6065, MSMEG_6066, MSMEG_6067, MSMEG_6068, MSMEG_6070), a gene encoding the porin MspD (MSMEG_6057), and two genes of unknown function (MSMEG_6055, MSMEG_6064). In addition, â¥7-fold-lower expression upon TPEN treatment was observed for the cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance gene MSMEG_0755. The encoded protein belongs to the group of CDF transporters, is closely related to the P<sub>1B</sub>-type ATPase CzcD (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), and is a putative homologue of the zinc exporter ZitA (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">MSMEG responded to zinc excess by differential expression of only 20 genes, i.e., 13 with higher expression and 7 with lower expression, compared to the untreated control (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>). They are predicted to be involved in transcription/regulation (MSMEG_6292, MSMEG_6764, MSMEG_6903), metabolic or enzymatic processes (MSMEG_6664, MSMEG_6904), stress response (MSMEG_1392, MSMEG_5117, MSMEG_6242), and (metal) transport (MSMEG_0755, MSMEG_1530, MSMEG_5014, MSMEG_5418) or are of unknown function (MSMEG_0230, MSMEG_0689, MSMEG_3323, MSMEG_3325, MSMEG_5015, MSMEG_5016, MSMEG_5549, MSMEG_6237). Moreover, the expression of MSMEG_6903 and MSMEG_6904 was reduced upon zinc addition. These genes encode a PadR family transcription regulator and a synthase involved in myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) generation, respectively. The MIP protein has been shown to form a complex with zinc (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). Within the group of genes with higher expression, we found a gene cluster putatively involved in zinc transport (MSMEG_5014-5016) and a proline dehydrogenase (MSMEG_5117). However, the most prominently affected gene of the zinc stress transcriptome was MSMEG_0755, which was strongly induced upon zinc excess and, as shown above, had lower expression upon zinc starvation (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). This supports the hypothesis that MSMEG_0755 is involved in zinc export.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab2"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overall, the MSMEG response to zinc limitation involved a large number of genes associated with zinc homeostasis. The response to zinc excess, however, was less pronounced, as it caused only moderate changes in gene expression, and most of these genes could not be assigned to zinc homeostasis.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>SmtB and Zur control zinc homeostasis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To dissect the relevance of MSMEG SmtB and Zur for zinc homeostasis, we determined the regulons of both regulators by RNA sequencing of the respective mutants and the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant. Differentially expressed genes were compared with those of zinc starvation and stress regulons to determine the zinc dependency of SmtB/Zur-regulated genes.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Transcriptome analysis of the MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> mutant revealed 46 differentially expressed genes compared to MSMEGwt. Differential expression of 25 of these genes was congruent with the TPEN or zinc stress transcriptome (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">C</a>). They were classified as Zur and zinc dependently regulated genes (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). The remaining 21 genes were considered Zur dependent but zinc independently regulated (<a href=""#tab4"">TableÂ 4</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab4"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the group of zinc-dependent genes, which were all but four more highly expressed in the mutant than in the wild type, we found several extremely highly induced genes (&gt;100- to 5,000-fold change). These included genes encoding ARPs (MSMEG_6065-6068 and MSMEG_6070), as well as two genes coding for CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6069) and a putative ABC transporter (MSMEG_6049-6051). In addition, a number of genes encoding other predicted cation transporters (MSMEG_6052, MSMEG_6058-6059), the predicted ZnuABC importer (MSMEG_6045-6047), the porin MspD (MSMEG_6057) as well as three genes of unknown function (MSMEG_6064, MSMEG_6071, MSMEG_6237) and one coding for a methyltransferase (MSMEG_6055) were classified as Zur and zinc dependent.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The majority of zinc-independent genes differentially expressed in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> showed only weak differences in expression compared to the wild type. However, we found some interesting clusters, e.g., one encoding a group of chaperones (MSMEG_0880, MSMEG_1582, MSMEG_1583) and one an iron uptake system (MSMEG_6062-6063), which were more highly expressed in the mutant, whereas gene clusters involved in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (MSMEG_3787-3789), ectoine synthesis (expressed at higher salt concentrations) (MSMEG_3898-3901), and other metabolic pathways (MSMEG_0584, MSMEG_5021, MSMEG_5022, MSMEG_6239-6242) showed reduced expression compared to the wild type.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two genes were highly affected by <i>zur</i> deletion but were zinc independent: expression of MSMEG_4486 (<i>smtB</i>) was â¼95-fold increased and transcription of MSMEG_4596, coding for a putative LppH protein, was strongly repressed (â¼116-fold). The function of the latter gene is unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The SmtB regulon was relatively small. Overall, only 12 genes were differentially expressed. Of these, only five belonged exclusively to the SmtB regulon (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; <a href=""#tab5"">TableÂ 5</a>). Five genes were also present in the Zur regulon. Two genes were SmtB and zinc dependent (MSMEG_5117, MSMEG_0755). Only the expression of the cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance gene MSMEG_0755 was affected by <i>smtB</i> deletion and TPEN and zinc treatment. While its expression was decreased (â¼34-fold) upon zinc starvation and induced (â¼14-fold) upon zinc excess, <i>smtB</i> deletion resulted in an â¼80-fold increase of expression. In the group of zinc-independent genes, we found two poorly characterized transcriptional regulator genes (MSMEG_3959, MSMEG_3960), <i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4487), one gene involved in metabolism (MSMEG_2659), and a gene encoding a protein of the ferritin family (MSMEG_6422). All these genes were more highly expressed in the mutant.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab5"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We then compared the Zur and SmtB regulons with the transcriptome of the MSMEG<i>ÎsmtBÎzur</i> double mutant. Among 81 differentially expressed genes in MSMEG<i>ÎsmtBÎzur</i> (see <a href=""#tabS3"">TableÂ S3</a> in the supplemental material) with a &gt;4-fold change, expression of 42 genes was congruent with genes of the single mutant regulons (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). Hence, expression of 79% of the genes regulated by Zur and SmtB (42 of 53 differentially expressed genes in total) was also affected in the double mutant. The 39 remaining genes could be assigned mostly to metabolism and stress response, possibly due to the metal imbalance, and are regulated by other regulators.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Prediction and distribution of Zur and SmtB binding motifs in MSMEG.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To emphasize the direct involvement of SmtB and Zur in regulation, we were next interested in identification of putative binding motifs in the regulatory elements of regulated genes. We screened the MSMEG genome for putative SmtB and Zur binding sites by use of the MEME Suite and subsequent FIMO analysis. Due to the complex architecture of mycobacterial promoters, which can extend up to 2âkb (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>), and the possible presence of more than one functional Zur box upstream of genes (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), we considered motifs which were found in the 5â² untranslated region (UTR) up to â350âbp upstream of predicted open reading frames (ORFs) as putative binding sites. Of 46 motifs for Zur, 23 were found in the chosen 5â² UTR of ORFs (<a href=""#tab6"">TableÂ 6</a>). Among those, we found 12 motifs located in the promoter-operator region of Zur-regulated genes (<a href=""#tab6"">TableÂ 6</a>, indicated by boldface, and <a href=""#tab3"">TablesÂ 3</a> and <a href=""#tab4"">4</a>, indicated by asterisks), i.e., the predicted ZnuABC transporter (MSMEG_6045-6047) and a second ABC transporter (MSMEG_6052), four CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_1122, MSMEG_1123, MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6069), a methyltransferase (MSMEG_6055), and the set of genes encoding ARPs (MSMEG_6065-6068, MSMEG_6070). Some promoter-operators harbored more than one predicted motif (MSMEG_6047, MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6055), which suggests a complex regulation of these genes, as already described for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces coelicolor</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Cupriavidus metallidurans</span> (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Notably, <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> was also preceded by a putative Zur binding site. SmtB motif prediction by the MEME Suite based on the promoter sequences of the genes of the MSMEG SmtB regulon was not successful due to the low number of genes. Therefore, we used in our FIMO analysis the putative SmtB binding site of MTB, which was previously predicted from <i>in vitro</i> binding assays with <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter fragments (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). However, we were unable to confirm the presence of a SmtB binding site upstream of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> of MSMEG.</div>

<i>zitA</i> is regulated by SmtB.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">FIMO analysis of the MSMEG genome did not predict any conclusive SmtB binding sites, neither for <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> nor for any other SmtB-regulated gene, even though <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> transcription repression by SmtB has been previously proposed for MTB and MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). To dissect the relevance of SmtB in the regulation of genes in MSMEG, we analyzed MSMEG_0755, the <i>zitA</i> homologue of MSMEG, whose expression was strongly induced in the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> mutant and which shows significant homologies to other CDF transporters (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). Since MSMEG_0750 has also been proposed as a gene homologue of <i>zitA</i> (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>), we first analyzed expression of both genes upon zinc stress. We observed a concentration-dependent induction of MSMEG_0755 but not of MSMEG_0750 (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>), confirming the relevance of MSMEG_0755 in zinc homeostasis. In a next step, we fused the promoter of MSMEG_0755 (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>) to <i>lacZ</i> using the expression vector pJEM15 and analyzed promoter activity by a Î²-galactosidase assay in MSMEGwt and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> under standard conditions and upon zinc starvation (TPEN) or zinc excess (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>). These analyses revealed that promoter activity was significantly induced upon zinc stress in MSMEGwt and constantly high under all conditions in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). To analyze a direct involvement of SmtB in MSMEG_0755 regulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> was complemented with Flag-tagged SmtB, and DNA-protein complexes were precipitated after cross-linking with an antibody targeting the Flag tag or an isogenic IgG control antibody. DNA from ChIP was quantified by qRT-PCR with primers targeting the MSMEG_0755 promoter and additionally with primers targeting the promoter of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i>, which was included as a SmtB but zinc independently regulated gene, as well as intragenic control primers, located in MSMEG_0755 and in the <i>zur</i> gene. As shown in <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>, ChIP led to the significant enrichment of MSMEG_0755 promoter DNA but not, however, of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter or the intragenic controls when grown under standard conditions. This indicated that SmtB binds to the MSMEG_0755 promoter despite the absence of a SmtB binding motif similar to MTB but suggests the presence of a different SmtB binding site, which has to be identified in future experiments.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Regulation of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is dependent on both regulators.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Transcriptional analyses of the <i>smtB</i> and <i>zur</i> deletion mutants suggested that both SmtB and Zur regulate their own expression, since deletion of one regulator affected the expression of the other. This regulation was independent of zinc (<a href=""#tab1"">Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#tab2"">2</a>; <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a>). The data shown above, however, suggest that SmtB plays an inferior role in regulation, as no binding of SmtB to the promoter was visible under standard conditions (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>). These findings were in contrast to those in other mycobacteria, as <i>smtB</i> expression was zinc dependent in MAP and regulated by SmtB in MTB (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Therefore, we studied the relevance of Zur and SmtB on MSMEG <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> regulation in more detail. First, we analyzed promoter activity of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter after transformation of MSMEGwt, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> with pJEM15-<i>smtB1</i> (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). As shown in <a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>, promoter activity was significantly enhanced in all mutants compared to that in the wild type. Upon TPEN or ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, no change in promoter activity was observed in the wild type or in the double mutant. In contrast, in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, zinc depletion resulted in reduced promoter activity and zinc excess resulted in higher promoter activity. In MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, promoter activity was lower upon ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment and increased upon addition of TPEN. This indicated that in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, the remaining regulator, SmtB, binds to the promoter when zinc is absent, whereas in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, Zur binds to the promoter when zinc is present (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Remarkably, zinc-dependent regulation was detectable only in the absence of the other regulator.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Unlike with MTB, a Zur binding site but no comprehensive SmtB binding motif could be identified by FIMO analysis in the <i>smtB</i> promoter of MSMEG. Thus, we performed ChIP analyses to elucidate the zinc-dependent direct binding of both regulators to their respective promoters, using MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> expressing Flag-tagged SmtB and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> complemented with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Zur. As shown in <a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>, the amount of DNA of the <i>smtB</i> promoter was significantly enriched after Zur ChIP (anti-HA), whereas no enrichment was observed after SmtB ChIP (anti-Flag) and in the intragenic <i>zur</i> control (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>), demonstrating direct binding of Zur to the promoter region of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> under standard growth conditions. Exposure of the bacteria to changing zinc concentrations influenced promoter binding of the regulators. Zur binding was significantly reduced upon zinc starvation (TPEN) but increased upon addition of zinc, indicated by the depletion or enrichment of DNA of the <i>smtB-zur</i> promoter region, respectively (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). Enrichment of promoter DNA after SmtB ChIP was visible only when zinc was depleted by TPEN (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). These data clearly show that in MSMEG, Zur and SmtB replace each other to regulate their own expression in response to zinc availability (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Despite the importance of zinc in mycobacterial metabolism, only a few studies have been published on mycobacterial zinc homeostasis. The importance of zinc was deduced mostly from studies focusing on mycobacterial pathogens (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). All information concerning the transcriptional regulation of zinc homeostasis regulators SmtB and Zur has been obtained in MSMEG by heterologous expression of the MTB <i>smtB</i> and MSMEG <i>smtB</i> promoters (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our transcriptomic analyses of the MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as well as the transcriptomes of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> mutants revealed a complete and complex picture of zinc-dependent gene regulation in MSMEG. Most genes in MSMEG affected by zinc encoded already known or putative zinc transport systems, as well as chaperones and alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs). The known and common importer <i>znuABC</i> (MSMEG_6045-6047) was induced upon zinc starvation and Zur deletion in MSMEG. This finding was comparable to Zur-controlled, homologous <i>znuABC</i> in MTB (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>) and MAP transporter MAP3776-3774c (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Similar to other bacteria, MSMEG regulates expression of CobW-like proteins upon zinc starvation. Homologous genes in MAP and MTB have been shown to be regulated zinc dependently by Zur (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Cupriavidus metallidurans</span>, CobW proteins substitute for missing zinc importers (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). During zinc starvation, expression of genes <i>rpmB</i>, <i>rpmG</i>, <i>rpsN</i>, <i>rpsR</i>, and <i>rpmE2</i> encoding ARPs was highly induced and regulated by Zur. ARPs do not need zinc as a structural component and support MSMEG survival upon zinc limitation (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Higher expression of such genes under limiting zinc conditions has also been described for MTB, MAP, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces coelicolor,</span> and other bacteria (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Concerning zinc export in MSMEG, our results revealed that expression of the zinc exporter MSMEG ZitA, encoded by MSMEG_0755, was directly regulated by SmtB, which is in accordance with findings on MTB ZitA (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). Thus, MSMEG seems to possess zinc storage and transport mechanisms similar to those of pathogenic mycobacteria. However, in contrast to pathogenic mycobacteria, the MSMEG zinc regulon comprises additional putative zinc uptake systems, such as the predicted Zn uptake transporter encoded by MSMEG_6049-6051 or <i>mspD</i> (MSMEG_6057). The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium smegmatis</span> <span data-style=""underline"">p</span>orins (Msp) represent a group of four highly similar proteins (MspA to -D) specific for mycobacteria. MspA is involved in the uptake of glucose (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), phosphate (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>), amino acid (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>), and iron (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>), and MspC is involved in copper uptake and growth (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). MspD differs from the other Msps in 18 amino acids only, but no substrate specificity has been described so far. Our study indicates that MspD may play a role in zinc uptake and might presumably provide an additional rapid channel-based exchange system for nutrients. Remarkably, MSMEG_6049, which is part of the MSMEG_6049-6051 operon, showed no homology to genes of pathogenic mycobacteria but to MVAN_5323 of the nonpathogenic <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium vanbaalenii</span>. This gene is predicted to be part of a second Zur-regulated <i>znuABC</i> transporter. Due to the observed high expression in MSMEG treated with TPEN and in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, the transporter operon MSMEG_6049-6051 might, therefore, encode an additional zinc importer in MSMEG. With regard to mycobacterial phylogeny, the absence of these transport systems in pathogenic mycobacteria suggests a better zinc availability in the host. In the concept of phylogenetic adaptation of pathogens to their host, this might have led to the loss of additional uptake systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our analyses unraveled the transcriptional regulation of the MSMEG <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon. The results indicate that in MSMEG, as with zinc import, regulation of zinc homeostasis also seems to be more complex than in pathogenic mycobacteria. SmtB and Zur are both sensitive measures of zinc concentration in other bacteria (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). Expression of the operon is autoregulated by SmtB in MTB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) and/or is zinc dependent, as shown for MAP (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Here, we found that in MSMEGwt, expression of <i>smtB</i> and <i>zur</i> was unaffected when zinc was either absent or in excess (<a href=""#tab1"">Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#tab2"">2</a>; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a> in the supplemental material). This finding is in accordance with that in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. coelicolor,</span> in which the amount of Zur protein under high or low zinc conditions remained constant (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Strikingly, the apparently constitutive expression of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> in MSMEG was maintained by SmtB and Zur, depending on the availability of zinc. We found that both regulators affect the expression of their operon. Our promoter studies with the regulator deletion mutants revealed that both SmtB and Zur are needed for full regulatory control of their operon promoter. Furthermore, we showed that the regulation of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is hierarchic. Zur seems to dominate the control and represses expression of the operon when zinc is freely available for the bacterium (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>). We further show antagonistic binding of one regulator to the operator in the absence of the other (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a> and <a href=""#fig5"">D</a>). Hence, even in the case of imbalances in zinc homeostasis, expression of the operon is never uncontrolled. The importance of controlled <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is also indicated by our zone of inhibition (ZoI) assays (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig. 2D</a> to <a href=""#fig2"">F</a>). They show that differential gene expression in MSMEG lacking Zur or SmtB results in reduced zinc tolerance, which is not observable when both regulators are absent in the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant. Thus, the regulons of Zur and SmtB are necessary for maintaining MSMEG zinc homeostasis. If uncontrolled, differential gene expression alone cannot cope with zinc imbalances, which is illustrated by the reduced zinc tolerance of the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant when exposed to high zinc concentrations in the ZoI assays. However, the quality of zinc imbalances in the MSMEG single mutants needs to be clarified in future experiments. The antagonistic influence of Zur and SmtB on <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression has not yet been reported for other bacteria. On first glance, such an autoregulation seems to be peculiar. However, a closer look reveals that it is necessary for a sensitive control of zinc homeostasis. In the case of sole regulation by Zur, the operon would be derepressed upon zinc limitation. This might lead to excessive synthesis of apo-Zur and may delay or impair the shutdown of zinc importers when zinc is sufficiently available. Moreover, additional SmtB produced simultaneously would impair its own deactivation and block zinc export to avoid zinc excess. On the other hand, sole regulation by SmtB would allow operon expression exclusively when MSMEG encounters an excess of zinc, or it would depend on the half-life of SmtB, since SmtB binds to the DNA in its apo form (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">6A</a>). This mechanism might be likely in organisms with stable zinc homeostasis. However, due to limited apo-Zur production, this mechanism would be disadvantageous for controlling zinc import after starvation. Therefore, the better capability to react quickly to changing zinc concentrations might also explain why Zur is the dominating regulator in this complex regulatory mechanism. The dominance of Zur also makes sense, as the environmental bioavailability of zinc is presumably low. Accordingly, in liquid culture, growth of MSMEG was hampered only in the absence of <i>zur</i> (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>), which might be explained by an uncontrolled zinc influx due to the lack of counterregulation. This, however, needs to be proven by additional studies in the future.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In pathogenic MTB, <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> regulation seems to be solely affected by SmtB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). This suggests that mycobacteria in the host are exposed to more constant or higher zinc concentrations than they are in the environment, which would make regulation by SmtB more plausible and might reflect another example of mycobacterial adaptation to the host.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overall, in the present study, we provide novel insights into the response of MSMEG to changing zinc concentrations. We show that MSMEG is well adapted to environmental changes in zinc availability. This is achieved by a sensitive regulation of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon by both Zur and SmtB, allowing a balanced expression of the two regulators even under changing zinc concentrations and by the presence of additional putative zinc transporters in the genome. These mechanisms enable MSMEG to maintain reactivity and to constantly control intracellular zinc homeostasis.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

Fragments were cloned into pJET1.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced. Plasmids containing the correct sequence were restriction digested with either HindIII/BsmBI (A) or BsmBI/KpnI (B) in the case of Î<i>smtB</i> and with HindIII/BbsI (A) or BbsI/KpnI (B) in the case of Î<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i>. The fragments were subsequently ligated to HindIII/KpnI-digested p2NIL, resulting in deletion plasmids p2NIL-MSMEG4486AB and p2NIL-MSMEG4486-87AB. A marker gene cassette from pGOAL19, digested with PacI, was then ligated into the deletion plasmids, designated p2NIL-MSMEG4486-Del and p2NIL-MSMEG4486-87-Del. MSMEGwt competent cells were electroporated with 1 to 5âÎ¼g of plasmid DNA which had been pretreated with 100 mJ UV light cm<sup>â2</sup>. Selection of mutants was performed as described by Parish and Stoker (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>) with minor modifications as described earlier (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Mutants were screened by PCR using primers 7 to 12.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Homologous complementation of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> was achieved by reintroducing <i>smtB</i> (MSMEG_4486) and <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4486-87), respectively, both under the control of their own promoter, by PCR cloning from genomic DNA of MSMEGwt using primers 13/14 and 13/15, respectively. MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> was complemented with <i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4487) under the control of the <i>smtB</i> promoter. For this, genomic DNA of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> was used as the template for PCR with primers 13/14. The PCR fragments were digested with HindIII/XbaI and ligated to HindIII/XbaI-digested pMV306hyg. The resulting plasmids were designated pMV-MS<i>smtB</i>, pMV-MS<i>smtBzur</i> and pMV-MS<i>zur</i>, sequenced, and subsequently transformed into the corresponding mutant. Complemented strains were designated MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>Î<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>. In addition, for the ChIP assay, MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> were complemented with a plasmid harboring a Flag-tagged <i>smtB</i> gene (pMV-MS<i>smtB</i><sup>Flag</sup>) and an HA-tagged <i>zur</i> gene, respectively (pMV-MS<i>zur</i><sup>HA</sup>). pMV-MS<i>smtB</i><sup>Flag</sup> was obtained by inverse PCR of pMV-MS<i>smtB</i> with primers 16/17 using Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), pMV-MS<i>zur</i><sup>HA</sup> was constructed by ligation of AgeI/HindIII-digested pMV-MS<i>zur</i> and AgeI/HindIII-digested PCR product, which was generated with primers 18/19. After sequencing of the plasmid, successful Flag tag expression was confirmed via Western blot analysis (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1A</a> and <a href=""#figS1"">C</a>) and functional complementation by qRT-PCR using primers 9 to 12 and 20 to 23, targeting <i>smtB</i>, <i>zur</i>, <i>zitA</i>, and MSMEG_6069 (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a> and <a href=""#figS1"">D</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Total RNA for transcriptome analysis was prepared from cultures in MB. MSMEG strains were grown in MB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 2.0. MSMEGwt cultures for zinc starvation or excess were divided in two and subsequently treated with 10âÎ¼M TPEN or 100, 500, and 1,000âÎ¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> or were left untreated (control) for 2 h. RNA deep sequencing of MSMEGwt treated with TPEN or zinc and MSMEG mutants was performed as described before (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). The quality and integrity value RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt;8 of total RNA was controlled on an Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer or checked by a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The RNA sequencing libraries were generated from 250âng total RNA using a Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (bacteria) (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for rRNA depletion, followed by a ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicentre, WI, USA) according to the manufacturersâ protocols. Briefly, 50-bp single-end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 or a NovaSeq 6000 PE50 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a mean output of 15âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> reads per sample. BWA v. 0.7.5 was applied for the alignment of sequences against the reference strain MSMEG mc<sup>2</sup> 155 (NCBI accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_008596"">NC_008596</a>) with an average mapping rate of 90% and a share of rRNAs around 6%.

<div role=""paragraph"">Strains MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>CFlag</sup> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>CHA</sup> were grown in MB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 2.0 as described before and treated with 10âÎ¼M TPEN or 100âÎ¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> for 2 h or left untreated (control). Cultures were then cross-linked with 1% methanol-free formaldehyde for 20âmin at room temperature on a rolling incubator. The reaction was quenched with 0.125 M glycine, cells were harvested and washed twice with 50âmM Tris-HClâplusâ10âmM EDTA (pH 7.5), and lysates were prepared as described by Eckelt et al. (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) with minor modifications. Cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl plus EDTA (pH 7.5) buffer and lysed in a ribolyzer, and DNA was sheared by sonification (ultrasonic intensity duty cycle constant) for 20âmin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (11,000âÃâ<i>g</i>, 30âmin, 4Â°C). Protein concentration was determined by MicroBCA as described previously (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as follows: 250âÎ¼g protein from lysates was mixed with 30âÎ¼l salmon sperm DNAâprotein A/G agarose matrix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA) and 2âÎ¼g anti-DYKDDDK (Flag) antibody or IgG2a rat antibody (unspecific binding control) for SmtB-Flag ChIP and 2âÎ¼g anti-HA antibody or IgG1Îº mouse antibody for Zur-HA ChIP (all antibodies from BioLegend, CA, USA), and samples were adjusted with ChIP DLP buffer {16.7âmM Tris-HCl, 1.2âmM, 167âmM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1âmM AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride], pH 8.0} to a final total volume of 800âÎ¼l and incubated overnight at 4Â°C (rotating incubator). Protein A/G-antibody-DNA complexes were pelleted, and 100âÎ¼l of the supernatant from each sample was retained as input control. Beads were washed as described by Braunstein et al. (<a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>) and finally resuspended in 55âÎ¼l 10âmM Tris-HClâ1âmM EDTAâ1% SDS buffer (pH 8.0). DNA-protein complexes were eluted from agarose beads by heating (1,200ârpm, 30âmin, 70Â°C) and centrifugation (11,000âÃâ<i>g</i>, 30âs, 4Â°C). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted with 150âÎ¼l TE buffer (10âmM Tris-HCl, 1âmM EDTA, pH 8.0). DNA from ChIP and input samples was isolated upon treatment with RNase (250âÎ¼g/ml) for 30âmin at 37Â°C, proteinase K (1âÎ¼g/ml) for 2 h at 37Â°C, and 160âmM NaCl at 65Â°C overnight, followed by standard phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and precipitation in the presence of 40âÎ¼g glycogen with 140âmM LiCl and ethanol 99.8% for 30âmin at room temperature. DNA was pelleted, washed with 80% ethanol, and dissolved in distilled water. DNA from ChIP was analyzed by qRT-PCR in a total volume of 20âÎ¼l containing 2âÎ¼l of ChIP-DNA, 10âÎ¼l SYBR green mix (Qiagen), and 200 nM specific primers by using a Stratagene MX3005P cycler. Primer pairs were selected for either the <i>smtB</i> and <i>zitA</i> promoter (primers 30 to 33) or intragenic controls (primers 34 to 37). For primer efficacy, 1 Î¼g of each input DNA was pooled, serially diluted, and used for every single primer pair (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The PCR conditions were 95Â°C for 20âmin, 95Â°C for 45âs, 58Â°C for 1âmin, and 72Â°C for 1âmin, followed by a melting curve of the product as the control. Data were analyzed as follows: in a first step, threshold cycle (<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) values of the input were subtracted from <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of antibody-treated samples (Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>). Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of isotype controls (IgG2a, IgG1Îº) were then subtracted from Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of anti-Flag- or anti-HA-precipitated samples (ÎÎ<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) and calculated as log<sub>2</sub> to determine the relative fold change.

<div role=""paragraph"">Differentially expressed genes obtained by Rockhopper analysis were further analyzed with NCBI blastx and the TB database (<a href=""http://genome.tbdb.org"">http://genome.tbdb.org</a>) to identify putative protein functions. Putative Zur binding sites in MSMEG (accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_008596"">NC_008596</a>) were identified by FIMO analysis.

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Zinc is crucial for many biological processes, as it is an essential cofactor of enzymes and a structural component of regulatory and DNA binding proteins. Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export. Here, we analyzed the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium smegmatis</span>. Our results revealed novel insights into the transcriptional processes of zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria and their regulation.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">In living eukaryotic and bacterial cells, zinc plays an essential role in numerous cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, DNA binding, and many enzymatic reactions (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Thus, it is essential for the survival of eukaryotes and bacteria. However, as with iron and copper, the bioavailability of zinc is very low (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Hence, depending on their environmental niches, bacteria are exposed to various zinc concentrations (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>). Zinc (and other trace metals) also play a role in innate immunity. For example, macrophages can actively fend off bacterial infection by increasing or depleting zinc, thereby causing either intoxication or starvation of the bacteria (nutritional immunity) (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Therefore, in the environment as well as in the host, bacteria need mechanisms to efficiently regulate zinc homeostasis. Zinc homeostasis is achieved by the expression of regulated or nonregulated, specific or nonspecific, energy-dependent or -independent systems. Cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs), such as CzcD of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</span> (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) and ZitB of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</span> (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), allow regulated, specific, ATP-independent uptake or efflux (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), whereas the activity of specific low-affinity zinc importers of the ZIP family, e.g., ZupT of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), or high-affinity transporters such as P<sub>1</sub>-type ATPases, e.g., ZntA of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span> (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>) and CtpC of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (MTB) (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>), is mostly ATP dependent (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>, <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). The most prominent family of inducible high-affinity bacterial zinc transporters is the common ATP binding cassette (ABC) importer ZnuABC, which is an important virulence factor in many bacteria, e.g., <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Salmonella enterica</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Campylobacter jejuni</span>, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Yersinia pestis</span> (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a><a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15 B16 B17 B18"">â</a><a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bacteria are able to sense alterations of intracellular zinc concentration in the femtomolar range by zinc-responsive regulators (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). They regulate the expression of zinc uptake, export, or storage systems. Examples include DtxR (<span data-style=""underline"">d</span>iphtheria <span data-style=""underline"">t</span>o<span data-style=""underline"">x</span>in <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like regulators such as TroR of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Treponema pallidum</span>, MerR (<span data-style=""underline"">me</span>tal-<span data-style=""underline"">r</span>esponsive <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like regulators such as ZntR of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">E. coli</span>, and ArsR (<span data-style=""underline"">ar</span>senite-<span data-style=""underline"">s</span>ensitive <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator)-like repressors such as SmtB of <i>Synechococcus</i> species and CzrA of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, and Zur (<span data-style=""underline"">z</span>inc <span data-style=""underline"">u</span>ptake <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator, also known as FurB) of MTB, a member of the Fur (<span data-style=""underline"">f</span>erric <span data-style=""underline"">u</span>ptake <span data-style=""underline"">r</span>egulator) family (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22 B23 B24 B25"">â</a><a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Knowledge of zinc homeostasis and its regulation in mycobacteria is very limited. Most information concerning pathogenic species is based on heterologous studies in the nonpathogenic <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium smegmatis</span> (MSMEG). These studies indicate that the antagonistically acting repressors SmtB and Zur regulate zinc homeostasis by using zinc as a cofactor (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). Thereby they regulate bacterial responses to changing intracellular zinc availability by activating or repressing the expression of importer or exporter genes. During starvation, apo-Zur is released from the DNA, allowing zinc import by derepression of zinc importer genes such as MTB <i>znuABC</i> and <i>yciC</i> (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Similar activity of Zur was observed in the ruminant pathogen <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium avium</span> subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i> (MAP) (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Holo-SmtB detaches from the DNA when zinc is in excess, thereby allowing gene transcription of zinc exporters such as ZitA of MTB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). Zinc-dependent regulation of <i>smtB</i> expression has been demonstrated for MTB and MAP (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). In these species, SmtB has been shown to be cotranscribed with Zur from an operon (here referred to as <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i>) which seems to be autoregulated by SmtB (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). Cotranscription and autoregulation has also been proposed for MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>), suggesting a general regulation concept of the operon in mycobacteria.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Little is known about the influence of zinc on gene expression in mycobacteria. The regulons of MTB Zur and the zinc starvation regulon of MAP have been identified (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). These studies revealed a Zur-dependent and zinc starvation-dependent induction of a set of genes, which encode alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs). ARPs, in contrast to their zinc-containing paralogues, do not use zinc as a structural component. In addition, the virulence-associated mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX-3, the zinc importer <i>znuABC</i>, and CobW-like chaperones were all induced upon Zur deletion or zinc starvation (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>, <a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). However, direct involvement of Zur in regulation was based on binding site predictions only and was not experimentally confirmed (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Knowledge of the role of SmtB in zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria is limited to prediction of its binding site in MTB and studies of its promoter in MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In nonpathogenic mycobacteria, e.g., MSMEG, very few studies have been published on zinc homeostasis. These include the presence of a <i>zitA</i> homologue (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), the zinc-dependent DNA repair protein KU, which is important for zinc resistance (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>), and the involvement of mycobacterial protein Y (MPY) in the hibernation of alternative ribosomes (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the present study, we applied a comprehensive transcriptional approach to investigate the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon of mycobacteria in the context of MSMEG responses to zinc starvation and excess as well as the regulons of SmtB and Zur. Our results provide novel insights into zinc-dependent gene regulation in MSMEG and reveal additional putative zinc transport systems. Moreover, we demonstrated the relevance of SmtB and Zur during zinc stress and starvation and characterized details of their own regulation. The results indicate that the regulation of zinc homeostasis in MSMEG is more complex than that in pathogenic mycobacteria. Overall, we provide novel findings which contribute to our understanding of mycobacterial responses to changing zinc concentrations.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>The <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon structure is conserved in mycobacteria.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Regulation of zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria is achieved by the antagonistic activity of the regulators SmtB and Zur (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). These regulators are also present in other bacterial genera, but, in contrast to mycobacteria, they are encoded on separate genes which are not organized in an operon. Hence, we were interested in whether this organization is specific for mycobacteria. We performed phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> of MSMEG in NCBI BLASTN and subsequent neighborhood joining analysis. Of the 42 strains harboring the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon, 39 were mycobacterial strains. They could be grouped into mainly environmental/nonpathogenic and mainly pathogenic species. The remaining three strains were genera of the phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, e.g., <i>Nocardia</i> species and <i>Saccharothrix</i> species (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). Furthermore, an operon was also found in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</span> but with significantly lower sequence homology (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). Thus, the arrangement of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> on an operon as present in mycobacteria is otherwise observed only in a very small group of actinobacteria. Operon structure was confirmed in selected species by extracting the genome regions homologous to MSMEG <i>zur</i> and <i>smtB</i> and by performing multiple sequence alignments. The coding sequences homologous to <i>zur</i> and <i>smtB</i> are overlapping in MSMEG, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium thermoresistibile</span>, MTB, and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Saccharothrix espanaensis</span>. In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Nocardia asteroides</span>, the two coding sequences are separated by 4 bp (see <a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2</a> in the supplemental material).</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Zur and SmtB contribute to zinc resistance in MSMEG.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To get more insight into the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis of MSMEG, we determined their regulons. For this, we used the previously published regulator mutant MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) and generated the deletion mutants MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎs<i>mtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> as well as the complemented strains MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>Î<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Mutation, complementation, and polar effects on the adjacent gene MSMEG_4488 were controlled by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>). As expected, <i>smtB</i> expression was abolished in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> but still present in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>. Vice versa, expression of <i>zur</i> was observed in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> but was not detectable in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> or MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i>. Interestingly, expression of <i>smtB</i> was higher in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> and expression of <i>zur</i> was higher in MSMEGÎs<i>mtB</i> than in the wild type, suggesting that both regulators contribute to their own expression. Complementation restored the wild-type phenotype; mRNA expression of the respective genes on the integrated complementation vector was higher in the complemented strains than in the wild type. The adjacent gene, MSMEG_4488, was expressed in all mutated strains (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Growth kinetics of all strains were monitored in standard MB (see Materials and Methods). Growth of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and the double mutant MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> was comparable to that of the wild type (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">C</a>). Only MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> showed a significantly reduced growth and had entered the stationary phase already after 27 h. Complementation restored the wild-type phenotype (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>). To analyze differences in zinc tolerance of the different mutants, we used a plating assay with increasing zinc concentrations. Briefly, strains were spread on agar and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was applied to filter discs in increasing concentrations. No growth inhibition was visible with water control. At low ZnSO<sub>4</sub> concentrations (25âmM), growth of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> was significantly impaired, as indicated by a larger zone of growth inhibition (ZoI), which was not observed for wild-type MSMEG (MSMEGwt) and the complemented strains (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2D</a> and <a href=""#fig2"">E</a>). The double mutant showed significantly reduced growth at higher concentrations (50 or 100âmM) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2F</a>). Hence, all mutants were affected in growth, most likely by impaired abilities to maintain zinc homeostasis.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Responses of MSMEG to changes in zinc homeostasis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The above-described data suggest an involvement of SmtB and Zur in control of zinc homeostasis. To further dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed the transcriptional response of MSMEGwt cultures treated with the zinc chelator TPEN [<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>Nâ²</i>,<i>Nâ²</i>-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine] (10âÎ¼M) or exposed to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (500âÎ¼M). Gene expression was determined by RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the transcriptome of MSMEG treated with TPEN or exposed to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was compared to that of the untreated control.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Zinc starvation upon TPEN treatment resulted in the differential expression of 58 genes (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; <a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>), which are organized in 10 operons (as predicted by Rockhopper analysis). Higher expression was observed for 26 genes and lower expression for 32 genes. More than 60% of the differentially expressed genes exhibited 4- to 7-fold changes. These genes encode proteins involved in energy conversion (MSMEG_1768, MSMEG_3541), transport (MSMEG_2925), gene regulation (MSMEG_1769), and stress and immune responses (MSMEG_3945, MSMEG_5617). Others are involved in metabolic and enzymatic processes (MSMEG_0115, MSMEG_0117, MSMEG_0266, MSMEG_0280, MSMEG_0684, MSMEG_1097, MSMEG_1155, MSMEG_1156, MSMEG_2343, MSMEG_2913, MSMEG_3304, MSMEG_3785, MSMEG_3929, MSMEG_5616, MSMEG_6071, MSMEG_6664) or are of unknown function (MSMEG_0669, MSMEG_0672, MSMEG_1767, MSMEG_1774, MSMEG_1781, MSMEG_1802, MSMEG_1951, MSMEG_2958, MSMEG_5154, MSMEG_6211, MSMEG_6610, MSMEG_6615, MSMEG_6728).</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Differentially expressed genes with a fold change of â¥7 comprised the genes MSMEG_5406 and MSMEG_6237 (encoding hypothetical proteins) and a special cluster of genes, MSMEG_6045-6071, which was more highly expressed after zinc starvation (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3C</a>). This cluster comprised genes encoding four putative transporters (MSMEG_6049-6051, MSMEG_6052, MSMEG_6058-6059), including the common ZnuABC transporter (MSMEG_6045-6047), two CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_6048 and MSMEG_6069), the latter representing the recently described mycobacterium-specific protein Y (MPY) recruitment factor (MRF) (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>), a set of genes encoding zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs) RpsR, RpsN, RpmG, RpmB, and RpmE2 (MSMEG_6065, MSMEG_6066, MSMEG_6067, MSMEG_6068, MSMEG_6070), a gene encoding the porin MspD (MSMEG_6057), and two genes of unknown function (MSMEG_6055, MSMEG_6064). In addition, â¥7-fold-lower expression upon TPEN treatment was observed for the cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance gene MSMEG_0755. The encoded protein belongs to the group of CDF transporters, is closely related to the P<sub>1B</sub>-type ATPase CzcD (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>), and is a putative homologue of the zinc exporter ZitA (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">MSMEG responded to zinc excess by differential expression of only 20 genes, i.e., 13 with higher expression and 7 with lower expression, compared to the untreated control (<a href=""#tab2"">TableÂ 2</a>). They are predicted to be involved in transcription/regulation (MSMEG_6292, MSMEG_6764, MSMEG_6903), metabolic or enzymatic processes (MSMEG_6664, MSMEG_6904), stress response (MSMEG_1392, MSMEG_5117, MSMEG_6242), and (metal) transport (MSMEG_0755, MSMEG_1530, MSMEG_5014, MSMEG_5418) or are of unknown function (MSMEG_0230, MSMEG_0689, MSMEG_3323, MSMEG_3325, MSMEG_5015, MSMEG_5016, MSMEG_5549, MSMEG_6237). Moreover, the expression of MSMEG_6903 and MSMEG_6904 was reduced upon zinc addition. These genes encode a PadR family transcription regulator and a synthase involved in myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) generation, respectively. The MIP protein has been shown to form a complex with zinc (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). Within the group of genes with higher expression, we found a gene cluster putatively involved in zinc transport (MSMEG_5014-5016) and a proline dehydrogenase (MSMEG_5117). However, the most prominently affected gene of the zinc stress transcriptome was MSMEG_0755, which was strongly induced upon zinc excess and, as shown above, had lower expression upon zinc starvation (<a href=""#tab1"">TableÂ 1</a>). This supports the hypothesis that MSMEG_0755 is involved in zinc export.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab2"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overall, the MSMEG response to zinc limitation involved a large number of genes associated with zinc homeostasis. The response to zinc excess, however, was less pronounced, as it caused only moderate changes in gene expression, and most of these genes could not be assigned to zinc homeostasis.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>SmtB and Zur control zinc homeostasis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To dissect the relevance of MSMEG SmtB and Zur for zinc homeostasis, we determined the regulons of both regulators by RNA sequencing of the respective mutants and the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant. Differentially expressed genes were compared with those of zinc starvation and stress regulons to determine the zinc dependency of SmtB/Zur-regulated genes.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Transcriptome analysis of the MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> mutant revealed 46 differentially expressed genes compared to MSMEGwt. Differential expression of 25 of these genes was congruent with the TPEN or zinc stress transcriptome (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a> and <a href=""#fig3"">C</a>). They were classified as Zur and zinc dependently regulated genes (<a href=""#tab3"">TableÂ 3</a>). The remaining 21 genes were considered Zur dependent but zinc independently regulated (<a href=""#tab4"">TableÂ 4</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab4"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In the group of zinc-dependent genes, which were all but four more highly expressed in the mutant than in the wild type, we found several extremely highly induced genes (&gt;100- to 5,000-fold change). These included genes encoding ARPs (MSMEG_6065-6068 and MSMEG_6070), as well as two genes coding for CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6069) and a putative ABC transporter (MSMEG_6049-6051). In addition, a number of genes encoding other predicted cation transporters (MSMEG_6052, MSMEG_6058-6059), the predicted ZnuABC importer (MSMEG_6045-6047), the porin MspD (MSMEG_6057) as well as three genes of unknown function (MSMEG_6064, MSMEG_6071, MSMEG_6237) and one coding for a methyltransferase (MSMEG_6055) were classified as Zur and zinc dependent.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The majority of zinc-independent genes differentially expressed in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> showed only weak differences in expression compared to the wild type. However, we found some interesting clusters, e.g., one encoding a group of chaperones (MSMEG_0880, MSMEG_1582, MSMEG_1583) and one an iron uptake system (MSMEG_6062-6063), which were more highly expressed in the mutant, whereas gene clusters involved in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (MSMEG_3787-3789), ectoine synthesis (expressed at higher salt concentrations) (MSMEG_3898-3901), and other metabolic pathways (MSMEG_0584, MSMEG_5021, MSMEG_5022, MSMEG_6239-6242) showed reduced expression compared to the wild type.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Two genes were highly affected by <i>zur</i> deletion but were zinc independent: expression of MSMEG_4486 (<i>smtB</i>) was â¼95-fold increased and transcription of MSMEG_4596, coding for a putative LppH protein, was strongly repressed (â¼116-fold). The function of the latter gene is unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The SmtB regulon was relatively small. Overall, only 12 genes were differentially expressed. Of these, only five belonged exclusively to the SmtB regulon (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; <a href=""#tab5"">TableÂ 5</a>). Five genes were also present in the Zur regulon. Two genes were SmtB and zinc dependent (MSMEG_5117, MSMEG_0755). Only the expression of the cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance gene MSMEG_0755 was affected by <i>smtB</i> deletion and TPEN and zinc treatment. While its expression was decreased (â¼34-fold) upon zinc starvation and induced (â¼14-fold) upon zinc excess, <i>smtB</i> deletion resulted in an â¼80-fold increase of expression. In the group of zinc-independent genes, we found two poorly characterized transcriptional regulator genes (MSMEG_3959, MSMEG_3960), <i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4487), one gene involved in metabolism (MSMEG_2659), and a gene encoding a protein of the ferritin family (MSMEG_6422). All these genes were more highly expressed in the mutant.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""tab5"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We then compared the Zur and SmtB regulons with the transcriptome of the MSMEG<i>ÎsmtBÎzur</i> double mutant. Among 81 differentially expressed genes in MSMEG<i>ÎsmtBÎzur</i> (see <a href=""#tabS3"">TableÂ S3</a> in the supplemental material) with a &gt;4-fold change, expression of 42 genes was congruent with genes of the single mutant regulons (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). Hence, expression of 79% of the genes regulated by Zur and SmtB (42 of 53 differentially expressed genes in total) was also affected in the double mutant. The 39 remaining genes could be assigned mostly to metabolism and stress response, possibly due to the metal imbalance, and are regulated by other regulators.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Prediction and distribution of Zur and SmtB binding motifs in MSMEG.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To emphasize the direct involvement of SmtB and Zur in regulation, we were next interested in identification of putative binding motifs in the regulatory elements of regulated genes. We screened the MSMEG genome for putative SmtB and Zur binding sites by use of the MEME Suite and subsequent FIMO analysis. Due to the complex architecture of mycobacterial promoters, which can extend up to 2âkb (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a>), and the possible presence of more than one functional Zur box upstream of genes (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>), we considered motifs which were found in the 5â² untranslated region (UTR) up to â350âbp upstream of predicted open reading frames (ORFs) as putative binding sites. Of 46 motifs for Zur, 23 were found in the chosen 5â² UTR of ORFs (<a href=""#tab6"">TableÂ 6</a>). Among those, we found 12 motifs located in the promoter-operator region of Zur-regulated genes (<a href=""#tab6"">TableÂ 6</a>, indicated by boldface, and <a href=""#tab3"">TablesÂ 3</a> and <a href=""#tab4"">4</a>, indicated by asterisks), i.e., the predicted ZnuABC transporter (MSMEG_6045-6047) and a second ABC transporter (MSMEG_6052), four CobW-like proteins (MSMEG_1122, MSMEG_1123, MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6069), a methyltransferase (MSMEG_6055), and the set of genes encoding ARPs (MSMEG_6065-6068, MSMEG_6070). Some promoter-operators harbored more than one predicted motif (MSMEG_6047, MSMEG_6048, MSMEG_6055), which suggests a complex regulation of these genes, as already described for <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces coelicolor</span> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Cupriavidus metallidurans</span> (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>, <a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Notably, <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> was also preceded by a putative Zur binding site. SmtB motif prediction by the MEME Suite based on the promoter sequences of the genes of the MSMEG SmtB regulon was not successful due to the low number of genes. Therefore, we used in our FIMO analysis the putative SmtB binding site of MTB, which was previously predicted from <i>in vitro</i> binding assays with <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter fragments (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). However, we were unable to confirm the presence of a SmtB binding site upstream of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> of MSMEG.</div>

<i>zitA</i> is regulated by SmtB.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">FIMO analysis of the MSMEG genome did not predict any conclusive SmtB binding sites, neither for <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> nor for any other SmtB-regulated gene, even though <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> transcription repression by SmtB has been previously proposed for MTB and MSMEG (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). To dissect the relevance of SmtB in the regulation of genes in MSMEG, we analyzed MSMEG_0755, the <i>zitA</i> homologue of MSMEG, whose expression was strongly induced in the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> mutant and which shows significant homologies to other CDF transporters (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>). Since MSMEG_0750 has also been proposed as a gene homologue of <i>zitA</i> (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>, <a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>), we first analyzed expression of both genes upon zinc stress. We observed a concentration-dependent induction of MSMEG_0755 but not of MSMEG_0750 (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a>), confirming the relevance of MSMEG_0755 in zinc homeostasis. In a next step, we fused the promoter of MSMEG_0755 (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4B</a>) to <i>lacZ</i> using the expression vector pJEM15 and analyzed promoter activity by a Î²-galactosidase assay in MSMEGwt and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> under standard conditions and upon zinc starvation (TPEN) or zinc excess (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>). These analyses revealed that promoter activity was significantly induced upon zinc stress in MSMEGwt and constantly high under all conditions in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). To analyze a direct involvement of SmtB in MSMEG_0755 regulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> was complemented with Flag-tagged SmtB, and DNA-protein complexes were precipitated after cross-linking with an antibody targeting the Flag tag or an isogenic IgG control antibody. DNA from ChIP was quantified by qRT-PCR with primers targeting the MSMEG_0755 promoter and additionally with primers targeting the promoter of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i>, which was included as a SmtB but zinc independently regulated gene, as well as intragenic control primers, located in MSMEG_0755 and in the <i>zur</i> gene. As shown in <a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>, ChIP led to the significant enrichment of MSMEG_0755 promoter DNA but not, however, of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter or the intragenic controls when grown under standard conditions. This indicated that SmtB binds to the MSMEG_0755 promoter despite the absence of a SmtB binding motif similar to MTB but suggests the presence of a different SmtB binding site, which has to be identified in future experiments.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Regulation of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is dependent on both regulators.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Transcriptional analyses of the <i>smtB</i> and <i>zur</i> deletion mutants suggested that both SmtB and Zur regulate their own expression, since deletion of one regulator affected the expression of the other. This regulation was independent of zinc (<a href=""#tab1"">Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#tab2"">2</a>; <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a>). The data shown above, however, suggest that SmtB plays an inferior role in regulation, as no binding of SmtB to the promoter was visible under standard conditions (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>). These findings were in contrast to those in other mycobacteria, as <i>smtB</i> expression was zinc dependent in MAP and regulated by SmtB in MTB (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Therefore, we studied the relevance of Zur and SmtB on MSMEG <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> regulation in more detail. First, we analyzed promoter activity of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> promoter after transformation of MSMEGwt, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> with pJEM15-<i>smtB1</i> (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). As shown in <a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>, promoter activity was significantly enhanced in all mutants compared to that in the wild type. Upon TPEN or ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, no change in promoter activity was observed in the wild type or in the double mutant. In contrast, in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, zinc depletion resulted in reduced promoter activity and zinc excess resulted in higher promoter activity. In MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, promoter activity was lower upon ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment and increased upon addition of TPEN. This indicated that in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, the remaining regulator, SmtB, binds to the promoter when zinc is absent, whereas in MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>, Zur binds to the promoter when zinc is present (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>). Remarkably, zinc-dependent regulation was detectable only in the absence of the other regulator.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Unlike with MTB, a Zur binding site but no comprehensive SmtB binding motif could be identified by FIMO analysis in the <i>smtB</i> promoter of MSMEG. Thus, we performed ChIP analyses to elucidate the zinc-dependent direct binding of both regulators to their respective promoters, using MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> expressing Flag-tagged SmtB and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> complemented with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Zur. As shown in <a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>, the amount of DNA of the <i>smtB</i> promoter was significantly enriched after Zur ChIP (anti-HA), whereas no enrichment was observed after SmtB ChIP (anti-Flag) and in the intragenic <i>zur</i> control (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>), demonstrating direct binding of Zur to the promoter region of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> under standard growth conditions. Exposure of the bacteria to changing zinc concentrations influenced promoter binding of the regulators. Zur binding was significantly reduced upon zinc starvation (TPEN) but increased upon addition of zinc, indicated by the depletion or enrichment of DNA of the <i>smtB-zur</i> promoter region, respectively (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). Enrichment of promoter DNA after SmtB ChIP was visible only when zinc was depleted by TPEN (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>). These data clearly show that in MSMEG, Zur and SmtB replace each other to regulate their own expression in response to zinc availability (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6</a>).</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Despite the importance of zinc in mycobacterial metabolism, only a few studies have been published on mycobacterial zinc homeostasis. The importance of zinc was deduced mostly from studies focusing on mycobacterial pathogens (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). All information concerning the transcriptional regulation of zinc homeostasis regulators SmtB and Zur has been obtained in MSMEG by heterologous expression of the MTB <i>smtB</i> and MSMEG <i>smtB</i> promoters (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our transcriptomic analyses of the MSMEG response to zinc starvation and excess as well as the transcriptomes of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> mutants revealed a complete and complex picture of zinc-dependent gene regulation in MSMEG. Most genes in MSMEG affected by zinc encoded already known or putative zinc transport systems, as well as chaperones and alternative ribosomal proteins (ARPs). The known and common importer <i>znuABC</i> (MSMEG_6045-6047) was induced upon zinc starvation and Zur deletion in MSMEG. This finding was comparable to Zur-controlled, homologous <i>znuABC</i> in MTB (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>) and MAP transporter MAP3776-3774c (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Similar to other bacteria, MSMEG regulates expression of CobW-like proteins upon zinc starvation. Homologous genes in MAP and MTB have been shown to be regulated zinc dependently by Zur (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). In <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Cupriavidus metallidurans</span>, CobW proteins substitute for missing zinc importers (<a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>). During zinc starvation, expression of genes <i>rpmB</i>, <i>rpmG</i>, <i>rpsN</i>, <i>rpsR</i>, and <i>rpmE2</i> encoding ARPs was highly induced and regulated by Zur. ARPs do not need zinc as a structural component and support MSMEG survival upon zinc limitation (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>). Higher expression of such genes under limiting zinc conditions has also been described for MTB, MAP, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</span>, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Streptomyces coelicolor,</span> and other bacteria (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Concerning zinc export in MSMEG, our results revealed that expression of the zinc exporter MSMEG ZitA, encoded by MSMEG_0755, was directly regulated by SmtB, which is in accordance with findings on MTB ZitA (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>). Thus, MSMEG seems to possess zinc storage and transport mechanisms similar to those of pathogenic mycobacteria. However, in contrast to pathogenic mycobacteria, the MSMEG zinc regulon comprises additional putative zinc uptake systems, such as the predicted Zn uptake transporter encoded by MSMEG_6049-6051 or <i>mspD</i> (MSMEG_6057). The <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium smegmatis</span> <span data-style=""underline"">p</span>orins (Msp) represent a group of four highly similar proteins (MspA to -D) specific for mycobacteria. MspA is involved in the uptake of glucose (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), phosphate (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>), amino acid (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>), and iron (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>), and MspC is involved in copper uptake and growth (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). MspD differs from the other Msps in 18 amino acids only, but no substrate specificity has been described so far. Our study indicates that MspD may play a role in zinc uptake and might presumably provide an additional rapid channel-based exchange system for nutrients. Remarkably, MSMEG_6049, which is part of the MSMEG_6049-6051 operon, showed no homology to genes of pathogenic mycobacteria but to MVAN_5323 of the nonpathogenic <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Mycobacterium vanbaalenii</span>. This gene is predicted to be part of a second Zur-regulated <i>znuABC</i> transporter. Due to the observed high expression in MSMEG treated with TPEN and in MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i>, the transporter operon MSMEG_6049-6051 might, therefore, encode an additional zinc importer in MSMEG. With regard to mycobacterial phylogeny, the absence of these transport systems in pathogenic mycobacteria suggests a better zinc availability in the host. In the concept of phylogenetic adaptation of pathogens to their host, this might have led to the loss of additional uptake systems.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our analyses unraveled the transcriptional regulation of the MSMEG <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon. The results indicate that in MSMEG, as with zinc import, regulation of zinc homeostasis also seems to be more complex than in pathogenic mycobacteria. SmtB and Zur are both sensitive measures of zinc concentration in other bacteria (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>). Expression of the operon is autoregulated by SmtB in MTB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>) and/or is zinc dependent, as shown for MAP (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Here, we found that in MSMEGwt, expression of <i>smtB</i> and <i>zur</i> was unaffected when zinc was either absent or in excess (<a href=""#tab1"">Tables 1</a> and <a href=""#tab2"">2</a>; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4</a> in the supplemental material). This finding is in accordance with that in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">S. coelicolor,</span> in which the amount of Zur protein under high or low zinc conditions remained constant (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). Strikingly, the apparently constitutive expression of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> in MSMEG was maintained by SmtB and Zur, depending on the availability of zinc. We found that both regulators affect the expression of their operon. Our promoter studies with the regulator deletion mutants revealed that both SmtB and Zur are needed for full regulatory control of their operon promoter. Furthermore, we showed that the regulation of <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is hierarchic. Zur seems to dominate the control and represses expression of the operon when zinc is freely available for the bacterium (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>). We further show antagonistic binding of one regulator to the operator in the absence of the other (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a> and <a href=""#fig5"">D</a>). Hence, even in the case of imbalances in zinc homeostasis, expression of the operon is never uncontrolled. The importance of controlled <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression is also indicated by our zone of inhibition (ZoI) assays (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig. 2D</a> to <a href=""#fig2"">F</a>). They show that differential gene expression in MSMEG lacking Zur or SmtB results in reduced zinc tolerance, which is not observable when both regulators are absent in the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant. Thus, the regulons of Zur and SmtB are necessary for maintaining MSMEG zinc homeostasis. If uncontrolled, differential gene expression alone cannot cope with zinc imbalances, which is illustrated by the reduced zinc tolerance of the MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> double mutant when exposed to high zinc concentrations in the ZoI assays. However, the quality of zinc imbalances in the MSMEG single mutants needs to be clarified in future experiments. The antagonistic influence of Zur and SmtB on <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> expression has not yet been reported for other bacteria. On first glance, such an autoregulation seems to be peculiar. However, a closer look reveals that it is necessary for a sensitive control of zinc homeostasis. In the case of sole regulation by Zur, the operon would be derepressed upon zinc limitation. This might lead to excessive synthesis of apo-Zur and may delay or impair the shutdown of zinc importers when zinc is sufficiently available. Moreover, additional SmtB produced simultaneously would impair its own deactivation and block zinc export to avoid zinc excess. On the other hand, sole regulation by SmtB would allow operon expression exclusively when MSMEG encounters an excess of zinc, or it would depend on the half-life of SmtB, since SmtB binds to the DNA in its apo form (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a> and <a href=""#fig6"">6A</a>). This mechanism might be likely in organisms with stable zinc homeostasis. However, due to limited apo-Zur production, this mechanism would be disadvantageous for controlling zinc import after starvation. Therefore, the better capability to react quickly to changing zinc concentrations might also explain why Zur is the dominating regulator in this complex regulatory mechanism. The dominance of Zur also makes sense, as the environmental bioavailability of zinc is presumably low. Accordingly, in liquid culture, growth of MSMEG was hampered only in the absence of <i>zur</i> (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>), which might be explained by an uncontrolled zinc influx due to the lack of counterregulation. This, however, needs to be proven by additional studies in the future.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In pathogenic MTB, <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> regulation seems to be solely affected by SmtB (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>). This suggests that mycobacteria in the host are exposed to more constant or higher zinc concentrations than they are in the environment, which would make regulation by SmtB more plausible and might reflect another example of mycobacterial adaptation to the host.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overall, in the present study, we provide novel insights into the response of MSMEG to changing zinc concentrations. We show that MSMEG is well adapted to environmental changes in zinc availability. This is achieved by a sensitive regulation of the <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> operon by both Zur and SmtB, allowing a balanced expression of the two regulators even under changing zinc concentrations and by the presence of additional putative zinc transporters in the genome. These mechanisms enable MSMEG to maintain reactivity and to constantly control intracellular zinc homeostasis.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">The generation of MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> was described earlier (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> were constructed using the p2NIL/pGOAL19 system (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>) (Addgene plasmids 20188 and 20190). Briefly, 1,500âbp upstream (A) and downstream (B) fragments flanking MSMEG_4486 (Î<i>smtB</i>, primers 1 to 4) or the operon MSMEG_4486-87 (Î<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i>, primers 1/2 and 5/6) were amplified from genomic DNA by standard PCR using Phusion or Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). Fragments were cloned into pJET1.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced. Plasmids containing the correct sequence were restriction digested with either HindIII/BsmBI (A) or BsmBI/KpnI (B) in the case of Î<i>smtB</i> and with HindIII/BbsI (A) or BbsI/KpnI (B) in the case of Î<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i>. The fragments were subsequently ligated to HindIII/KpnI-digested p2NIL, resulting in deletion plasmids p2NIL-MSMEG4486AB and p2NIL-MSMEG4486-87AB. A marker gene cassette from pGOAL19, digested with PacI, was then ligated into the deletion plasmids, designated p2NIL-MSMEG4486-Del and p2NIL-MSMEG4486-87-Del. MSMEGwt competent cells were electroporated with 1 to 5âÎ¼g of plasmid DNA which had been pretreated with 100 mJ UV light cm<sup>â2</sup>. Selection of mutants was performed as described by Parish and Stoker (<a href=""#B57"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B57"">57</a>) with minor modifications as described earlier (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Mutants were screened by PCR using primers 7 to 12.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Homologous complementation of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i>Î<i>zur</i> was achieved by reintroducing <i>smtB</i> (MSMEG_4486) and <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4486-87), respectively, both under the control of their own promoter, by PCR cloning from genomic DNA of MSMEGwt using primers 13/14 and 13/15, respectively. MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> was complemented with <i>zur</i> (MSMEG_4487) under the control of the <i>smtB</i> promoter. For this, genomic DNA of MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> was used as the template for PCR with primers 13/14. The PCR fragments were digested with HindIII/XbaI and ligated to HindIII/XbaI-digested pMV306hyg. The resulting plasmids were designated pMV-MS<i>smtB</i>, pMV-MS<i>smtBzur</i> and pMV-MS<i>zur</i>, sequenced, and subsequently transformed into the corresponding mutant. Complemented strains were designated MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>, MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>, and MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>C</sup>Î<i>zur</i><sup>C</sup>. In addition, for the ChIP assay, MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i> were complemented with a plasmid harboring a Flag-tagged <i>smtB</i> gene (pMV-MS<i>smtB</i><sup>Flag</sup>) and an HA-tagged <i>zur</i> gene, respectively (pMV-MS<i>zur</i><sup>HA</sup>). pMV-MS<i>smtB</i><sup>Flag</sup> was obtained by inverse PCR of pMV-MS<i>smtB</i> with primers 16/17 using Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), pMV-MS<i>zur</i><sup>HA</sup> was constructed by ligation of AgeI/HindIII-digested pMV-MS<i>zur</i> and AgeI/HindIII-digested PCR product, which was generated with primers 18/19. After sequencing of the plasmid, successful Flag tag expression was confirmed via Western blot analysis (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1A</a> and <a href=""#figS1"">C</a>) and functional complementation by qRT-PCR using primers 9 to 12 and 20 to 23, targeting <i>smtB</i>, <i>zur</i>, <i>zitA</i>, and MSMEG_6069 (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1B</a> and <a href=""#figS1"">D</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Total RNA for transcriptome analysis was prepared from cultures in MB. MSMEG strains were grown in MB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 2.0. MSMEGwt cultures for zinc starvation or excess were divided in two and subsequently treated with 10âÎ¼M TPEN or 100, 500, and 1,000âÎ¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> or were left untreated (control) for 2 h. RNA deep sequencing of MSMEGwt treated with TPEN or zinc and MSMEG mutants was performed as described before (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). The quality and integrity value RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt;8 of total RNA was controlled on an Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer or checked by a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The RNA sequencing libraries were generated from 250âng total RNA using a Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (bacteria) (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for rRNA depletion, followed by a ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicentre, WI, USA) according to the manufacturersâ protocols. Briefly, 50-bp single-end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 or a NovaSeq 6000 PE50 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a mean output of 15âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> reads per sample. BWA v. 0.7.5 was applied for the alignment of sequences against the reference strain MSMEG mc<sup>2</sup> 155 (NCBI accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_008596"">NC_008596</a>) with an average mapping rate of 90% and a share of rRNAs around 6%.

<div role=""paragraph"">Strains MSMEGÎ<i>smtB</i><sup>CFlag</sup> and MSMEGÎ<i>zur</i><sup>CHA</sup> were grown in MB to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 2.0 as described before and treated with 10âÎ¼M TPEN or 100âÎ¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub> for 2 h or left untreated (control). Cultures were then cross-linked with 1% methanol-free formaldehyde for 20âmin at room temperature on a rolling incubator. The reaction was quenched with 0.125 M glycine, cells were harvested and washed twice with 50âmM Tris-HClâplusâ10âmM EDTA (pH 7.5), and lysates were prepared as described by Eckelt et al. (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>) with minor modifications. Cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl plus EDTA (pH 7.5) buffer and lysed in a ribolyzer, and DNA was sheared by sonification (ultrasonic intensity duty cycle constant) for 20âmin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (11,000âÃâ<i>g</i>, 30âmin, 4Â°C). Protein concentration was determined by MicroBCA as described previously (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as follows: 250âÎ¼g protein from lysates was mixed with 30âÎ¼l salmon sperm DNAâprotein A/G agarose matrix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA) and 2âÎ¼g anti-DYKDDDK (Flag) antibody or IgG2a rat antibody (unspecific binding control) for SmtB-Flag ChIP and 2âÎ¼g anti-HA antibody or IgG1Îº mouse antibody for Zur-HA ChIP (all antibodies from BioLegend, CA, USA), and samples were adjusted with ChIP DLP buffer {16.7âmM Tris-HCl, 1.2âmM, 167âmM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1âmM AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride], pH 8.0} to a final total volume of 800âÎ¼l and incubated overnight at 4Â°C (rotating incubator). Protein A/G-antibody-DNA complexes were pelleted, and 100âÎ¼l of the supernatant from each sample was retained as input control. Beads were washed as described by Braunstein et al. (<a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>) and finally resuspended in 55âÎ¼l 10âmM Tris-HClâ1âmM EDTAâ1% SDS buffer (pH 8.0). DNA-protein complexes were eluted from agarose beads by heating (1,200ârpm, 30âmin, 70Â°C) and centrifugation (11,000âÃâ<i>g</i>, 30âs, 4Â°C). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted with 150âÎ¼l TE buffer (10âmM Tris-HCl, 1âmM EDTA, pH 8.0). DNA from ChIP and input samples was isolated upon treatment with RNase (250âÎ¼g/ml) for 30âmin at 37Â°C, proteinase K (1âÎ¼g/ml) for 2 h at 37Â°C, and 160âmM NaCl at 65Â°C overnight, followed by standard phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and precipitation in the presence of 40âÎ¼g glycogen with 140âmM LiCl and ethanol 99.8% for 30âmin at room temperature. DNA was pelleted, washed with 80% ethanol, and dissolved in distilled water. DNA from ChIP was analyzed by qRT-PCR in a total volume of 20âÎ¼l containing 2âÎ¼l of ChIP-DNA, 10âÎ¼l SYBR green mix (Qiagen), and 200 nM specific primers by using a Stratagene MX3005P cycler. Primer pairs were selected for either the <i>smtB</i> and <i>zitA</i> promoter (primers 30 to 33) or intragenic controls (primers 34 to 37). For primer efficacy, 1 Î¼g of each input DNA was pooled, serially diluted, and used for every single primer pair (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The PCR conditions were 95Â°C for 20âmin, 95Â°C for 45âs, 58Â°C for 1âmin, and 72Â°C for 1âmin, followed by a melting curve of the product as the control. Data were analyzed as follows: in a first step, threshold cycle (<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) values of the input were subtracted from <i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of antibody-treated samples (Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>). Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of isotype controls (IgG2a, IgG1Îº) were then subtracted from Î<i>C<sub>T</sub></i> values of anti-Flag- or anti-HA-precipitated samples (ÎÎ<i>C<sub>T</sub></i>) and calculated as log<sub>2</sub> to determine the relative fold change.

<div role=""paragraph"">Differentially expressed genes obtained by Rockhopper analysis were further analyzed with NCBI blastx and the TB database (<a href=""http://genome.tbdb.org"">http://genome.tbdb.org</a>) to identify putative protein functions. Putative Zur binding sites in MSMEG (accession no. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_008596"">NC_008596</a>) were identified by FIMO analysis.

Identification of bacteria with adjacent <i>smtB</i> and <i>zur</i> genes was performed using NCBI BLASTN (<a href=""https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&amp;PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;LINK_LOC=blasthome"">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&amp;PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;LINK_LOC=blasthome</a>) with the nucleotide sequence <i>smtB</i>-<i>zur</i> of MSMEG (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_008596"">NC_008596</a>), bases 4569200 to 4569951. BLASTN was set as follows: database nucleotide collection (nr/nt), exclude models (XM/XP) and uncultured/environmental sample sequences. Hits were filtered (query cover, 85 to 100%; identity, 75 to 100%), and one strain of each species was selected for further analysis, with the exception of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. avium,</span> for which the two subspecies <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. avium</span> subsp. <i>hominissuis</i> and <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">M. avium</span> subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i> were used. A âdistance tree of resultsâ was generated in NCBI (tree method, neighbor joining; maximum sequence difference, 0.75), and the homologous sequences were downloaded. These were used for a multiple MAFFT alignment in Geneious. If a strain exhibited two or more homologous sequences of different sizes, the longest homologous sequence was kept for tree building with the Geneious tree builder (genetic distance model, Jukes Cantor; tree building method, unweighted pair group method using average linkages [UPGMA]).

Forty-four strains (69%) were resistant to at least 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml. All six strains from infants, but only 24% of strains from adults, were sensitive (<i>P</i> = 0.0031). Representative Mtz-resistant (Mtz<sup>r</sup>) strains were rendered Mtz susceptible (Mtz<sup>s</sup>) by transformation with a functional <i>rdxA</i> gene; conversely, Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains were rendered Mtz<sup>r</sup> by <i>rdxA</i> inactivation. Many mutations were found by Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> <i>rdxA</i> sequencing; mutations that probably inactivated <i>rdxA</i> in Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains were identified and explained using RdxA protein's structure. All of the strains were sensitive to clarithromycin and erythromycin. Amoxicillin and tetracycline resistance was rare. Sequence analysis indicated that most tetracycline resistance, when found, was not due to 16S rRNA gene mutations. These data suggest caution in the use of Mtz-based therapies in The Gambia. The increasing use of macrolides against respiratory infections in The Gambia calls for continued antibiotic susceptibility monitoring. The rich variety of <i>rdxA</i> mutations that we found will be useful in further structure-function studies of RdxA, the enzyme responsible for Mtz susceptibility in this important pathogen.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Helicobacter pylori</span> chronically infects most people in developing countries (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>), typically starting in infancy (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">â</a><a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>) and lasting for life. It also remains a significant pathogen in industrialized countries, infecting some 10 to 40% of adults in many societies. Chronic <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> infection is a major cause of gastric (stomach) and duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a><a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). It also increases the risk of infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens, iron deficiency anemia, and infant malnutrition and growth faltering, especially among the very poor (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). These latter conditions are of particular concern in The Gambia, a small developing country on the West Coast of Africa. Fortunately, many <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>-associated illnesses can be prevented or cured by the timely eradication of the bacterium, which typically entails a 1 to 2 weeks of treatment variously with metronidazole (Mtz), amoxicillin (Amo), and clarithromycin (Cla), when affordable, and/or tetracycline (Tet), in combination with a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole, and/or bismuth, where allowed by local regulations (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> transmission tends to be highly localized and preferentially intrafamilial (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>) in industrialized societies and often also between households in the local community in developing country settings (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). Given the relatively localized transmission, successful eradication from many members of a household or community might markedly diminish the risk of new infections, especially of newborns, and thereby contribute importantly to public health.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Resistance to useful antimicrobials, especially Mtz and Cla, has been a major problem in some societies, even among people not previously treated for their <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> infections. Such resistance is generally attributable to inadvertent <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> exposure during treatment for other conditions (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Mtz itself is an innocuous prodrug that is activated by chemical reduction to hydroxylamine type compounds, which are bactericidal to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). In the strains studied to date, mostly from industrialized societies, a modest level of Mtz resistance (e.g., to 8 or 16 Î¼g of Mtz/ml) was usually associated with inactivation of the gene <i>rdxA</i>, which encodes a nonessential oxygen-insensitive NAPDH nitroreductase that chemically reduces Mtz <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>). Higher-level resistance in <i>rdxA</i> mutant strains, e.g., to 32 Î¼g of Mtz/ml, resulted from the inactivation of <i>frxA</i>, a related but generally less strongly transcribed nitroreductase gene; however, higher-level resistance can result from mutations in any of several additional genes that likely also affect intracellular redox potential (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a><a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">â</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). The hydroxylamine-type derivatives of Mtz that RdxA protein generates are mutagenic, such that exposure to sublethal Mtz concentrations (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>) induces as well as selects for mutations to Mtz resistance.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">No commonly used anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> drugs other than Mtz are known to require activation to render them bactericidal, nor to be so highly mutagenic. In addition, the several resistances to these other drugs identified to date involve specific mutational changes that alter the target's function. In particular, resistance to the related macrolides erythromycin (Ery) and clarithromycin (Cla), which are used in anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> therapy, is usually achieved by point mutations at either of two adjacent sites in 23S rRNA (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>, <a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a>) that diminish macrolide binding to the ribosome. Cla resistance seems to be rare in many societies but common (more than one-fourth of strains) in others (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). The observed prevalence probably reflects a combination of the very few rRNA sites in which sequence changes can confer resistance and are not too deleterious for the bacterium, a need to incorporate any resistance mutation in both 23S rRNA genes to achieve a resistance phenotype, and the intensity of macrolide use for other infections and thereby inadvertent exposure of resident <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Tet resistance is much rarer than Mtz or Cla resistance (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), although several bona fide resistant strains have been identified and analyzed. In the best-described case, modest resistance resulted from three contiguous changes in the Tet binding pocket in 16S rRNA (positions 965 to 967) (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Lower-level resistance was achieved by mutation at one or two of these positions and/or by mutations in genes in other chromosomal locations that have not yet been identified but are suspected to affect bacterial permeability or efflux (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). Amo resistance is also very rare, but where it is found it has been ascribed to mutation in a penicillin-binding protein involved in cell wall metabolism (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a><a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27 B28 B29"">â</a><a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The present study of drug susceptibility and resistance in Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains was motivated in part by considering that <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> is a genetically very diverse species, with different genotypes predominating in different well-separated geographic regions, even in different parts of Africa (<a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>) and that most studies of drug susceptibility and resistance have focused on strains from Europe, the Americas, or Asia. As with many infection-related topics, there have been far fewer critical studies of antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains from Africa, especially those from West Africaâthe ancestral home of most people of African ethnicity in the Americas. Given <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> transmission preferentially within families and local communities (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a><a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">â</a><a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), West African strains may well have contributed to <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> gene pools in the Americas.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bearing in mind <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>'s impact on public health worldwide, The Gambia included, and the distinctiveness of African strains, we assessed here the frequencies of resistance to Amo, Cla, Ery, Mtz, and Tet in a set of 64 strains from Gambian citizens. We tested the importance of <i>rdxA</i> status for Mtz susceptibility and resistance by transformation and DNA sequence analysis, and interpreted amino acid sequence differences in RdxA protein in terms of its recently determined structure (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). We also tested by DNA sequencing whether 16S rRNA gene mutations could be responsible for the very few Tet-resistant (Tet<sup>r</sup>) isolates found as minority components of mixed <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> populations from several patient biopsy specimens.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1"" data-type=""subjects""><h3>Patients.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the present study: 35 male and 29 female, ranging from 18 months to 70 years, with a mean age of 30 years. These patients were part of a group recruited during a primary study of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> genetic diversity reported previously (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). All subjects were Gambian citizens and provided written informed consent. Children younger than 18 years were enrolled only after parental/guardian written informed consent. The study was approved by the Gambia Government/MRC joint ethics committee and the international Review Board of the U.S. National Institute of Health Division of Microbiology Infectious Diseases.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Bacterial cultures.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains were cultured, generally as pools of bacteria, from gastric biopsy samples on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar (Difco, USA) supplemented with 7% horse blood, 0.4% IsoVitaleX, trimethoprim at 5 Î¼g/liter, vancomycin at 6 Î¼g/liter, and amphotericin at 8 Î¼g/liter. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C in a microaerobic atmosphere for 3 days as previously described (<a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33"">33</a>). Exponential growth of these strains was obtained by culturing on fresh BHI agar medium for 24 h. Strains were stored at â70Â°C as suspensions of fresh exponentially growing cells suspended in BHI broth with 20% glycerol.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>MIC determined by agar dilution.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Freshly grown bacteria were screened for antibiotic resistance by suspending them in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) (Invitrogen, USA) at a 10<sup>5</sup> McFarland standard. A series of sequential 10-fold dilutions was prepared from this suspension, and 10 Î¼l of each dilution was spot inoculated onto BHI medium containing antibiotics appropriate for this experiment as follows: Amo (2 Î¼g/ml), Cla (2 Î¼g/ml), Ery (2 Î¼g/ml), Tet (2 Î¼g/ml), and Mtz (8 Î¼g/ml). When resistance was encountered, susceptibility to higher concentrations of the antibiotic was tested. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C under microaerobic conditions for 5 days. A strain was considered to be susceptible to a concentration of an antibiotic that caused at least a 10-fold decrease in the efficiency of colony formation by individual cells (efficiency of plating [EOP]) as previously described (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>DNA extraction.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Total genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (rDNA minikit; Qiagen, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's guidelines and stored at â20Â°C.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>RAPD-PCR.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">RAPD [random(ly) amplified polymorphic DNA] typing was carried out using two arbitrary primers (1254 [5â²-CCGCAGCCAA-3â²] and 1283 [5â²-GCGATCCCCA-3â²]) as previously described (<a href=""#B35"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B35"">35</a>). The cycling parameters were 45 cycles of 94Â°C for 1 min, 36Â°C for 1 min, and 72Â°C for 2 min. The amplified products were detected by electrophoresis on a 1.5% (vol/vol) agarose gel with ethidium bromide (500 ng/ml), and the bands were visualized by using Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>16S rRNA gene and <i>rdxA</i> gene sequencing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To detect changes in 16S rRNA sequences associated with Tet resistance, 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with the primers 16S-F (5â²-CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTTCAC-3â²) and 16S-R (5â²-TATGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTC-3â²), and the amplified 16S rRNA genes were sequenced as previously described (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). To detect mutations associated with Mtz resistance, the <i>rdxA</i> genes of 51 strains (33 Mtz<sup>r</sup> and 18 Mtz<sup>s</sup>) were amplified by PCR with the primers rdxAF (5â²-GTTTCGTTAGGGATTTTATTGTATGCTA-3â²) and rdxAR (5â²-CACCCCTAAAAGAGCGATTAAAACCATT-3â²), the PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences were edited, aligned, and analyzed by using the DNAStar program (version 7; Lasergene, USA) and the Clustalw2 program.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-7""><h3>Mutant RdxA protein structure analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The impact on protein structure of mutations found in <i>rdxA</i> genes from Mtz<sup>r</sup> and Mtz<sup>s</sup><i>H pylori</i> strains was assessed by modeling the mutations in the X-ray structure of the RdxA enzyme (PDB ID 3QDL) (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>) using Swiss-PdbViewer (<a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>). Distances from mutated residues to flavin mononucleotide (FMN) atoms or to the closest atoms of the associated monomer of the RdxA dimer were also calculated using Swiss-Pdbviewer. Solvent exposure of mutated residues was calculated using the ProtSA server (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). Proteins encoded by genes with insertion, deletion, or nonsense (stop) codon mutations were not modeled. Individual point mutations at the protein surface and far from the FMN group and dimer interface were considered to be neutral and did not affect RdxA function. Mutations resulting in small to large residue replacement at the protein core or leading to the loss of hydrogen bonds between apoprotein and FMN, the burial of polar or charged residues, or the replacement of Gly residues exhibiting dihedral angles not allowed to other residues were regarded as structurally disruptive and thus potentially causing the loss of RdxA function.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-8""><h3>Statistical analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Comparisons of antimicrobial resistance in strains from children versus adults, males versus females, and the distribution of <i>rdxA</i> nonsense mutations in different groups of strains were determined using the Fisher exact test; a <i>P</i> value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Of the 64 strains tested for Mtz susceptibility, 20 (31.2%) were sensitive (single cells unable to form colonies) on medium with Mtz at 8 Î¼g/ml, and 44 (68.8%) were resistant. All six strains from infants (18 to 31 months old) were sensitive to this modest level of Mtz, whereas only 14 (24%) of 58 strains from adults were sensitive (<i>P</i> = 0.0031; <a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a>). The prevalence of Mtz resistance in males versus females was 66% versus 72%, respectively (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05; <a href=""#T1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""#F1"">Fig. 1</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">All but 3 of the 44 strains that were resistant to 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml also grew well on medium with 16 Î¼g of Mtz/ml. In addition, 28 of these strains also grew on medium with 32 Î¼g of Mtz/ml; and 2 of the 28 grew on medium with 64 Î¼g of Mtz/ml. None of our 44 strains grew on medium with 128 Î¼g of Mtz/ml (<a href=""#F2"">Fig. 2</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">In further tests of strains that did not grow with 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml, 2 of the 6 representative strains from infants (18 to 31 months old), and 2 of 14 representative strains from adults grew on medium with only 4 Î¼g of Mtz/ml.</div>
<section id=""sec-3-1""><h3>
<i>rdxA</i> (nitroreductase) gene analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A transformation test was used to determine whether Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains were distinct metabolically from most susceptible reference strains in requiring more than just <i>rdxA</i> inactivation to achieve Mtz resistance (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a><a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">â</a><a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). Eleven Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains were transformed with genomic DNA from a derivative of strain 26695 whose <i>rdxA</i> gene had been replaced with a chloramphenicol-resistant (Cam<sup>r</sup>) cassette (Î<i>rdxA-cat</i>). Each of the 10 to 20 Cam<sup>r</sup> transformant colonies tested from each of the 11 strain transformations grew well on agar with 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml. This outcome indicates that most or all Mtz<sup>s</sup> Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains are just one mutational (<i>rdxA</i> inactivation) step away from becoming resistant. In a converse experiment, we tested whether mutation in <i>rdxA</i> was important for the resistance of Mtz<sup>r</sup> Gambian strains. This entailed transforming 12 representative Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains with genomic DNA from an <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strain containing a kanamycin-resistant (Kan<sup>r</sup>) cassette inserted next to a functional <i>rdxA</i> gene. We expected that a fraction of Kan<sup>r</sup> transformants would acquire the donor strain's <i>rdxA</i><sup>+</sup> (functional) allele (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), even though most might retain the recipient <i>rdxA</i> mutant allele because <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> transformation tends to involve mostly short DNA fragments (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). At least 2 of the 20 to 30 Kan<sup>r</sup> transformants scored from each of 12 Mtz<sup>r</sup> recipient strains were found to be Mtz<sup>s</sup> on agar with 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml, even though most Kan<sup>r</sup> transformants remained Mtz<sup>r</sup>. We infer that these few Kan<sup>r</sup> Mtz<sup>s</sup> transformants had gained the donor's functional <i>rdxA</i> allele and thereby conclude that <i>rdxA</i> inactivation is needed for most or all Mtz<sup>s</sup> Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains if they are to become Mtz<sup>r</sup>.</div></section><section id=""sec-3-2""><h3>Sequence comparison of <i>rdxA</i> from Mtz<sup>r</sup> and Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>rdxA</i> gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from 33 Mtz<sup>r</sup> (MIC range, 8 to 32 Î¼g/ml) and 18 Mtz<sup>s</sup> Gambian strains (MIC &lt; 8 Î¼g/ml). The average <i>rdxA</i> sequence diversities were 3.6% in Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains and 3.4% in Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains (3.5% overall), which is within the range of diversities among Gambian strain housekeeping genes (range, 1.2 to 4.6%; mean, 2.9%), and whose protein products also act internally in these Gambian strains (O. Secka, unpublished data).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Of the 33 Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains characterized, 15 (45.5%) contained nonsense (translation stop) codons within the <i>rdxA</i> orf, including 13 of the 19 resistant to 32 Î¼g of Mtz/ml; in contrast, only 2 of the 14 isolates with lower-level resistance (8 to 16 Î¼g/ml) contained nonsense mutations in <i>rdxA</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.004, <a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>). This difference in distribution is in accord with nonsense mutations causing protein truncation and thus a complete loss of RdxA function. Some missense mutations diminish but do not entirely eliminate an encoded protein's activity and thus would confer only leaky phenotypes (lower-level Mtz resistance in the case of <i>rdxA</i>), whereas many others would be well tolerated and have little if any effect on activity of the encoded protein.</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""T2"" class=""table""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Three of 33 Mtz<sup>r</sup> (9.0%) strains had insertions of one or two nucleotides and thereby <i>rdxA</i> frameshift mutations, which would result in new amino acid sequences distal to the mutant site and thereby loss of <i>rdxA</i> function. In addition, two strains contained in-frame deletions of 3 and 21 nucleotides, which do not cause changes in RdxA protein sequences distal to the mutant sites. Thirteen of 33 (39%) Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains had neither translation stop nor indel mutations in <i>rdxA</i>, but their <i>rdxA</i> alleles differed from those in Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains by numerous substitutions. Consideration of translation products in terms of <i>H pylori</i> RdxA protein's recently reported tridimensional structure (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>) (PDB ID 3QDL) identified nine substitutions found only in Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains (S43L, P44L, and G163D [each in two strains] and A80I, A80T, C87Y, S158R, G189C, and A206T [each in one strain]) that are likely to have decreased RdxA function due to effects on stability, dimerization, and FMN binding and also indicated that the many other differences might not interfere with these best understood of RdxA protein's functional properties. One substitution found in Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains, R16H, that should decrease FMN binding affinity was also found in an Mtz<sup>s</sup> strain.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The basis of Mtz resistance in two strains (127R and 104R, MIC = 32 Î¼g/ml) is not clear from RdxA structure considerations. Their 210-residue RdxA proteins differ at many positions from the RdxA protein whose structure was determined (Hp0954 of reference strain 26695). However, all of the differences present in strain 127R (D59N, R90K, G98S, R131K, V172I, A183V, Q197K, and V204I) and most (Q6H, D59N, R90K, G98S, R131K, E133K, G170S, V172I, E175Q, A183V, E194K, Q197K, and V204I) in 104R were also present in many other resistant and susceptible strains and thus may not perturb function. We interpret that most of these differences simply reflect neutral mutations in accord with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>'s great genetic diversity. None of the three mutations that were specific to 104R (E133K, G170S, and E194K) is expected to affect RdxA function because they appeared on the protein surface far from the FMN binding site. Thus, why strains 127R and 104R were resistant is not obvious: possibly their particular combinations of changes in RdxA diminished function (conferred resistance), or these strains might have polar mutations in the upstream DNA that we did not sequence.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Among the 18 <i>rdxA</i> sequences from Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains, 3 (17%) had internal stop codons (<a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>), and 3 others had point mutations that also might lead to <i>rdxA</i> inactivation, R16H (in one strain) because it should decrease RdxA affinity for FMNâ²s negatively charged phosphate and A67V (in two strains) because it entails replacement of small alanine by bulky valine in the protein core, although direct tests are needed to learn how severely this replacement affects protein stability and function. If these mutations do indeed cause <i>rdxA</i> inactivation, the Mtz<sup>s</sup> phenotypes might stem from high-level <i>frxA</i> expression (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>); the possibility of nonsense suppressor mutant tRNAs in certain strains also merits consideration. The nonsense mutations between Mtz<sup>s</sup> and Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains to 32 Î¼g of Mtz/ml was significant (<i>P</i> = 0.0025, <a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>); however, overall, the nonsense mutations between Mtz<sup>s</sup> and Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains was not (<i>P</i> = 0.065, <a href=""#T2"">Table 2</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Fifteen substitutions were found only in Mtz<sup>r</sup> isolates (H25R, S43L, P44L, A80I, A80T, C87Y, H97T, E133K, S158R, G163D, G170S, G189C, E194K D205A, and A206T), which suggests that some of them might decrease RdxA function. Conversely, five were only found in Mtz<sup>s</sup> isolates (S30G, T31A, A67V, A68V, and Q197R) and thus might be neutral (of these five, only A67V is suspected of decreasing RdxA function, as noted above).</div></section><section id=""sec-3-3""><h3>Susceptibility of Gambian strains to other antibiotics.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All 64 of our Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> cultures grown directly from gastric biopsy specimens were found to be highly sensitive to the closely related macrolides Cla and Ery. All cultures were also Tet<sup>s</sup> and Amo<sup>s</sup> (<a href=""#T3"">Table 3</a>), although one and four of them contained rare Amo<sup>r</sup> and Tet<sup>r</sup> cells able to grow on medium with 2 Î¼g of Amo or Tet/ml, respectively (frequencies of 10<sup>â3</sup> to 10<sup>â4</sup>). Further tests of one Tet<sup>r</sup> colony from each of these unusual Tet<sup>r</sup> subclone-containing cultures showed that their MICs ranged from 2 to 4 Î¼g of Tet/ml and that each was indistinguishable by RAPD-DNA fingerprinting from the predominant Tet<sup>s</sup> strains from the same biopsy specimen (data not shown). These four sets of strains were not closely related to one another, as expected, since they came from different persons. We found that the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene of each Tet<sup>r</sup> strain was identical in sequence to that of its Tet<sup>s</sup> sibling from the same biopsy specimen. We conclude that in each of these four cases, Tet resistance is due to mutation in a gene distinct from that for 16S rRNA.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">
<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> infection contributes importantly to several human diseases in both developing and industrialized countries and directly impacts on health care systems worldwide. Its public health impact is of particular concern in developing countries because the prevalence of infection is so very high (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we scored susceptibility and resistance to clinically relevant anti-<span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> agents using a test of efficiency of colony formation by single cells. This test is especially useful for scoring susceptibility to Mtz because Mtz can be both mutagenic and bactericidal; it both induces and selects for resistance mutations (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>, <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). We found that more than two-thirds of Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains were Mtz<sup>r</sup>. This high prevalence can be explained by the relative low cost and easy availability of Mtz in The Gambia, as is typical of developing countries worldwide. Our results are in accord with other reports of many Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains elsewhere in Africa (Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa Cameroon, and Egypt) (<a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40"">40</a><a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41 B42"">â</a><a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>), India, and Latin America (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>, <a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>). Typically, somewhat less than half of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains from Europe and North America have been found to be Mtz<sup>r</sup> (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>), likely reflecting the tighter control of Mtz usage in industrialized than in developing countries. Our observation that all six strains from infants (18 to 31 months of age) were sensitive to 8 Î¼g of Mtz/ml, in contrast to 24% of those from older people (â¥14 years) (<i>P</i> = 0.003), also merits further examination, especially in light of the possibility that <i>rdxA</i> function might contribute to fitness during the establishment of infection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Prior studies with other sets of strains had shown that Mtz resistance typically involves inactivation of <i>rdxA</i>, which encodes a nitroreductase that converts Mtz from prodrug to bactericidal agent by chemical reduction. However, <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains also contain a related gene, <i>frxA</i>, which also confers Mtz susceptibility if highly expressed, independent of <i>rdxA</i> status (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>). Our DNA transformation studies indicated that each of 11 Mtz<sup>s</sup> Gambian strains tested required only <i>rdxA</i> inactivation to gain a Mtz<sup>r</sup> phenotype and, conversely, that resistance involved <i>rdxA</i> inactivation in each of the 12 Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains tested.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Sequence analysis of <i>rdxA</i> genes from our strains identified loss-of-function mutations that should cause Mtz resistance similar to those found in previous studies (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). In particular, <i>rdxA</i> nonsense (stop codon) mutations were more common in strains with moderate level resistance (32 Î¼g/ml) than in strains with lower-level resistance (8 to 16 Î¼g/ml), in agreement with other findings (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). However, 3 of 18 Mtz<sup>s</sup> strains had <i>rdxA</i>-null nonsense mutations, and 3 others had point mutations that also possibly might result in inactive RdxA proteins. These observations are consistent with other reports (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>, <a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) that <i>rdxA</i> inactivation need not always lead to Mtz resistance and can be explained by postulating higher-level expression of the related <i>frxA</i> nitroreductase gene (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>, <a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We also found that most Mtz<sup>r</sup> strains had mutations scattered across the <i>rdxA</i> gene that are not likely to contribute to their resistant phenotype. This is in accord with <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>'s well-known great sequence diversity, seen here in the <i>rdxA</i> gene.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Increasingly frequent Cla resistance, up to one-fourth or more of <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains, has been reported in Europe and North America (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>, <a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>). High prevalence, where encountered, has been attributed to use of macrolides to treat respiratory infections (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a><a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">â</a><a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). In The Gambia, Ery is now routinely used to treat lower respiratory tract and skin infections. However, we found no resistance to Cla or Ery in the 64 <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> isolates we tested.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Tet and Amo are also much used. Tet, especially, is inexpensive and readily available in local drug stores in The Gambia, often without prescription. However, its easy availability did not result in much resistance in Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains: Tet<sup>r</sup> strains were recovered from pooled cultures from only four patients and then only as very rare cells in the population. This outcome is in accord with the rarity of Tet resistance in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> from other parts of the world (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). None of our four Tet<sup>r</sup> strains had mutational changes in the several allowed positions in the 16S rRNA Tet binding pocket that can result in modest Tet resistance (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>, <a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>). Thus, by default, their resistances are likely to stem from mutations in other lociâa class of mutations previously interpreted as more easily achieved but also likely to diminish <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> fitness (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). We propose that the low probability of mutation at just a few specific rRNA sites and the low fitness conferred by Tet resistance mutations in other genes explains the rarity of Tet<sup>r</sup><span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>, despite considerable exposure, in The Gambia. Resistance to Amo was also very rare in Gambian strains, much as has been reported for other geographic regions (<a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>, <a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>).</div>
<section id=""sec-4-1"" data-type=""conclusions""><h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The increased prevalence of resistance to antibiotics used against <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> is of great concern, especially in developing countries where the costs of even the least expensive first line drugs are a burden to average citizens. This contributes to the urgency of monitoring antibiotic resistant strain frequencies to help clinicians effectively manage patients and their antibiotic regimens and to effectively deal with treatment failure. The rich repertoire of <i>rdxA</i> mutations found in our many Gambian <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> strains should be useful for future studies of RdxA structure and function, of how RdxA and its FrxA homolog make <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span> susceptible to prodrugs such as Mtz, and of the roles of these two nitroreductase enzymes in <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">H. pylori</span>'s central metabolic networks.</div></section></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<section id=""sec-1""><h2>ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Bacteroidota phylum members have colonized a large spectrum of ecological niches, including soil, freshwater, marine and animal-associated, displaying rich metabolic potential. Bacteroidota emerged as a major freshwater bacterial lineage in 16S rRNA sequences analyses recovered from diverse aquatic habitats, playing a crucial role in degrading complex organic matter (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Unidentified Amoebozoa was nonaxenically cultured from a Lake ZÃ¼rich (47Â° 13â² 20.9994â³N, 8Â° 45â² 9.72â³E, Swiss Confederation) sample. The cultures were maintained in tissue culture flasks filled with 50âmL of autoclaved Swiss Alpina water (Pearlwater, Termen, Switzerland). <span class=""named-content"" data-type=""genus-species"">Planktothrix rubescens</span> strain A7 served as food source. The DNA of this culture was extracted using the MagAttract HMW DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). It was further purified with Beckman Coulter AMPure XP magnetic beads and subsequently used for metagenomic sequencing on a Nanopore PromethION platform using a FLO-PRO002 (R9.4.1) flow cell. The sequencing 1D library was constructed with the SQK-LSK110 Ligation Sequencing kit (ONT, Oxford, UK) in conformity with manufacturer's instructions without any prior DNA fragmentation or size selection.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Obtained reads (approx. 2 million reads; mean read length 9 kbp, median read quality 11.7, <i>N</i><sub>50</sub> 14.4 kbp) were basecalled and quality trimmed (Q score 7) with Guppy 5.1.15 prior to assembly with Flye 2.9-b1768 (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>). Potential contamination of the recovered circular chromosome (4 155 722âbp, coverage 115Ã) was assessed by CheckM v1.1.3 (94.89% complete, 0.63% contaminated) (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). Taxonomical classification was performed with GTDB-Tk v1.4.0 (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>) and by comparing its 16S rRNA, predicted by barrnap 0.9, against SILVA database v138 (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Prokka 1.12 (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) and NCBIâs PGAP pipeline were used for gene prediction and functional annotation. The assignment of KO identifiers to orthologous genes was performed by BlastKOALA (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Pathway reconstruction was accomplished with the online KEGG Mapper-Reconstruction tool using the obtained KO numbers. PFAM domains were predicted using the pfam_scan.pl script with the PFAM database release 32 (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). gRodon R package (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>) was applied to predict growth rates, while defense mechanisms diversity was explored with DefenseFinder (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>). Default parameters were used except where otherwise specified.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">GTDB-tk classified the obtained metagenome-assembled genome as belonging to an uncultivated order (AKYH767) within the Bacteroidota phylum. However, SILVA classification pointed toward Sphingobacteriales (88.45% identity) order within the same phylum. With a GC of 40.07%, the recovered metagenome-assembled genome exhibited four 869 CDS, 70 encoded transporters, and one rRNA operon. Genome-inferred metabolic reconstruction suggested a Gram-negative bacterium with fast duplication time (approx. 2.6 h) and an aerobic heterotrophic lifestyle. The circular chromosome (strain JAD_PAG50586_3) had the metabolic potential of synthesizing 50% of all proteinogenic amino acid as well as to degrade 60% of them. Anabolic (i.e., Gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis) and catabolic (i.e., TCA-cycle, pyruvate oxidation, fatty acids degradation) metabolisms were found complete. Interestingly, the recovered genome displayed seven different defense mechanisms. Gliding motility was inferred based on the presence of 11âkey genes.</div>

By substituting amino acids in the enzymatic A subunit that are highly conserved in all members of this family, we constructed 23 variants of CT that exhibited decreased or undetectable toxicity and we characterized their biological and biochemical properties. Many variants exhibited previously undescribed temperature-sensitive assembly of holotoxin and/or increased sensitivity to proteolysis, which in all cases correlated with exposure of epitopes of CT-A that are normally hidden in native CT holotoxin. Substitutions within and deletion of the entire active-site-occluding loop demonstrated a prominent role for His-44 and this loop in the structure and activity of CT. Several novel variants with wild-type assembly and stability showed significantly decreased toxicity and enzymatic activity (e.g., variants at positions R11, I16, R25, E29, and S68+V72). In most variants the reduction in toxicity was proportional to the decrease in enzymatic activity. For substitutions or insertions at E29 and Y30 the decrease in toxicity was 10- and 5-fold more than the reduction in enzymatic activity, but for variants with R25G, E110D, or E112D substitutions the decrease in enzymatic activity was 12- to 50-fold more than the reduction in toxicity. These variants may be useful as tools for additional studies on the cell biology of toxin action and/or as attenuated toxins for adjuvant or vaccine use.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div role=""paragraph"">The massive diarrhea characteristic of the disease cholera is in large part due to the action of cholera toxin (CT), produced by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> of serogroup O1. A better understanding of the structure and function of CT will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of cholera and may aid in the design of safe and effective vaccines against cholera and related diarrheas.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">CT is a heterohexameric complex consisting of one A polypeptide and five identical B polypeptides (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The B pentamer is required for binding to the cell surface receptor ganglioside GM<sub>1</sub> (<a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>). The A subunit can be proteolytically cleaved within the single disulfide-linked loop between C187 and C199 to produce the enzymatically active A1 polypeptide (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>) and the smaller A2 polypeptide that links fragment A1 to the B pentamer (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a>). Upon entry into enterocytes by endocytosis and following reduction and translocation, CT-A1 ADP-ribosylates a regulatory G-protein (GsÎ±), which leads to constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase, increased intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP, and secretion of fluid and electrolytes into the lumen of the small intestine (<a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>). ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of CT is stimulated in vitro by the presence of accessory proteins called ARFs (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>), small GTP-binding proteins known to be involved in vesicle trafficking within the eukaryotic cell, but the role of ARFs in the activity of CT in vivo has not yet been determined.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">CT is the prototype for the <i>V. cholerae-Escherichia coli</i>family of heat-labile enterotoxins. <i>E. coli</i> heat-labile enterotoxins (LT) are classified into two distinct serogroups (LT-I and LT-II) (reviewed in references <a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a> and <a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). CT is closely related to LT-I. Type I and type II LT have highly homologous A1 polypeptides and moderately homologous A2 polypeptides, but the B polypeptides of LT-II exhibit very low homology to CT or LT-I.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The A1 polypeptide of CT also has limited regions of homology with other ADP-ribosylating toxins (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>), including pertussis toxin (PT), diphtheria toxin (DT), and exotoxin A (ET-A). The three-dimensional structures of these toxins have been determined (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>, <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B40"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B40 B41 B42"">40-42</a>, <a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). All of these ADP-ribosylating toxins have NAD-binding domains with conserved features, but the overall structures of these toxins are not conserved.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Biochemical and genetic analyses of these ADP-ribosylating toxins, and CT and LT in particular, identified several positions where amino acid changes caused inactivation of toxicity (for a review see reference<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). In this study we systematically analyzed the functional importance of selected residues in CT-A that are fully conserved in all members of the <i>V. cholerae</i>-<i>E. coli</i> heat-labile enterotoxin family. Following site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned <i>ctxA</i> gene in <i>E. coli</i> we produced and characterized variant holotoxins with defined amino acid substitutions in CT-A. We identified variants of CT-A that retained the ability to assemble with CT-B to form holotoxins, but they exhibited decreased toxicity or no toxicity. Preliminary data were presented at several meetings, most recently at the 9th European Workshop on Bacterial Protein Toxins (Ste. Maxime, France, 27 June to 2 July 1999). This report emphasizes our findings with novel substitutions in CT that have not been reported previously in any variant of LT-I or LT-II. It also summarizes our comparative studies of substitutions in CT that significantly extend reported findings from previous studies on variants of LT-I or LT-II.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Conservative substitutions for Arg-7 (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>), Glu-110, and Glu-112 (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>) have previously been studied in LT but not biochemically in CT holotoxin, although R7K and E112K variant CT holotoxins have been tested for mucosal adjuvanticity (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). Tyr substitutions for Ser-68 and Val-72 were designed to substitute residues found at the corresponding position in PT where Tyr residues at the homologous positions are predicted to be involved in NAD binding, possibly contributing to the 1,000-fold lower<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> value for NAD of PT (cited in reference<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). In LT, different nonconservative substitutions for Ser-68 or Ala-72 were reported to prevent assembly (S68P) or to have no effect on toxicity (S68K or A72R, -H, or -E) (<a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38"">38</a>), although the A72R variant was later reported to show reduced toxicity (<a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>). Homologs of Asp-9 and Arg-11 are also fully conserved and important in PT (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), but substitutions at these positions have not been studied previously in either CT or LT. The hydrophobic Ile residue conserved at position 16 in CT and LT (Val-14 in LT-IIa and LT-IIb), predicted to interact with the nicotinamide moiety of NAD (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>), was changed to Ala (nonconservative) or Val (conservative). The CÎ± backbone trace homolog for Arg-25 in PT is Trp-26, which is also involved in catalysis (<a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>); therefore we converted Arg-25 to Trp or Gly to study the contribution of this residue in CT. Substitutions for Ile-16 and Arg-25 are entirely novel. Glu-29 is fully conserved in the CT-LT family. Although a deletion of this residue in CT has been shown to have greatly reduced toxicity and enzymatic activity (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>) for unknown reasons, substitutions for Glu-29 have not been studied previously. His-44, situated in an alpha helix and forming part of a loop that blocks the predicted active site, is also fully conserved among the heat-labile enterotoxins and is located similarly to His-35 of PT (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). His-44 is important in the activity of LT (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), and several nonconservative substitutions in the loop in LT were reported to be less active than that in the wild type (wt) (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). Here we made novel substitutions of Tyr and Ser for His-44 and also deleted the entire loop from 41 to 56 in CT. Four other insertion mutations were also introduced by addition of two-codon linkers (at Y30 and G34) or filling in of restriction sites at T48 (and L153, not shown in Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>). These studies confirmed and significantly extended previous investigations of the structure and function of CT.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3 data-style-of=""h4"">Analysis of CT variants.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Initial characterization of each variant holotoxin was performed on crude periplasmic extracts prepared from cells grown at 37Â°C. While most mutant strains produced wt levels of holotoxin, several mutant strains produced little or no detectable holotoxin under these conditions (R7K, H44Y, H44S, Î41-56+G, W127S, and L153LL). However, when the growth and induction temperature was reduced to 25 or 30Â°C, these mutant strains produced normal amounts of holotoxin (data not shown), and the holotoxin variants produced at 25 or 30Â°C were as stable as wt CT during subsequent incubations at 37Â°C, as determined by ELISA and SPRIA for immunoreactive holotoxin and Y1 adrenal cell assays for toxicity. Table<a href=""#T1"">1</a> summarizes the comparative data on holotoxin assembly, toxicity, and enzymatic activity for selected variant CT holotoxins. All holotoxins except the V72Y variant and the conservative substitution variants D9E, I16L, and E29D (not shown) had reduced toxicity, ranging from 50% (E29N, not shown) to less than 1% of the toxicity of wt toxin (R7K, R11K, H44Y, H44S, and E110D+E112D).<div class=""figure-wrap"">

Samples of these variant holotoxin preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and stained with Coommassie blue (data not shown). Each recombinant holotoxin produced in <i>E. coli</i> was fully stable during assays at 37Â°C with the CT-A protein in an unnicked form.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3 data-style-of=""h4"">Stability of variant holotoxins upon treatment with trypsin.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Each variant holotoxin was tested for the ability of its A subunit to be processed by mild trypsin treatment into stable CT-A1 and CT-A2 polypeptides. Untreated or trypsin-treated samples were reduced, denatured, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig.<a href=""#F2"">2</a>). Most variants were as stable upon trypsin treatment as the wt and generated the expected CT-A1 polypeptide in comparable amounts. Generally, the stability upon trypsinization correlated well with the temperature sensitivity of assembly reported in Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>. The H44Y variant was highly sensitive to trypsin and was almost completely degraded. The R7K, H44S, and R11K variant holotoxins also showed increased sensitivity to trypsin degradation, to decreasing degrees, as shown in Fig.<a href=""#F3"">3</a>. Analyses by GM<sub>1</sub>-SPRIA showed that recombinant wt CT treated with trypsin retained its reactivity with anti-CT-A antibody, and the toxin concentrations in the trypsin-treated and untreated samples, as determined by the slope of the curves, were identical (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>A). The 10% increase in signal at saturation seen after trypsinization probably reflects slightly greater reactivity of the polyclonal antibody with native nicked toxin, the antigen used for immunization.<div class=""figure-wrap"">

<div role=""paragraph"">Reduction of a duplicate sample of the trypsin-treated wt toxin with dithiothreitol prior to analysis by GM<sub>1</sub>-SPRIA led to almost complete loss of the signal (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>A), presumably reflecting dissociation of the A1 polypeptide from the immobilized A2B5 complex and showing that the trypsin-treated wt sample was in a fully nicked yet stable state. In contrast, the recombinant R7K variant holotoxin lost more than 90% of the signal after brief treatment with trypsin alone (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>B) without reduction, suggesting that the R7K substitution caused an altered conformation of the A subunit, exposing one or more trypsin-sensitive sites.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The R11K variant holotoxin exhibited an intermediate phenotype, where the immunogenicity of a portion of the sample was stable upon trypsin treatment, but approximately 40% of the molecules were degraded (Fig.<a href=""#F3"">3</a>C), as determined from the plateau signal (free CT-B competes for GM<sub>1</sub> binding and reduces the maximum signal) and the slope of the curve (a direct measurement of the concentration of holotoxin). This suggests a slight folding defect in the R11K variant, causing some of the molecules to adopt a wt conformation and the rest to adopt an alternative conformation with exposed trypsin-sensitive sites. The H44S variant, when assayed by reducing SDS-PAGE in a time-limited trypsin treatment format, was nicked by trypsin at the same initial rate as wt CT, but further incubation led to almost complete degradation (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>D).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3 data-style-of=""h4"">Differences in immunoreactivity of representative variant holotoxins.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Altered reactivity with MAbs, like differences in susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage, can often reveal subtle differences in conformation of proteins. Among our collection of MAbs that react with conformational epitopes of CT are several that react only with holotoxin by SPRIA, some that react well with holotoxin (by GM<sub>1</sub>-SPRIA) but poorly with free denatured CT-A (by Western blot), and, conversely, some that react poorly with holotoxin but well with free CT-A (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>). When we analyzed the temperature- or trypsin-sensitive variant holotoxins, we consistently found that they had altered patterns of reactivity towards these different classes of MAbs (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4</a>and Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>). Whereas the R11K variant had a slight assembly defect as determined by trypsin sensitivity, it behaved like wt CT in its reactivity with these MAbs, reacting well with 42C8 and 4G10, weakly with 40D3, and poorly with 37G7 and 34C11 (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4</a>A versus B). In contrast, the R7K variant had a completely different profile, retaining reactivity with 42C8 while losing reactivity to 4G10 and reacting much more strongly with the MAbs that normally give a poor signal with native CT (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4</a>C). Data for other variants are presented in Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>, representing the maximum signal obtained for each MAb (0.5 Î¼l of hybridoma supernatant per well). Deletion of the entire loop filling the active site (Î41-56+G variant) caused almost complete loss of reactivity with group 1 and 2 MAbs that react with holotoxin, suggesting that this loop determines or is essential for the epitope(s) detected by these MAbs. Each variant holotoxin that showed decreased reactivity with group 1 and 2 MAbs also gained reactivity with group 7B MAbs that normally react only with denatured CT-A (bound to plastic or nitrocellulose), suggesting a conformational change resulting in exposure of an epitope of CT-A that is normally hidden in wt holotoxin.<div class=""figure-wrap"">

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">By concentrating on residues that are highly conserved in the A subunits of the CT-LT family of enterotoxins, we identified several novel residues of CT-A that are critical to the structure and function of CT holotoxin. Novel substitution or insertion mutants for E29, Y30, E110, or E112 differentially affected toxicity and enzymatic activity in vitro without detectably affecting holotoxin structure, while the effects of other substitution mutants could be accounted for, at least in part, by previously undocumented alterations in holotoxin structure.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Many of these substitutions are located in or adjacent to the proposed active-site NAD-binding cleft (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>) and can reasonably be assumed to exert their effects directly on NAD binding (R7K, R11K, I16A) or catalytic activity (H44S, E110D, E112D). Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of members of the CT-LT family predicts that the residues equivalent to Glu-112 in CT correspond to the single active-site glutamates of PT (Glu-129), DT (Glu-148), and ET-A (Glu-153). In studies with an isolated LT-A subunit, however, both Glu-110 and Glu-112 were required for full enzymatic activity (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>, <a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>), since individual aspartate substitutions at these positions reduced activity 20- and 100-fold, respectively. We saw very similar results on toxicity with the individual aspartate-substituted mutant CT holotoxins but saw much greater effects on enzymatic activity. Only when both glutamates were replaced with aspartate did we see complete loss of toxicity and enzymatic activity. Clearly the members of the CT-LT family of ADP-ribosylating toxins differ significantly from the other ADP-ribosylating toxins in the details of their catalytic activity.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In crystallographic studies, the R7K variant of LT differed significantly in structure from wt LT (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>) and was more sensitive to proteolysis (<a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>). Our biochemical and immunological data showed similar changes in the R7K mutant of CT, supporting a role for R7K both in maintaining holotoxin structure and in NAD binding. The novel R11K variant was significantly more stable than the R7K variant, yet it showed a similar reduction in toxicity as well as an increased apparent <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> for NAD. The conservative R11K substitution had a much greater effect on toxin activity (&lt;1% of wt) than did a nonconservative substitution of the corresponding residue in PT (R13L) which showed 25% of wt toxicity (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>), emphasizing the differences in functional importance of conserved residues between these toxins. At the equivalent of position 16 in CT, PT and the LT-IIb toxin have Val, whereas CT, LT-I, and LT-IIa have Ile. Replacing Ile-16 with Ala in CT reduced activity 20- to 25-fold compared to that of the wt and significantly increased the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> for NAD, while the conservative Leu substitution had no effect, providing the first direct evidence for the importance of a highly hydrophobic residue at this position for NAD binding. These data provide novel, direct experimental support for the structure-based hypothesis of van den Akker et al. (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>, <a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>) that Ile-16 in LT (and, by inference, in CT) is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the adenine ring of NAD.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">We also changed the amino acids at positions 25, 68, and 72 in CT to residues found at homologous positions in PT that were proposed to participate in NAD binding (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>) to test the hypothesis that the poor affinity of CT for NAD (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> of several millimolars [<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>]) could be improved by modifying its predicted NAD-binding site to resemble more closely that of PT, which has a several-micromolar <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> for NAD (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>). In both CT and LT-I, Arg-25 has hydrophobic interactions with residue 55 that are proposed to influence the movement of the active-site-occluding loop 47 to 56 (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). The R25W variant, which may maintain some of these hydrophobic interactions with His-55, retained significantly greater enzymatic activity and toxicity than the R25G variant, although both were less active than the wt. The single substitutions S68Y and V72Y decreased the toxicity and enzymatic activity of the variant holotoxins slightly to moderately, but together they produced 20- and 30-fold reductions, respectively. The S68Y variant, in the presence of recombinant ARF6, showed a slight increase in the apparent<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> for NAD and a 10-fold reduction in the apparent <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> compared to those of the wt. These substitutions at positions 25, 68, and 72 in CT therefore generally had adverse effects on enzymatic activity and/or toxicity but not on the structure of the CT variants, and their phenotypes did not suggest that they had significantly increased affinity for NAD. Other investigators (<a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>) showed that CT-A1 variants with substitutions in the conserved Î²3 strand (YVSTS, residues 59 to 63) of the putative NAD-binding site (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>) also affected the structure of the variant CT-A1 polypeptides and markedly decreased their enzymatic activity, but they did not study the effects of these substitutions in variant holotoxins.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Data from our laboratory and others support the critical role played by the active-site-occluding loop in the activity of the heat-labile enterotoxins (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>, <a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). Substitutions for His-44 in CT decreased the stability of variant holotoxins and abolished enzyme activity in a manner similar to that reported for the H44A variant of LT (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>).

(<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>) that His-44 interacts directly with the catalytic residue Glu-112 is unlikely given the distance between His-44 and Glu-112 in the crystal structures of both LT and CT. Instead, His-44 may act indirectly to activate a water nucleophile that interacts with Glu-112, as proposed by Rising and Schramm (<a href=""#B39"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B39"">39</a>). In LT, substitutions within the active-site-occluding loop of residues that are found in the related LT-II toxins also affect structure and function (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>). The fact that normally cryptic epitopes recognized by our group 7B MAbs were exposed in the His-44 holotoxin variants, in the Î41-56 deletion variant, and in all temperature-sensitive holotoxin variants with significantly reduced activity (R7K, L153LL) suggests a common structural or folding defect in these variants. We see a slight effect on enzymatic activity and toxicity with a single residue insertion on the external surface of this loop in CT (T48TH). In a recent study, we independently identified an H44Y variant that affected the interaction of CT-A1 with ARF6 in a bacterial two-hybrid system (<a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">21</a>). All other substitutions in the present study with detectable enzymatic activity were stimulated by ARF6, suggesting that ARF6 does not interact directly with the catalytically important residues.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Surprisingly, substitutions for Glu-29 and Tyr-30 and the replacement of L153 by LL, which are all well removed from the proposed active site, significantly affected toxicity and enzymatic activity. The Y30WAH and E29H variant holotoxins retained high levels of enzymatic activity yet had 5- to 10-fold lower toxicity, respectively, suggesting an additional role for these residues in vivo, possibly for toxin entry, trafficking, or substrate interaction. An explanation for the phenotypes of the two other variants produced in this study, W127S and L153LL, is more difficult. Both showed temperature-sensitive assembly defects. Although the W127S holotoxin formed at the permissive temperature and appeared near-wt in its reactivity with anti-CT MAbs, it showed only 10% toxicity. The L153LL variant holotoxin behaved like the other structurally altered variants, displaying nonnative MAb epitopes and greatly reduced toxicity. This residue is well removed from the active site on the âbacksideâ of the A1 subunit. The L153LL insertion variant may exert its effects on toxin assembly by affecting interaction of the A1 polypeptide with the A2 subunit, but it is not clear how it dramatically affects the enzymatic and toxic activities of CT.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, we have identified a diverse group of novel holotoxins with variant CT-A subunits that have altered biological properties, which in some cases include greatly reduced toxicity. The present study significantly extends the available information on the effects of structural changes in CT-A on the biological and enzymatic activities of CT. Several of the CT variants that exhibited differential effects on toxicity and enzyme activity should be useful for future studies on the structural basis for interaction of CT with target cells. One or more of these variants may prove useful as an immunological adjuvant. In this regard, our collaborators recently showed that the E29H variant can act as an effective mucosal adjuvant for immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>).</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

Activation of the <i>tor</i> operon occurs upon binding of the phosphorylated response regulator TorR to a single operator site containing the direct repeat nucleotide sequence TTCATAN<sub>4</sub>TTCATA. Here we show that the replacement of any nucleotide of one TTCATA hexamer prevented TorR binding in vitro, meaning that TorR specifically interacts with this DNA target. Identical direct repeat sequences were found in the promoter regions of <i>torR</i> and of the new gene <i>torF</i> (<i>SO4694</i>), and they allowed TorR binding to both promoters. Real-time PCR experiments revealed that <i>torR</i> is negatively autoregulated, whereas <i>torF</i> is strongly induced by TorR in response to TMAO. Transcription start site location and footprinting analysis indicate that the operator site at <i>torR</i> overlaps the promoter â10 box, whereas the operator site at <i>torF</i> is centered at â74 bp from the start site, in agreement with the opposite role of TorR in the regulation of the two genes. Since <i>torF</i> and <i>torECAD</i> are positively coregulated by TorR, we propose that the TorF protein plays a role related to TMAO respiration.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<div role=""paragraph"">Trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) is a small compound mainly found in aquatic environments (<a href=""#R15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R15"">15</a>). In a number of marine animals including fish and crustaceans, it stabilizes proteins against the denaturing effect of stresses such as hydrostatic pressure or high urea or salt concentration (<a href=""#R20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R20"">20</a>, <a href=""#R31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R31"">31</a>, <a href=""#R32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R32"">32</a>). This protective role is not yet clearly established for bacteria, but many of them can use TMAO as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration (<a href=""#R3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R3"">3</a>, <a href=""#R28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R28"">28</a>). For example, <i>Shewanella</i> strains, which are gram-negative bacteria with wide respiratory capacities, can reduce TMAO efficiently to generate energy during fish spoilage (<a href=""#R13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R13"">13</a>, <a href=""#R14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R14"">14</a>, <a href=""#R16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R16"">16</a>). The main TMAO respiratory pathway of <i>Shewanella</i> species comprises a periplasmic terminal reductase (TorA) containing a molybdenum cofactor and a pentaheme <i>c</i>-type cytochrome (TorC) anchored to the inner membrane (<a href=""#R9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R9"">9</a>, <a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). The genes encoding the Tor pathway are clustered in the <i>torECAD</i> operon, and this operon is regulated by the TorS/TorR two-component system (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>). When TMAO is available in the medium, the sensor TorS transphosphorylates the response regulator TorR which, in turn, activates the <i>torECAD</i> operon by binding to a single operator site in the operon promoter (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A similar Tor respiratory system is present in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and its <i>torCAD</i> structural operon is also controlled by a TorS/TorR signal transduction system (<a href=""#R18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R18"">18</a>, <a href=""#R24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R24"">24</a>). The <i>E. coli</i> TorS sensor detects the presence of not only TMAO but also immature TorC to allow optimal production of the structural components of the Tor respiratory system in inducing conditions (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>, <a href=""#R19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R19"">19</a>). The physiological relevance of this subtle negative autoregulation by apocytochrome TorC is probably that TorC maturation is the limiting step of the Tor system biogenesis (<a href=""#R11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R11"">11</a>). Overproduction of the <i>c</i>-type cytochrome maturation machinery relieves the negative autoregulation by increasing the extent of TorC maturation (<a href=""#R1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R1"">1</a>). In addition to the <i>torCAD</i> operon, TorR-P activates the <i>tnaLAB</i> operon encoding the tryptophanase (TnaA) and a low-affinity tryptophan permease (TnaB). The physiological reason for the coregulation of <i>torCAD</i> and <i>tnaLAB</i> is that the tryptophanase activity protects <i>E. coli</i> against the alkaline stress generated by the production of alkaline TMA during TMAO respiration (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>). Indeed, TnaA reverses alkalinization by producing acidic products from <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-tryptophan.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In this study, we show that TorR of <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> activates <i>torECAD</i> and a new gene called <i>torF</i> (<i>SO4694</i>) and represses its own gene by binding to specific operator sites containing a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide sequence TTCATA separated by four nucleotides. <i>torF</i> encodes a protein that belongs to a new family of proteins of unknown function, and its coregulation with <i>torECAD</i> suggests that the TorF protein plays a key role in the TMAO respiratory system.</div>

<section id=""sec-1-1""><h3>Strains, media, and growth conditions.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">All strains of <i>S. oneidensis</i> used in this study are derivatives of strain MR1-R (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>, <a href=""#R26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R26"">26</a>). Strains SOR-3 and SOS-2 are, respectively, <i>torR</i> and <i>torS</i> insertion mutants. <i>S. oneidensis</i> was grown at 30Â°C in Luria-Bertani rich medium, complemented with 40 mM <span data-style=""small-caps"">l</span>-lactate and 20 mM HEPES as described by Myers and Myers (<a href=""#R27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R27"">27</a>). <i>E. coli</i> strains MC4100 and LCB436 [MC4100 but Î(<i>torSTRCAD</i>)] were grown at 37Â°C in Luria-Bertani medium (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). To maintain plasmid selection in <i>E. coli</i>, ampicillin was added at a concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-2""><h3>DNA manipulations.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">DNA preparation, restriction endonuclease digestion, purification, and ligation were carried out according to standard procedures. The transformation of <i>E. coli</i> was performed as described by Chung and Miller (<a href=""#R8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R8"">8</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-1-3""><h3>Plasmid constructions.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To create plasmid pPTorR<sub>SO</sub>, we performed PCR by using <i>S. oneidensis</i> chromosomal DNA as a template and the primer pair pR1-pR2 (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>) to generate a DNA fragment extending from â182 to + 19 (nucleotide position relative to the translation start site of <i>torR</i>). The PCR product was cloned into the SmaI site of pGE593 (<a href=""#R10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R10"">10</a>), and the resulting plasmid (pPTorR<sub>SO</sub>) was introduced into strain LCB436. The appropriate cloning orientation was determined by PCR. The absence of mutation in the cloned fragment was checked by DNA sequencing.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-4""><h3>RNA preparation.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">RNA was prepared by using a High Pure RNA isolation kit from Roche Diagnostics according to the manufacturer's instructions but with the slight modification that the DNase I digestion step was carried out twice in order to diminish the quantity of contaminating DNA. When the RNA was prepared in order to perform real-time PCR experiments, an additional third step of DNase I treatment was carried out in solution with RNase-free DNase I (Amersham) between the two passages through columns.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-5""><h3>Primer extension analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The transcription start sites of the <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> genes were determined in <i>E. coli</i> strain LCB436 carrying plasmid pPTorR<sub>SO</sub> and in <i>S. oneidensis</i> strain MR1-R, respectively. The strains were grown anaerobically in the presence of 50 mM TMAO until the culture reached an <i>A</i> <sub>600</sub> of 0.5. Total RNA was then extracted. The oligonucleotides used as probes were end labeled with [Î³-<sup>33</sup>P]ATP (2,500 Ci/mmol) by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Gibco-BRL) and purified with a QIAGEN QIAquick nucleotide removal kit. The primer extension reactions were performed with reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Gibco-BRL). The sequencing ladders were generated with the same oligonucleotides used for the primer extensions.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-6""><h3>RT PCR analysis.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) was performed with the Promega Access system. The oligonucleotides used are indicated in Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a> (see also Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). One microgram of purified RNA was denatured at 94Â°C for 2 min in the presence of the primers. Immediately afterwards, reverse transcription and 35 cycles of PCR amplification were carried out according to the supplier's protocol.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-7""><h3>Real-time PCR.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The relative abundance of the <i>torC</i>, <i>torR</i>, and <i>torF</i> transcripts of various <i>S. oneidensis</i> strains (MR1-R, SOR-3, and SOS-2) grown with or without TMAO (50 mM) was determined by real-time PCR. 16S rRNA was used as a reference standard. Real-time PCR was performed by using a LightCycler instrument and the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA, extracted from <i>S. oneidensis</i> strains grown with or without TMAO (50 mM), was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers. cDNA (2 ng) was then mixed with 4 mM MgCl<sub>2,</sub> a 0.1 Î¼M concentration of each primer, and 2 Î¼l of master mix in a 20-Î¼l final volume. The primer pairs used to quantify the <i>torC</i>, <i>torR</i>, <i>torF</i>, and 16S rRNA gene expression levels were C1-C2, R1-R2, F1-F2, and 16S1-16S2, respectively (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>). PCR assay was carried out with one cycle at 95Â°C for 8 min, followed by up to 45 cycles at 95Â°C for 15 sec, 60Â°C for 10 sec, and 72Â°C for 10 sec. The fluorescence derived from the incorporation of SYBR Green I into the double-stranded PCR products was measured at the end of each cycle to determine the amplification kinetics of each product. The fit points method described by the manufacturer was then applied to the results. Briefly, a horizontal noise band was determined as well as a log line fitting the exponential portion of the amplification curve. The intersections of these log lines with the horizontal noise line identified the crossing points. These crossing points were determined for each gene in both growth conditions. The induction factor was calculated as follows: 2<sup>(crossing point in absence of TMAO â crossing point in presence of TMAO)</sup>. The values were normalized by using values obtained with 16S rRNA. The real-time PCR experiments were performed three times with RNA samples prepared from independent cultures.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-8""><h3>Preparation of the TorR protein of <i>S. oneidensis</i>.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overproduction of the TorR protein of <i>S. oneidensis</i> was achieved by growing 100 ml of strain MC4100 carrying plasmid pR<sub>so</sub>1 (pBAD24 carrying the <i>torR</i> gene under the control of the arabinose-inducible promoter) (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). When the culture reached an <i>A</i> <sub>600</sub> of 1, overproduction of the TorR protein was induced for 1 h with 0.2% arabinose. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The cells were passed through a French press, and the extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was directly loaded on a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were eluted with a step gradient of KCl from 100 mM to 1 M. TorR was purified near to homogeneity in the 400 mM KCl fraction.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-9""><h3>Gel retardation assays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The DNA fragments were generated by PCR with the appropriate labeled and unlabeled primers. Labeling was carried out by using [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (4,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Gibco-BRL), and the labeled fragments were then separated from unincorporated nucleotides (QIAquick nucleotide removal kit; QIAGEN). Binding of TorR to labeled DNA fragments was carried out in a 4-Î¼l reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1.25 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.025% bromophenol blue, and 0.25 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC) per Î¼l. After 30 min at room temperature, the samples were loaded and run on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Pharmacia Phast System). The gel was exposed for 3 h at room temperature on a phosphorimager screen.</div></section><section id=""sec-1-10""><h3>DNase I footprinting.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The same labeled DNA fragments as those used for the gel retardation assays, encompassing the <i>torR</i> (201 bp) or the <i>torF</i> (386 bp) regulatory regions, were generated by PCR from plasmid pPTorR<sub>SO</sub> and from MR1-R chromosomal DNA, respectively, with the appropriate labeled and unlabeled primers. The footprinting experiments were performed as follows. About 1 nM of probe was used in 50 Î¼l of binding mix [10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 30 ng of poly(dI-dC) per Î¼l]. Different amounts of the purified TorR protein were then added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, DNase I was added (1 U; Promega), and the reaction was conducted for 1 min and then stopped by the addition of 140 Î¼l of DNase stop solution (192 mM sodium acetate, 32 mM EDTA, 0.14% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 64 Î¼g of yeast RNA per ml). After phenol-chloroform extraction and DNA-ethanol precipitation, the pellets were resuspended in loading solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide-8 M urea electrophoresis gel. The location of the protected nucleotides was deduced by running a ladder with the products of the G+A cleavage reaction.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-2""><h2>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>TorR binds to a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide sequence TTCATA in the <i>torECAD</i> promoter.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We have previously shown that TorR, the TMAO response regulator of <i>S. oneidensis</i>, induces the <i>torECAD</i> operon by binding to a single operator site located between positions â84 and â60 relative to the transcription start site (<a href=""#R12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R12"">12</a>). Inspection of this region revealed the presence of a direct repeat of the hexameric sequence TTCATA (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>). This tandem direct repeat could be the target of TorR because members of the OmpR family usually interact with direct repeats (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R21"">21</a>, <a href=""#R22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R22"">22</a>, <a href=""#R25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R25"">25</a>). To test this hypothesis, we first changed the center of each hexamer (italicized) independently by a double mutation (TT<i>CA</i>TAâTT<i>GC</i>TA) and carried out a DNA-binding gel shift assay with labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the <i>tor</i> operon region from position â90 to + 119 and purified TorR. As shown in Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>, the DNA fragments containing the double mutation (mutations 1 and 2) were not retarded by a high concentration (1 Î¼M) of TorR, whereas the wild-type fragment was. This preliminary result is consistent with the idea that each hexamer plays a key role in TorR binding. To study further the involvement of the TTCATA hexameric sequence in TorR binding, we replaced each nucleotide of the first hexamer with a guanine residue (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>). Strikingly, no retardation was observed for any of the six mutated fragments (mutations 3 to 8), meaning that each nucleotide of the first hexamer is essential for TorR binding. To confirm that the two hexamers play a similar role in TorR binding, we replaced one nucleotide of the second hexamer with a guanine residue. As expected, the mutated DNA fragment (mutation 10) was no longer retarded by TorR. In contrast, a point mutation TâG in the four-nucleotide region spacing the tandem repeats did not significantly affect TorR binding (Fig. <a href=""#F1"">1</a>, mutation 9). The same results were obtained when TorR was preincubated with acetyl phosphate (data not shown). Together, these results strongly suggest that the DNA recognition site of TorR comprises at least the sequence TTCATAN<sub>4</sub>TTCATA, and we propose that like other members of the OmpR family, phosphorylated TorR binds as a dimer to its operator site, with each monomer interacting with one direct repeat (<a href=""#R5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R5"">5</a>, <a href=""#R29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R29"">29</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-2""><h3>Binding of TorR to new promoters.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The fact that we knew the specific nucleotide sequence recognized by TorR in the <i>torECAD</i> promoter prompted us to look for homologous nucleotide sequences within the genome of <i>S. oneidensis</i> in order to find new potential targets of TorR. By using the bioMotif utility (<a href=""http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/doc/bioMotif/"">http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/doc/bioMotif/</a> ), we retrieved sequences homologous to the consensus sequence TTCATAN<sub>4</sub>TTCATA, located in noncoding regions or in the beginning of coding regions. This survey revealed two additional sequences identical to the consensus and located upstream of the coding sequences of <i>torR</i> and of <i>SO4694</i> (hereafter called <i>torF</i>) and one sequence upstream of <i>SO0949</i> containing a single change in one hexamer (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2A</a>). Since these sequences could be TorR binding sites, we checked whether the TorR protein was able to bind to them in vitro. Using a band shift assay, we observed DNA retardation for the promoter DNA of <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> but not for that of <i>SO0949</i> (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2B</a>). This result shows that TorR binds to the <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> promoters, and it confirms that only one base change in one of the TTCATA repeat sequences prevents TorR binding. The same pattern of retardation was observed when TorR was preincubated with 100 mM acetyl phosphate, but the TorR affinity for the <i>torE</i>, <i>torR</i>, and <i>torF</i> promoter DNA was increased two- to threefold, indicating that phosphorylation of TorR increased its affinity for the DNA targets containing the consensus motif (data not shown).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">The same pattern search approach was performed by using a five-nucleotide spacer between the two hexamers (consensus sequence, TTCATAN<sub>5</sub>TTCATA). Indeed, an additional nucleotide in the spacer modifies the distance between the nucleotide motif of the hexamers from 10 to 11 bp, meaning that the same motifs are still present on the same side of the DNA helix and, thus, might still allow TorR binding. However, no sequence entirely matching the consensus was found within the <i>S. oneidensis</i> genome, and, out of the seven sequences containing a single base change in one hexamer, none allowed TorR binding in vitro (data not shown). These results support the idea that TorR recognizes highly specific sequences present at only a restricted number of sites on the chromosome of <i>S. oneidensis</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">To check that TorR binds to the consensus sequence TTCATAN<sub>4</sub>TTCATA in the <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> promoters, we carried out a DNase I footprinting analysis with the DNA fragments used for the retardation experiments. As shown in Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2C</a>, in both cases a single region was protected against DNase I digestion when TorR was present. The protected regions extend over 25 to 27 nucleotides, and they cover the entire direct repeat sequences of the <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> promoters. This finding confirms that TorR recognizes operator sites containing a TTCATA repeat and suggests that it controls <i>torR</i> and <i>torF</i> gene expression.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>Negative autoregulation of the <i>torR</i> gene.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We tried to define the transcription start site of <i>torR</i> by primer extension experiments with RNA prepared from <i>S. oneidensis</i> MR1-R cells grown anaerobically with or without TMAO. These experiments were unsuccessful, probably because the amount of <i>torR</i> messenger was too low. To solve this problem, we fused the putative promoter region of <i>torR</i> to the promoterless <i>lacZ</i> gene of plasmid pGE593, and we introduced the resulting multicopy plasmid (pPTorR<sub>so</sub>) into an <i>E. coli</i> strain (LCB436) from which the entire <i>tor</i> locus was deleted to avoid any interference. We then carried out primer extension by using RNA prepared from the plasmid-containing <i>E. coli</i> cells and a primer hybridizing to the 5â² end of <i>lacZ</i> (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3B</a>). A transcription start site was located 23 bases upstream of the <i>torR</i> start codon. To confirm that the transcription start site of <i>torR</i> was identical in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. oneidensis</i>, we performed RT PCR by using RNA extracted from strain MR1-R and appropriate convergent oligonucleotide pairs (Fig. <a href=""#F3"">3</a>). When the upstream primer (R7) that hybridizes to the 5â² end of the potential <i>torR</i> messenger was used, a PCR product of the expected size was observed, but when an upstream primer (R8) complementary to the sequence just upstream of the putative transcription start site was used, no DNA fragment was amplified. The RT PCR experiment thus shows that the position of the <i>torR</i> transcription start site in <i>S. oneidensis</i> is identical or close to that defined by primer extension in <i>E. coli</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">A â10 promoter box (AATAAT) close to the <i>E. coli</i> â10 consensus sequence is correctly positioned relative to the start site, but the putative â35 box (TATGCA) is far from the <i>E. coli</i> â35 consensus box (TTGACA), supporting the idea that the <i>torR</i> promoter is weakly expressed in <i>S. oneidensis</i>. Moreover, one hexamer of the TorR operator site overlaps the â10 box, and, as a result, the TorR binding region which extends from position â3 to position â29 covers the â10 box (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2</a>). Interaction of TorR with the <i>torR</i> promoter might thus hamper the correct binding of the RNA polymerase to this promoter, and, consequently, TorR might repress expression of its own gene. To test a possible negative autoregulation of the <i>torR</i> gene, we performed real-time PCR from total RNA extracted from MR1-R cells grown anaerobically with or without TMAO. The cDNA samples were synthesized by using random hexamers as primers, and the real-time PCR was carried out by using a <i>torR</i> specific primer pair (Table <a href=""#T1"">1</a>, R1-R2). Real-time PCR was also performed with a 16S-specific primer pair (16S1-16S2) to quantify the amount of 16S RNA in each sample, and the relative level of <i>torR</i> transcript was then normalized to that of the 16S RNA. As shown in Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>, the amount of <i>torR</i> transcript decreased almost threefold when the cells were grown in the presence of TMAO, meaning that the expression of <i>torR</i> is negatively autoregulated, as expected from the in vitro experiments (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2</a>). Unfortunately, the control experiment with RNA extracted from the <i>torR</i> strain (SOR-3) was not feasible because the mutation in this strain corresponds to an ISSo2 insertion into the <i>torR</i> promoter region, leading to the absence of <i>torR</i> transcription (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>). However, the <i>torR</i> transcript levels were similar in the <i>torS</i> strain (SOS-2) grown with or without TMAO (induction increased by a factor of 1.3 Â± 0.3 [mean Â± standard deviation]), thus confirming that the <i>torR</i> gene is negatively regulated by phosphorylated TorR.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In <i>E. coli</i>, the <i>torR</i> gene is also negatively autoregulated, but this autoregulation occurs even in a <i>torS</i> strain or in the absence of TMAO (<a href=""#R2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R2"">2</a>). In fact, the <i>E. coli torR</i> gene is always repressed because phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated TorR binds to a high-affinity binding site overlapping the <i>torR</i> transcription start site (<a href=""#R30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R30"">30</a>). The situation is quite different in <i>S. oneidensis</i> since <i>torR</i> negative autoregulation occurs in the presence of TMAO and, thus, probably involves only the phosphorylated form of TorR. Consequently, TorR negative autoregulation maintains the TorR concentration at a low level whatever the growth conditions in <i>E. coli</i>, whereas in <i>S. oneidensis</i>, it decreases TorR production when TMAO is present in the medium. The reason for this subtle difference is unknown, but, in general, negative autoregulation has homeostatic properties and allows the production of a precise amount of regulator in the cell. Although more than one-third of the transcriptional factors are negatively autoregulated in <i>E. coli</i>, several response regulators proved to be positively autoregulated (<a href=""#R17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R17"">17</a>, <a href=""#R23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R23"">23</a>). One proposal to explain positive autoregulation is that an increased concentration of a given response regulator is required in inducing conditions when the regulator controls many genes and must, therefore, bind to many targets at the same time (<a href=""#R4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R4"">4</a>). The restricted number of targets for TorR of <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. oneidensis</i> might explain why TorR is negatively rather than positively autoregulated in both strains.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Activation of the gene <i>torF</i> (<i>SO4694</i>) by TorR.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The transcription start site of <i>torF</i> was defined by a primer extension experiment with RNA prepared from MR1-R cells grown anaerobically with TMAO (Fig. <a href=""#F4"">4</a>). A single start site was located 34 bases upstream of the <i>torF</i> initiation codon, and a â10 promoter box (TACGAT) was found correctly positioned relative to the start site. In contrast, no putative â35 box could be found 16 to 18 bp upstream of the â10 box, but the TorR binding site is centered 74 bp upstream of the start site at a position compatible with that of an activator binding site (Fig. <a href=""#F2"">2</a> and <a href=""#F4"">4</a>). To follow expression of <i>torF</i>, we carried out real-time PCR experiments from total RNA prepared from strains MR1-R and SOR-3 grown with or without TMAO. As shown in Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>, <i>torF</i> expression was strongly induced by TMAO in strain MR1-R since the amount of <i>torF</i> transcript increased &gt;60-fold when TMAO was added. In contrast, <i>torF</i> was poorly induced in strain SOR-3. These results clearly indicate that TorR is responsible for the strong induction of <i>torF</i> and confirm that TorR mediates TMAO signaling in <i>S. oneidensis</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">By using a plasmid-borne <i>torE</i>â²<i>-lacZ</i> fusion, we have previously shown that the Î²-galactosidase activities increased almost 40-fold in the presence of TMAO in the wild-type context, whereas no significant increase was observed in the <i>torR</i> strain SOR-3 (<a href=""#R6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R6"">6</a>). Although these data are consistent with a strong TMAO induction of the <i>torECAD</i> operon mediated by TorR, they were indirectly assessed from a multicopy plasmid. To confirm <i>tor</i> operon activation and to compare it with that of <i>torF</i>, we carried out real-time PCR with <i>torC</i>-specific primers (C1-C2) and the cDNA samples generated for the <i>torF</i> expression study. As shown in Table <a href=""#T2"">2</a>, the <i>torC</i> induction factor was &gt;20-fold in strain MR1-R, whereas it was close to 1 in strain SOR-3. The real-time PCR experiments thus confirm that the <i>torECAD</i> operon is activated by TorR, but the level of induction is somewhat lower for the <i>torECAD</i> operon than for the <i>torF</i> gene. This result was quite unexpected because the <i>torECAD</i> operon encodes the TMAO reductase respiratory complex and, thus, was supposed to be the main target of the TMAO response regulator TorR. In any case, the fact that <i>torF</i> is strongly induced by TorR suggests that the TorF protein plays a key role either in the TMAO respiratory system or in another TMAO-related pathway. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis has recently revealed that in <i>E. coli</i> the TorS/TorR phosphorelay system positively regulated the <i>tnaLAB</i> operon in addition to <i>torCAD</i>, but the TMAO induction factors, measured either from DNA arrays or from <i>lacZ</i> fusions, were clearly higher for <i>torCAD</i> than for <i>tnaLAB</i> (<a href=""#R7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""R7"">7</a>).</div></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>TorF belongs to a new family of proteins of unknown function.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The <i>torF</i> gene (<i>SO4694</i>) is a monocistronic unit encoding a putative protein of 245 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 26,998 Da. The amino acid sequence was compared with those of the proteins listed in the databases, and significant similarity was detected with several putative proteins encoded by various genomes of proteobacteria including <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> (Avin4116), <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> (BP1724), and <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> (CC2658). However, no protein homologous to TorF is encoded by the related genome of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> or by that of <i>E. coli</i>, and, in particular, no similarity was found with either TnaA or TnaB. Interestingly, one of the homologous proteins is encoded by a gene of <i>S. oneidensis</i> (<i>SO3502</i>), meaning that the <i>torF</i> gene might have been duplicated in this strain. So far, no biological function has been assigned to any of these homologues. These proteins could thus be classified in a new family of conserved proteins of unknown function.</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Concluding remarks.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The analysis of the DNA targets of the TMAO regulator TorR of <i>S. oneidensis</i> revealed that TorR recognizes highly specific operator sites containing a direct repeat of the sequence TTCATA. The TorR binding sites were only found in the promoters of <i>torECAD</i>, <i>torF</i>, and <i>torR</i>, and they allow TMAO induction of the <i>torECAD</i> and <i>torF</i> units and TMAO repression of the <i>torR</i> gene. Since the <i>torF</i> gene which encodes a protein of unknown function is coregulated with the <i>torECAD</i> operon encoding the TMAO respiratory system, we propose that TorF plays a specific role related to TMAO respiration. Future investigation will aim to define the function of TorF and of the other members of the TorF family.</div></section></section><div role=""paragraph"">

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00112-19","<div role=""paragraph"">Microbiomes contain many levels of biological information, and integrating across the levels creates a holistic understanding of host-microbiome interactions. In my research on the evolution and ecology of avian microbiomes, I use two complementary frameworks: the microbiome as a community and the microbiome as a trait of the host. We draw on classic ecological and evolutionary theory and modern statistical models to advance our understanding in each of these frameworks and then integrate what we have learned into a better understanding of host-associated microbiomes, host evolution, and microbial biodiversity. Ecological theories that bear on processes such as community assembly and metacommunities are well suited for application to microbiomes. Phylogenetic comparative methods can quantify the fit of evolutionary models and detect correlations between traits and correlations between traits and the rate of evolution; these methods allow the inference of evolutionary process from contemporary patterns.</div><section id=""bodymatter"" data-extent=""bodymatter"" property=""articleBody"" typeof=""Text""><div class=""core-container"">
<section id=""sec-1""><h2>PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">It is clear that the microbiome can influence host biology in myriad ways sufficient to affect host fitness. On the level of the individual host, the microbiome can tip the balance between health and disease, promote or deter proper development, and influence behavior. It is also clear that there is variation within populations in microbiome composition and function, i.e., an axis of individual variation that is exposed to natural selection. If the microbiome can influence the fitness of a host, then we can also ask how it has contributed to the evolutionary trajectory of populations, to the speciation or extinction of lineages, or to the diversification of host biology. These big questions cannot be answered experimentally and attest to the importance of wild organisms and descriptive science for understanding the role of the microbiome in evolutionary biology.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">My research is primarily interested in the ecology and evolution of the avian microbiome. Birds are a globally distributed class of vertebrates that encompass immense ecological and morphological diversity. This makes them an excellent comparative system in which to try to discover fundamental rules that shape interactions between hosts and their microbiomes. Their suite of adaptations, particularly feathers and powered flight, have impacted many aspects of avian biology, and the microbiome may be no exception. How have microbes and microbiomes influenced bird biology, including ecology and phylogeny? How have birds influenced the microbiome and its members? To answer these questions and fully understand the processes shaping host-associated microbiomes, we need an ecological understanding of the microbiome as a community of interacting individuals (the microbeâs perspective) and an evolutionary understanding of the microbiome as a trait of the host (the hostâs perspective).</div></section><section id=""sec-2""><h2>MICROBIOMES AS COMMUNITIES</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">All biodiversity organizes into and functions as members of communities (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). How community assembly and persistence are accomplished are fundamental issues in ecology that apply to macroorganisms and microorganisms alike. âNiche-basedâ community assembly states that organisms have ecological niches that dictate and assure their role in a community. An alternative view is that communities assemble in a neutral way or in a way that is agnostic to ecological niche. The debate concerning the theories of niche-based assembly and neutral assembly of communities is ongoing in the field of ecology, and I am interested in whether and how these theories are supported in avian microbiomes, particularly across body sites with differing properties and purposes. The scale of interrogation can have an impact on whether we discern neutral or niche-based patterns (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>), and, given the many hierarchical levels in host-associated microbiomes, the spatial and phylogenetic scales that we consider could matter greatly. Another consideration is intraspecific variability in microbiomes, which exists within the composition and function of microbiomes. Intraspecific variation, compared to interspecific variation, at a given scale may influence our inference of the processes structuring communities and should be quantified when possible (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a>).</div>
<div class=""figure-wrap"">
<header></header><figure id=""fig1"" class=""graphic""></figure>
</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Perhaps microbiomes support both niche-based and neutral components for their community assembly (see, e.g., reference <a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>). The âcompetitive lottery modelâ (<a href=""#B4"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B4"">4</a>) states that niches in a community can be filled only by organisms with particular functional traits and that any organism that has the trait and arrives first fills that niche. Functional redundancyâwhere exact species are interchangeable if they perform specific functionsâcan be a powerful and common force in microbial communities (reviewed in reference <a href=""#B5"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B5"">5</a>). Our application of community assembly theory may be greatly improved by considering such biological properties of microbes and microbiomes (reviewed in reference <a href=""#B6"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B6"">6</a>). If microbiome assembly is based on function rather than taxonomy, a method that describes taxonomy but not functional capability will not reflect community assembly processes and may positively mislead interpretations.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>In my laboratory.</b> We are gathering shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to better understand the assembly and stability of microbial function in avian microbiomes. We are also pursuing how diversity in these methods compares to the taxonomic diversity estimated using 16S rRNA surveys. To get a complete picture of the microbiome, we are in the nascent stages of incorporating the virome and eukaryotic microorganisms into our diversity estimates as well.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<b>In the near future.</b> A better understanding of microbial communities will come with improved methods for describing their fundamental biological units. We are hindered by a lack of an accepted microbial species concept, philosophically and practically. Unfortunately, it seems as if the more (sequence) data we have, the more elusive a definition for species becomes. The use of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to delimit âspeciesâ has been invaluable, but the use of any single marker has limitations. I believe that 16S rRNA surveys will continue to provide important data contributing to our understanding of microbiomes in novel systems. How we complement them to properly describe the functional (and taxonomic) diversity of communities using additional molecular methods is an exciting prospect that is or will soon be within reach for many laboratories as the cost of high-throughput sequencing continues to drop (per base). Databases of full-length 16S rRNA genes, of full-length genomes, and of annotated gene families will continue to grow as novel environments are investigated. Describing novel microbiomes is also important from a basic biodiversity perspective. Discovering the undiscovered requires investment in undescribed hosts or novel ecologies and may have far-reaching benefits, such as adding branches to the tree of life or discovering human life-saving drugs.</div></section><section id=""sec-3""><h2>MICROBIOMES AS A TRAIT OF THE HOST</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">The microbiome can be viewed as a trait of a host (<a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1</a>). Understanding the forces shaping trait distributions across species is a fundamental goal of organismal biology. Large-scale patterns in morphological, behavioral, ecological, or genomic traits can indicate the processes acting above the level of the individual and cannot be addressed in laboratory settings or by analyzing a single species. Importantly, many traits are not independent of phylogeny (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>), and phylogenetic comparative methods provide one way to account for phylogeny in the study of the distribution of traits among species. Thus, we can use these methods to infer what evolutionary processes have generated the microbiome and to better understand the role that microbiomes have played in host evolution.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">One specific use of phylogenetic comparative methods is to assess how well an evolutionary model fits the contemporary distribution of trait values. Given empirical trait values for a set of species and a phylogeny that unites them, we can first infer the state of the trait at all internal nodes of the tree, including the root. Brownian motion models are commonly used as the neutral expectation for how a trait will vary over a particular phylogeny. Information criteria then compare the neutral model against models that incorporate selection or models with no phylogenetic signal at all. In this application, we may discern whether selection need be invoked to explain a trait. A second use of phylogenetic comparative methods is to estimate the correlation between traits or how a trait relates to the environment. Here we may determine factors such as whether a particular host genetic variant is correlated to the microbiome. A third application is to evaluate a traitâs role in speciation and extinction rates. Many options now exist for such tests, including the popular binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) model (<a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>). Here we may ask whether the microbiome contributed to the rapid diversification (or relative stasis) of avian lineages. Interdisciplinary microbiome researchers should be aware of the extensive literature on the strengths and limitations of phylogenetic comparative methods (see, e.g., references <a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a>, <a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11"">11</a>, and <a href=""#B12"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B12"">12</a>) and the statistical assumptions of specific evolutionary models (see, e.g., reference <a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">One important consideration for any model evaluating the microbiome as a trait is identifying what properties of the microbiome contain information about the host and what properties represent a reflection of the environment or are stochastic. It is unclear how to best quantify microbiomes at the host-species level as a single value. How do we accurately summarize communities as complex as the microbiome? Comparative analyses require large sample sizes and well-estimated trees. Practically speaking, the most cost-effective way to generate microbiome data from hundreds of individuals is by 16S rRNA surveys. However, there are known weaknesses of 16S data that may make it undesirable for the purpose of phylogenetic comparative methods. Consider again functional redundancy or a competitive lottery model of community assemblyâthe taxa in a sample may not reflect the selection that is determining whether a microbe has a role in a microbiome. Function may be more important and more stable than taxon in microbiomes (<a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3"">3</a>, <a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>). Using current 16S rRNA methods (without also measuring absolute abundance), means data are strictly compositional, so how taxonomic groups compare in absolute terms across individuals cannot be determined (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2</a>).</div>

</div>
<section id=""sec-3-1""><h3>In my laboratory.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We are investigating how phylogenetic comparative methods perform using 16S data and assessing model fit across neutral models, models that incorporate selection, and models that contain no phylogenetic signal. We are coding the microbiome in terms of composition and diversity, under the null hypothesis that the microbiome contains phylogenetic signal. We are gathering data on the functional capabilities of microbiomes and will code them for phylogenetic comparative method analysis to compare to the models that fit the taxonomic (16S) data. Importantly, our analyses benefit greatly from the wealth of ornithological research on bird life histories, physiology, ecology, and behaviors. Avian microbiome science can also leverage the extensive avian genomics literature to both construct and test hypotheses about the relationships between birds and microbes. One exciting example of this is the OpenWings Project (<a href=""http://www.openwings.org/"">http://www.openwings.org/</a>)âan ongoing collaboration among 12 major ornithological collections that will gather genomic data (ultraconserved elements [UCEs]) from each of the 10,560 named bird species.</div></section><section id=""sec-3-2""><h3>In the near future.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbiome research is interdisciplinary and dependent on the foundational papers and cutting edge research in many fields. As our methods and findings become more sophisticated, I hope to see further integration between theory, phylogenetic methods and models, and community ecology in the context of host-associated microbiomes. We should utilize the wealth of information that has been published in recent decades in the fields of ecology and evolution, but there is also need for development of new models that incorporate microorganism-specific parameters, e.g., horizontal gene transfer. As microbiome research incorporates new markers in addition to 16S and as we find less expensive ways to mine the most meaningful data from microbiomes, it will become clearer how to code the microbiome for comparative analyses.</div></section></section><section id=""sec-4""><h2>INTEGRATION OF THE MICROBEâS PERSPECTIVE WITH THE HOSTâS PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Microbiomes are hierarchical, and the various layers of interaction may contain conflicting signals. Variation is a major outstanding issue for me, and we are currently collecting data to describe the taxonomic and functional diversity across the entire species range of an endangered saltmarsh specialist, the Saltmarsh Sparrow. Working with the Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program (SHARP), we have collected data from over 35 populations across the entire breeding range of the species. We will be able to estimate gamma diversity for the species and elucidate the geographic structure of the microbiome. This is also an important basic biodiversity project, as the Saltmarsh Sparrow is projected to be extinct by 2050 and describing their microbiome now, before substantive human intervention, will give us a baseline of their natural microbiome. Gamma diversity is unknown for many, if not most, hosts but could be important for understanding both the community ecology perspective as well as the host trait perspective. How much variation exists in the microbiome? This question could be especially important because as species interactions change in a changing environment, the role of functional redundancy can change as well (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>).</div></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00225-17","<div role=""paragraph"">The potential for microbes to overcome antibiotics of different classes before they reach bacterial cells is largely unexplored. Here we show that a soluble bacterial lipocalin produced by <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> upon exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations increases resistance to diverse antibiotics <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These phenotypes were recapitulated by heterologous expression in <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> of lipocalin genes from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Purified lipocalin bound different classes of bactericidal antibiotics and contributed to bacterial survival <i>in vivo</i>. Experimental and X-ray crystal structure-guided computational studies revealed that lipocalins counteract antibiotic action by capturing antibiotics in the extracellular space. We also demonstrated that fat-soluble vitamins prevent antibiotic capture by binding bacterial lipocalin with higher affinity than antibiotics. Therefore, bacterial lipocalins contribute to antimicrobial resistance by capturing diverse antibiotics in the extracellular space at the site of infection, which can be counteracted by known vitamins.</div>

<section id=""sec-1"" data-type=""intro""><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Treating infections is becoming increasingly difficult since microbes often show intrinsic high-level resistance to virtually all clinically approved antibiotics (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Ineffective microbial killing and exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations elicit adaptive bacterial stress responses, enhancing antibiotic resistance and tolerance (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3 B4 B5 B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Much has been learned about antibiotic resistance mechanisms at the cellular level (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), but whether microbes subvert the action of antibiotics before they come in contact with bacterial cells has remained largely unexplored, with the exception of Î²-lactamases, which are often trapped in released membrane vesicles (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11 B12"">â</a><a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), and the recent observation that <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> inactivates daptomycin by releasing membrane phospholipids (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> is a highly multidrug resistant, opportunistic, Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). Bacteria of the genus <i>Burkholderia</i> are notorious for their ability to resist the action of multiple classes of antimicrobials (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), representing an attractive model to understand intrinsic mechanisms of resistance in opportunistic bacteria. Recently, we showed that in response to sublethal antibiotic concentrations, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> produces and releases molecules such as the polyamine putrescine and YceI, a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). YceI proteins are a family of bacterial lipocalins (BCNs), which are small proteins widely conserved in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but whose physiological role is unclear (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). In coculture experiments, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> protects <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> from killing by different bactericidal antibiotics (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). This effect was abrogated in the <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> Î<i>bcnA-bcnB</i> double-deletion mutant (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>), but the individual contribution of each BCN paralog and its mechanism remained unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we show that secreted BcnA contributes to increased resistance of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> to various classes of antibiotics <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The expression of BCN orthologs from <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i>, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>S.Â aureus</i> in a <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant recapitulated this function. Experimental and computational studies revealed that BCNs bind to a range of antibiotics, thus preventing their antibacterial activity and contributing to resistance. X-ray crystallography studies of BCN structures, in combination with docking and MD simulations, have helped us to rationalize plausible binding modes. We also discovered that fat-soluble vitamins bound BcnA with a higher affinity than antibiotics, enabling them to outcompete antibiotics. This finding provides a clinically applicable strategy whereby known vitamins could become antibiotic adjuvants by increasing the concentration of free antibiotics in the proximity of bacterial cells, thereby boosting their microbicidal activity.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>BcnA is a secreted bacterial lipocalin required for full resistance of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> to different classes of antibiotics.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We investigated the role of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA (BCAL3311) and BcnB (BCAL3310) by constructing individual deletion mutants in their corresponding genes and assessing bacterial susceptibility to model bactericidal antibiotics representing different classes, including rifamycins (mRNA transcription inhibitors), fluoroquinolones (DNA replication inhibitors), several Î²-lactams (cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors), and cationic antimicrobial peptides (cell membrane active agents). The Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant, but not the Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant, had increased susceptibility (4-fold MIC reduction) to rifampin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B (PmB) and a 2-fold meropenem MIC reduction. No effect was observed with the aminoglycoside gentamicin (protein synthesis inhibitor) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>; see antibiotic chemical structures in <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Similarly, we also tested model bacteriostatic antibiotics representing different classes.

<div role=""paragraph"">The expression of the <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> genes in response to antibiotics at concentrations near the MIC (sublethal) was characterized by constructing chromosomal <i>lux</i> fusions. Expression of <i>bcnA</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> was upregulated upon exposure to PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). In contrast, <i>bcnA</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> expression in response to gentamicin remained unchanged (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). Expression of <i>bcnB</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> only increased upon exposure to norfloxacin and ceftazidime (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2A</a>). Thus, the <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> genes respond to antibiotic stress, but they appeared to be differentially regulated. <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> are located on the same strand 63Â bp apart (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). Immediately upstream of <i>bcnA</i>, there is an open reading frame (BCAL3312), also transcribed on the same strand, that encodes a predicted cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>651</sub> protein. Putative promoter regions are found upstream of BCAL3312 and downstream from <i>bcnB</i>, next to a predicted Rho-independent transcription termination sequence. The genomic organization of the <i>bcn</i> region suggests that BCAL3312, <i>bcnA</i>, and <i>bcnB</i> are cotranscribed and may form an operon. However, the transcribed 63-bp intergenic region between <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> has the potential to form strong RNA secondary structures, which might explain the differential regulation of the two genes by antibiotics. The secretion of the BcnA and BcnB proteins was also investigated by using FLAG-tagged derivatives; only BcnA was secreted extracellularly into the growth medium (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2B</a>). From these experiments, we concluded that BcnA is the major contributor to intrinsic antibiotic resistance upon antibiotic stress and is secreted into the extracellular bacterial milieu.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">To demonstrate whether BCN orthologs from other bacteria could restore BcnA function in the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant strain, we tested BCNs of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 [PA0423, PA4340, and PA4345, which are BcnA1(Pa), BcnA2(Pa), and BcnA3(Pa), respectively, here], <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv [Rv1890c, which is BcnA(MTb) here], and community-acquired methicillin-resistant <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 [SAUSA300_2620, which is BcnA(Sa) here]. CFU counts on PmB-containing plates (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a>) and E-test MICs of rifampin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone closely related to norfloxacin) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>) showed that heterologous expression of BCNs from these different bacteria restores antibiotic resistance to parental levels, indicating that these proteins have a conserved function.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>BcnA sequesters antibiotics.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">BCNs bind to diverse hydrophobic molecules (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">â</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>); hence, we hypothesized that BCNs could capture antibiotics and reduce their effective concentration in the bacterial milieu. An antibiotic bioassay demonstrated that BcnA sequestered rifampin, PmB, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime, in descending order of magnitude, but not gentamicin (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3A</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">E</a>). Further, the relative affinity of BcnA for antibiotics was determined <i>in vitro</i> by binding competition of antibiotics with Nile red in complex with BcnA. Nile red is a fluorophore used to test hydrophobic binding sites in proteins (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). The calculated binding inhibitory constants (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values) of the antibiotics (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3F</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">M</a>) mirrored their relative abilities to be sequestered by BcnA (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>) and the antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes of the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). Notably, the binding of BcnB to Nile red occurred with ~20-fold lower affinity than that of BcnA (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3N</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">Q</a>), agreeing with the lesser role of BcnB in antibiotic resistance. The involvement of hydrophobic moieties in the interaction of ligands with BcnA was suggested by the significantly higher <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> value of the PmB nonapeptide, which lacks the hydrophobic N-terminal tail of PmB (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), relative to that of PmB (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3F</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">I</a>). Notably, azithromycin and gentamicin, the only antibiotics not showing the antibiotic sensitivity reduction phenotype with the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>), are the only antibiotics tested that lack aromatic or hydrophobic moieties (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>). To test polar hydrophilic binding sites in BcnA compared to hydrophobic sites, we used two related BODIPY dye-labeled phospholipids. BcnA increased the intensity of fluorescence of the BODIPY fluorophore when attached to the fatty acyl chain of the phospholipid in BODIPY-phosphocholine but not when attached to the hydrophilic polar head group (BODIPY-phosphoethanolamine) (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3R</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">T</a>). This further supported a role for fatty acyl chains in the interaction with hydrophobic sites in BcnA.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Structure determination and molecular modeling reveal distinct docked binding modes for BcnA.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To elucidate the mode of binding of antibiotics within BCNs, we first solved the X-ray crystal structures of BcnA and BcnB to 1.4- and 1.6-Ã resolutions, respectively (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>, <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>, and <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4A</a> to <a href=""#figS4"">E</a>). Visual inspection and structural alignments by the DALI server (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>) confirmed a barrel-shaped lipocalin fold for both proteins (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a> and <a href=""#fig4"">B</a>). An octaprenyl pyrophosphate was bound within a long, hydrophobic tunnel extending from one end of the barrel in each structure (<a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4A</a> and <a href=""#figS4"">B</a>). The binding of octaprenyl pyrophosphate potentially occurred during recombinant expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Analysis with the PDBePISA server (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>) predicted that BcnA is a monomer, while BcnB is a dimer, by crystallographic symmetry (~2,840Â Ã<sup>2</sup> of buried surface area including a portion of the tunnel opening). These oligomeric states were confirmed in solution by size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4C</a> and <a href=""#figS4"">D</a>). Superposition of BcnA chain A and BcnB chain C (148 CÎ± atoms, 22% sequence identity) resulted in a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.66Â Ã (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). The largest structural differences observed were located in two of the loops that make up the tunnel opening (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). These differences may play a role in the antibiotic binding potential of BcnA and BcnB.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Using the established crystallographic structures, we applied molecular modeling and docking calculations to predict BCN binding modes of antibiotics (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>). These studies suggested two distinct docked binding modes for BcnA. One binding mode involved residues in the rim of the lipocalin pocket (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4F</a> to <a href=""#figS4"">I</a>). Polar interactions, mainly with polar residues, were observed with all of the antibiotics tested. There were also interactions between the aromatic moieties in PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime and lipophilic residues. These interactions were not observed with gentamicin, which lacks aromatic moieties and binds weakly to BcnA. The second binding mode was predicted for more lipophilic molecules (e.g., Nile red), occurring deeper inside the lipophilic tunnel (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). Further, analyses from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations suggested both structural and ligand recognition roles for residues D82 and D93 (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>). These residues are located in the loops at the top of the tunnel opening of BcnA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and the BcnA<sub>D82A-D93A</sub> mutant showed decreased binding affinity for Nile red (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5A</a> and <a href=""#figS5"">B</a>), which we propose is due to structural changes (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>; <a href=""#figS6"">Fig.Â S6A</a> to <a href=""#figS6"">E</a> and <a href=""#figS7"">S7</a>). Docking of Nile red into the BcnA<sub>D82A-D93A</sub> mutant (following the general docking protocol with the minimized average structure from ns 2.5 to ns 5 of the MD simulation) did not lead to any binding position inside the lipophilic tunnel (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7</a>). Interestingly, D93 is a highly conserved residue in the consensus motif of the BCN protein family (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5C</a>), exemplified in the alignment of BCN homologues (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5D</a>). Further, Asp is found in positions equivalent to D82 in homologues of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA. Thus, it is credible that the mode of interaction between BcnA and antibiotics is common among this large family of conserved bacterial proteins.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Since <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA is secreted (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2D</a>), as predicted for most other BCNs, we hypothesized that exogenous BCNs produced by one bacterial species have the potential to protect other bacteria from the action of antibiotics, including antimicrobial peptides. This was investigated by using purified recombinant BCNs from <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i>. <i>In vitro</i> antibiotic protection assays showed that <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 treated with 1.5Â ÂµM purified BcnA, but not BcnB, had reduced sensitivity to PmB (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In contrast, at 8- to 16-fold lower PmB concentrations, both proteins protected <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhi, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Acinetobacter lwoffii</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter junii</i> strains (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7A</a>). This disparity in the PmB concentrations at which protection by BcnA and BcnB occurs correlates with their relative affinities to Nile red (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3N</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">Q</a>; see above). <i>In vivo</i> infections of C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that BcnA protected <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> Q502, a virulent cystic fibrosis clinical isolate (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>), from PmB killing in an intraperitoneal (i.p.) sepsis model (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>). We also employed the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larval infection model. The Î<i>bcnA</i> and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutants had reduced virulence in <i>G.Â mellonella</i> relative to that of the parent strain (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7B</a>). However, significantly lower numbers of Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant bacteria than parental and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant strain bacteria were recovered from the hemolymph of infected larvae at 200Â min postinfection (<a href=""#figS6"">Fig.Â S6B</a>), suggesting that Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant bacteria were more susceptible than Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant bacteria to the larval humoral immune response, which is mainly driven by host antimicrobial peptides (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), mirroring the different <i>in vitro</i> susceptibilities of Î<i>bcnA</i> and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant bacteria to PmB. Similarly, infection of BcnA-treated <i>G.Â mellonella</i> larvae with <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 resulted in more rapid killing of the larvae than control or BcnB-treated larvae (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). We recovered significantly higher numbers of bacterial CFU from the hemolymph of BcnA-treated infected larvae (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>), suggesting that exogenous BcnA gives infecting bacteria a survival advantage. Enhanced bacterial killing of BcnA-treated larvae was also observed for <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>A.Â baumannii</i>, and <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7C</a>). Together, the <i>in vivo</i> infection results underpin a biological role for BCNs in giving infecting bacteria of different species a survival advantage.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-6""><h3>Liposoluble vitamins inhibit BcnA-mediated antibiotic capture.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Conceivably, molecules with superior binding affinity for BCNs than that of antibiotics should prevent BCN-mediated resistance. Since lipophilic moieties are predicted to bind deep within the BCN pocket, we tested normal dietary hydrophobic supplements recommended for several patient groups, including cystic fibrosis patients, such as the fat-soluble vitamins Î±-tocopherol (vitamin E) and menaquinone (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>). Docking of Î±-tocopherol showed its alkyl chain buried in the BcnA tunnel and its cyclic head placed toward the entrance, similar to the Nile red binding pose (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). Of note, Î±-tocopherol, followed by menaquinone, exhibited very low <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values in Nile red displacement assays (~2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values of antibiotics), indicative of their high affinity for BcnA (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). This prompted us to test the BCN-inhibitory activity of fat-soluble vitamins <i>in vivo</i>. In BcnA-treated <i>G.Â mellonella</i> larvae infected with <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1, 10Â ÂµM Î±-tocopherol or menaquinone significantly reduced the survival advantage of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a>). This supports the notion that the protective function of BCN in infecting bacteria can be inhibited <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>).</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Lipocalins are an ancient family of small proteins found in all kingdoms of life that have the ability to bind hydrophobic ligands but have different functions, depending on the cell types and organisms (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). In many cases, and particularly in bacteria (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>), their function is unclear despite that BCN orthologs can be found in the majority of completed genomes by data mining. In this study, we discovered that secreted BCNs contribute to antibiotic resistance by capturing and neutralizing antibiotics in the bacterial milieu. BCNs bind a range of antibiotics with diverse chemical structures, increasing antibiotic resistance <i>in vitro</i> and enhancing bacterial survival <i>in vivo</i>. The effect of BCNs on multiple antibiotics and their wide conservation in most bacterial species distinguish this mechanism from the recently discovered effect of membrane-released phospholipids on daptomycin (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>), which is restricted to this particular antibiotic and to <i>S.Â aureus</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our structural work suggests that BCNs have two binding modes. Hydrophobic molecules like Nile red and vitamins E and K<sub>2</sub> can bind in the interior of the lipocalin tunnel, while antibiotic molecules interact with the rim and their binding properties are much weaker. This suggests that antibiotic binding and scavenging are not primary functions of secreted BCNs, but these proteins may also have other, as-yet-undiscovered, roles. We propose that the antibiotic binding ability of BCNs becomes particularly relevant under conditions in which antibiotics cannot effectively kill bacteria and their presence at sublethal concentrations elicits protective bacterial stress responses. Exposure to antibiotics triggers complex and multifactorial bacterial processes involving changes in regulation, metabolism, and energy generation (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a><a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33 B34 B35"">â</a><a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There is also a body of evidence indicating that antibiotics at sublethal concentrations can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a><a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38 B39 B40"">â</a><a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>) and also that oxidative stress associated with pathological inflammation reduces the efficacy of antibiotics (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). The increased <i>bcnA</i> transcription upon antibiotic treatment indicates that this gene responds to antibiotic-induced stress. Recent work with the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows that two lipocalins that are related to bacterial orthologs have distinct but overlapping functions essential for protection from lipid peroxidation (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). Further, the mammalian odorant-binding protein, a soluble lipocalin, protected the bacterial cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced stress when overexpressed in <i>E.Â coli</i> (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), whereas <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 BcnA1(Pa) was overexpressed in response to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). Donnarumma et al. (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) have recently suggested that the <i>Neisseria</i> BCN (GNA1030) is a ubiquinone-8 binding protein. Since ubiquinone-8 is a cofactor that is mainly involved in the electron transport chain (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>) and has antioxidant properties (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>), these authors propose a role for this protein in antioxidant defense, perhaps by delivering ubiquinone-8 to the bacterial membrane or the periplasmic space. Ubiquinones are prenylated benzoquinones. Interestingly, the majority of known crystal structures of bacterial lipocalins, including BcnA and BcnB, have been solved with octaprenyl-like molecules bound to the lipocalin tunnel, although it is not certain if the presence of this molecule corresponds to a physiological substrate or is an artifact associated with protein purification prior to crystallization. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to propose that BCNs could play a role in oxidative stress responses, the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, we have uncovered a new mechanism of general antibiotic resistance operating extracellularly based on BCN-mediated antibiotic capture that provides bacteria with a selective advantage to overcome antibiotic toxicity, particularly in chronic infections, where antibiotic treatment often fails. Further, we reveal a strategy to disrupt antibiotic capture and propose liposoluble vitamins as clinically usable BCN inhibitors.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">DNA manipulations were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). T4 DNA ligase (Roche Diagnostics), Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and restriction endonucleases were used as recommended by the manufacturers. Transformation of <i>E.Â coli</i> GT115 and DH5Î± was performed by the calcium chloride method (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Mobilization of plasmids into <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> was conducted by triparental mating (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) with <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± carrying the helper plasmid pRK2013 (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). DNA amplification by PCR was performed with a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using <i>Taq</i> or HotStar HiFidelity DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and optimized for each primer pair. DNA sequencing was carried out at Eurofins, Huntsville, AL. The DNA sequences were analyzed with the BLAST computer program and compared to the sequenced genome of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> strain J2315. The sequence of <i>S.Â aureus</i> gene SAUSA300_2620 was optimized for <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> codon usage and custom synthesized at Eurofins. Cloning, expression, and purification of bacteriocalins were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). Transcriptional fusions to <i>luxCDABE</i> and the subsequent luminescence expression assays were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a>). For site-directed mutagenesis, pOE16 was amplified with <i>Pfu</i> polymerase and the appropriate primer pairs; the PCR products were digested overnight with 1Â U of DpnI at 37Â°C and then introduced into <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± competent cells by transformation. Transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin; amino acid replacements were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Protein analysis and Western blotting.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.03 in 30Â ml of fresh LB medium with or without PmB and incubated for 3.5Â h at 37Â°C at 200Â rpm. Following incubation, cells equivalent to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.2 were pelleted, resuspended in 30Â Âµl of SDS-PAGE protein loading dye, and boiled to obtain whole-cell lysates. Secreted proteins were precipitated from the supernatant of the rest of the cultures with 10% trichloroacetic acid as previously described (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Precipitated proteins were resuspended in Tris buffer at 1Â M and pHÂ 7.5. The volume of protein samples loaded onto the 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was normalized to the OD<sub>600</sub> value. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4Â°C with Western blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) in TBST (50Â mM Tris-HCl [pHÂ 7.5], 150Â mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The primary antibody, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-Î±-subunit RNA polymerase (<i>E.Â coli</i>) (Neoclone, Madison, WI), was diluted to 1:15,000 in TBST and applied for 1.5Â h. The secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 680 IgG antibody (Invitrogen), was diluted to 1:15,000 and applied for 1Â h. Western blot assays were developed with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-4""><h3>Antibiotic susceptibility testing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The inoculum of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> K56-2, the appropriate mutants, and other bacterial species was prepared by the direct colony suspension method according to CLSI (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). Cultures with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.0008 in fresh cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) with or without the antibiotic were incubated at 37Â°C with medium shaking continuously in a Bioscreen C automated growth curve analyzer (MTX Lab Systems, Vienna, VA). Bacterial growth was assessed turbidimetrically at 600Â nm. E-test strips (AB BioMÃ©rieux, Solna, Sweden) were applied to agar plates (17Â ml of agar in an 85-mm petri dish) inoculated with test bacteria by swabbing overnight cultures diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.04; plates were then incubated at 37Â°C for 24Â h. Alternatively, population profiling analysis was performed turbidimetrically or by CFU counting as previously described (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). For <i>in vitro</i> protection assays, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> bacteriocalins were added to LB broth at a final concentration of 1.5Â ÂµM.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3> <i>In vitro</i> binding assays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In vitro binding assays were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), with a few modifications. Purified BCNs were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pHÂ 7.4). Phospholipids and Nile red were prepared in DMSO. The binding of each fluorescent probe to BCNs was measured by titrating 100Â Âµl of BCNs (1.5Â ÂµM) in a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate (LUMITRAC 200 White; Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) with aliquots of increasing concentrations of probe until the fluorescence intensity reached a plateau, indicating that all of the binding sites were occupied. All spectra were corrected for background fluorescence determined from probe-into-buffer titrations. Fluorescence was measured with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) set at an excitation wavelength (Î»<sub>ex</sub>) specific for each probe, as follows: Nile red, 550Â nm; BODIPY phospholipids, 500Â nm for fatty acyl BODIPY-labeled phosphocholine and 505Â nm for head group BODIPY-labeled phosphoethanolamine. The emission spectrum for each probe was collected across the following wavelengths (Î»<sub>em</sub>): Nile red, 590 to 750Â nm; BODIPY phospholipids, 510 to 665Â nm. The background-corrected binding fluorescence with each probe was fitted to a one-site binding model as previously described for human AGP (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). The equilibrium binding affinity constant for the probe-BCN complex (<i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>), the probe concentration needed to achieve half-maximum binding at equilibrium, was determined by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the binding isotherms with GraphPad Prism v 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For probe displacement experiments, antibiotic solutions and fat-soluble vitamins (prepared in DMSO) diluted in PBS, pHÂ 7.4, were titrated against a BCN-probe complex at a saturating concentration necessary to obtain the maximum fluorescence when bound. Probe displacement was measured as the corresponding decrease in fluorescence upon the progressive increase in the antibiotic concentration. The binding inhibition constants (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>s) of the test compounds were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with competition-binding equations for one-site binding calculated by GraphPad Prism v 5.0 software. The lower the <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values, the higher the affinity of the molecule for BcnA. All fluorometric assays were conducted in duplicate three independent times.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3> <i>G. mellonella</i> larva <i>in vivo</i> infection.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Larval infection assays were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>), with modifications. Overnight cultures were diluted in PBS, pHÂ 7.4, with or without <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BCNs at a 1.5 ÂµM final concentration to the following OD<sub>600</sub>s: <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> and <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1, 0.00004; <i>K.Â pneumoniae</i> Kpn18, 0.04; <i>A.Â baumannii</i> AB1, 0.4; <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300, 0.004. The larvae were injected with 10Â Âµl of the bacterial suspensions or sterile PBS (10 larvae/group in each experiment) with 10-Âµl MICROLITER syringes (Hamilton). The larvae were incubated at 30Â°C, and their viability was checked at regular time intervals. In similar assays, five larvae/group were sacrificed at 200Â min postinfection and the hemolymph was extracted as previously described (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). The hemolymph was immediately serially diluted in PBS and plated on LB agar supplemented with 0.3% cetrimide or 200Â Âµg/ml ampicillinâ25Â Âµg/ml PmB to quantify the CFU of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 or <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i>, respectively, recovered from the infected larvae.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-7""><h3>Intraperitoneal infection of mice.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A clinical isolate of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> (strain Q502) was grown overnight in nutrient broth at 37Â°C with constant agitation. The bacteria were centrifuged at 2,000 Ã <i>g</i> and washed three times in sterile, endotoxin-free PBS. The bacteria were resuspended in sterile, injection-grade saline, and the inoculum was adjusted to an OD of 0.5 (<i>A</i><sub>550</sub>). Female adult (8- to 12-week-old) C57BL6 mice were infected i.p. with 100Â Î¼l of the bacterial suspension. Subsequent growth of the inoculum on nutrient agar demonstrated that each animal received 10<sup>6</sup>Â CFU. Six mice per treatment were used. This was determined by GraphPad StatMate 2.0 to ensure 80% power to detect statistically significant effects between antibiotic-treated and untreated animals at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, two tailed. The actual power was &gt;99%. Mice were selected at random from open stock cages (10 per cage), earmarked to allow individual identification, and then sequentially placed into treatment groups. During the course of the experiment, mice were housed in individually ventilated cages. This method of assigning animals to groups ensures an approximately equal distribution of mice from different stock cages in each group to minimize the influence of cage-to-cage variability. At the time of inoculation, the mice were treated with the standard pediatric PmB dose of 20,000Â U/kg (<i>n</i> = 6), PmB and 100Â Âµl of 25Â ÂµM BCN (<i>n</i> = 6), BCN only (<i>n</i> = 6), or a saline control (<i>n</i> = 6) by i.p. injection. The individual components injected into mice were added to the same syringe immediately before i.p. injection. Animals were culled by cervical dislocation 4Â h postinoculation. That time point was selected because by that time point and under the infection conditions used, the untreated mice reach the humane endpoint and need to be culled, as defined within the UK Home Office license under which the experiments were carried out (PLL 2700). Because of the virulence of the clinical isolate and the dose of the bacterial inoculum and because the bacteria are delivered i.p., the mice rapidly succumb to the infection. In contrast, those given effective antibiotic treatment rapidly clear the infection and remain perfectly healthy. The vast divergence between the responses seen in this model provides us with the statistical power to robustly assess the microbial response to antibiotic therapies without requiring the use of a very large number of mice per group. We are therefore adhering to the reduction principle of the three Râs. The peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3.5Â ml of ice-cold, sterile, endotoxin-free PBS, and the volume recovered was recorded. Serial dilutions of the lavage fluid were plated onto cetrimide agar; and bacterial colonies were counted after 24Â h of growth at 37Â°C. Harvesting of the samples and quantification of the bacterial burdens in the mice were done while blinded to the treatment groups. Data were not normally distributed, and there was no equal variance between groups; therefore, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. The mouse infection experiments carried out were assessed by the Queenâs University Belfast animal welfare and ethical review body (AWERB) committee and conducted under a license issued by the UK Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, amended in 2012.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-8""><h3>Antibiotic bioassay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antibiotic test solutions with or without 1.5Â ÂµM BcnA were incubated for 30Â min at 37Â°C with rotation. The solutions were filtered through filter units with a 10-kDa cutoff by centrifugation at 7,500 Ã <i>g</i>, at 4Â°C for 10Â min. The antibiotic concentrations in the filtrates were determined by spotting 5Â Âµl onto sterile filter discs placed on agar plates swabbed with the test bacteria. Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) containing 40Â ml of LB agar were swabbed with bacterial suspensions with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.04. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 24Â h. Each plate included four discs containing standard concentrations of the antibiotic alongside the discs impregnated with test and control antibiotic solutions. <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± was used for bioassays of PmB, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and gentamicin, and <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 was used for bioassays of rifampin. The theoretical disc contents of the test antibiotic solutions were 10, 5, 2, 30, and 10Â Âµg for PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and gentamicin, respectively. Standard antibiotic discs contained a 2-fold higher concentration than, the same concentration as, or a 2- or 4-fold lower concentration than the test antibiotic discs. After incubation, the clear zones of inhibition were measured and the antibiotic concentrations were determined from standard curves constructed from the standard antibiotic discs.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-9""><h3>Structure determination.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">BcnA and BcnB were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and concentrated to ~20Â mg/ml in a mixture of 20Â mM Tris (pHÂ 7.5) and 100Â mM NaCl (1% DMSO for BcnB) with &gt;95% purity. Protein solutions were mixed 1:1 with mother liquor, and crystals were grown at room temperature. BcnA crystals grew with 0.1Â M Tris (pHÂ 8.5) and 2.4 M ammonium sulfate (final pH of 8.0) as the mother liquor. BcnB crystals grew with 0.1Â M HEPES (pHÂ 6.5)â26% polyethylene glycol 6000 as the mother liquor. Data sets were collected on beamline 08ID-1 at Canadian Light Sources (<a href=""#B54"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B54"">54</a>), integrated with iMOSFLM (<a href=""#B55"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B55"">55</a>), and scaled with AIMLESS (<a href=""#B56"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B56"">56</a>) from CCP4.

The BcnA and BcnB structures were refined with phenix.Refine (<a href=""#B60"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B60"">60</a>) from PHENIX and REFMAC5 (<a href=""#B61"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B61"">61</a>) from CCP4, respectively, with translation-libration-screw motion refinement for both.

<div role=""paragraph"">All of the following codes can be obtained under license agreement: AMBER 12 and AmberTools (<a href=""http://www.ambermd.org"">http://www.ambermd.org</a> ), Maestro Suite (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA), AutoDock 4.2.2, and AutoDockTools (<a href=""http://autodock.scripps.edu"">http://autodock.scripps.edu</a> ; free software). Amber and Maestro have Academic fees. We studied the stability of the two X-ray structures of BcnA and BcnB, as well as the D82A-D93A mutant, by MD simulations as implemented in AMBER 12. The initial model of D82A-D93A was built with AmberTools. Missing hydrogen atoms were added, and the protonation state of ionizable groups was computed by using Maestro Protein Preparation Wizard, version 9.3 (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA). Atom types and charges were assigned according to AMBER ff10 force field (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>). The three molecular systems were hydrated by using cubic boxes containing explicit TIP3P water molecules extending 10Â Ã away from any protein atom for simulating the aqueous environment with the help of AmberTools with added counterions to neutralize the system. Before the MD simulations, the two systems were equilibrated under the following protocol: an initial 8,000 steps of steepest-descent minimization, followed by heating of the system with position restraint (force constant of 20Â kcal mol<sup>â1</sup> Ã<sup>â2</sup>) for all protein atoms during 10Â ps of MD simulation increasing the temperature from 100Â K to 300Â K plus an additional 15Â ps at a constant temperature of 300Â K. Position restraint was gradually decreased for 100Â ps at a constant 300Â K, until the full system was under no restraint with constant temperature (300Â K) and pressure (1Â atm). After equilibration, 20Â ns of MD simulation was run at a constant temperature (300Â K) and pressure (1Â atm). Short- and long-range forces were calculated every one and two time steps, respectively (each time step was 2.0Â fs), constraining the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms to their equilibrium values. Long-range electrostatic interactions were accounted for by means of the particle mesh Ewald approach applying periodic boundary conditions. The RMSD as a function of time with respect to the starting structure of the Î±-C atoms was computed with CPPTRAJ (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>). The three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the structures of BcnA and BcnB subjected to the equilibration protocol described above were used for docking purposes. The two models were prepared for docking calculations by adding Kollman charges (<a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>) with the help of AutoDockTools.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">3D coordinates of norfloxacin, PmB, ceftazidime, gentamicin, Nile red, and Î±-tocopherol were built in Corina (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>) from the SMILES code. The 3D structure of rifampin was extracted from the crystallographic structure PDB accession no. <a href=""http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1LSV"">1LSV</a> . The structures of the seven ligands were protonated at pHÂ 7.0 with Epik (<a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>) and then optimized with MMFFs force field by with MacroModel version 9.9 (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA). Additionally, the structure of PmB was subjected to 100Â ps of MD simulation at 300Â K. Ligands were prepared for docking calculations with AutoDockTools by adding Gasteiger charges (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>) and setting all rotatable bonds free to move during the docking calculation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Docking calculations of all compounds were performed by means of AutoDock 4.2.2 (<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a>). Analysis was performed with the help of AutoDockTools. The grid point spacing was set at 0.375 angstroms, and a hexahedral box was built with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> dimensions of 21.00, 26.25, and 27.75 angstroms centered in the binding site of the protein. Two hundred runs with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm were performed with a population size of 100 and 250,000 energy evaluations. Side chains of residues Y85, W94, and Q41 were considered flexible during the docking protocol.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-11""><h3>BCN consensus motif determination.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A subset of 187 curated BcnA homologues from different bacterial species and families were used to obtain a consensus motif generated by the Gapped Local Alignment Motifs GLAM2 tool (<a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>). This motif was verified by analyzing an alignment of 1,995 BCN homologues with CLUSTAL-omega and visualized with JalView.

<div role=""paragraph"">Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 5.0. All of the results shown are the mean Â± the standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, data were assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution as determined by the DâAgostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test whenever possible, and hence, <i>t</i>Â tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. An unpaired <i>t</i>Â test was used to compare the means of two unmatched groups. A paired <i>t</i>Â test was used to compare the means of two matched groups, assuming that the before-and-after differences follow a Gaussian distribution. The sample size was chosen with GraphPad StatMate 2.0 to ensure a minimum of 80% power to detect statistically significant effects at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, two tailed. However, the actual power of most of the assays was â¥90% and in many cases exceeded 99%. In the case of MIC assays, the experiments were repeated three independent times and the experiment showing the lowest fold change (if applicable) was reported.</div></section></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focuses on targeting essential functions within bacterial cells. We discovered a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operating in the extracellular space, which depends on bacterial protein molecules called lipocalins. These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells.

<div role=""paragraph"">Treating infections is becoming increasingly difficult since microbes often show intrinsic high-level resistance to virtually all clinically approved antibiotics (<a href=""#B1"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B1"">1</a>). Ineffective microbial killing and exposure to sublethal antibiotic concentrations elicit adaptive bacterial stress responses, enhancing antibiotic resistance and tolerance (<a href=""#B2"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B2"">2</a><a href=""#B3"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B3 B4 B5 B6"">â</a><a href=""#B7"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B7"">7</a>). Much has been learned about antibiotic resistance mechanisms at the cellular level (<a href=""#B8"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B8"">8</a>, <a href=""#B9"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B9"">9</a>), but whether microbes subvert the action of antibiotics before they come in contact with bacterial cells has remained largely unexplored, with the exception of Î²-lactamases, which are often trapped in released membrane vesicles (<a href=""#B10"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B10"">10</a><a href=""#B11"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B11 B12"">â</a><a href=""#B13"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B13"">13</a>), and the recent observation that <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> inactivates daptomycin by releasing membrane phospholipids (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">
<i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> is a highly multidrug resistant, opportunistic, Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (<a href=""#B15"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B15"">15</a>). Bacteria of the genus <i>Burkholderia</i> are notorious for their ability to resist the action of multiple classes of antimicrobials (<a href=""#B16"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B16"">16</a>), representing an attractive model to understand intrinsic mechanisms of resistance in opportunistic bacteria. Recently, we showed that in response to sublethal antibiotic concentrations, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> produces and releases molecules such as the polyamine putrescine and YceI, a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). YceI proteins are a family of bacterial lipocalins (BCNs), which are small proteins widely conserved in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but whose physiological role is unclear (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>, <a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>). In coculture experiments, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> protects <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> from killing by different bactericidal antibiotics (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). This effect was abrogated in the <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> Î<i>bcnA-bcnB</i> double-deletion mutant (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>), but the individual contribution of each BCN paralog and its mechanism remained unknown.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Here, we show that secreted BcnA contributes to increased resistance of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> to various classes of antibiotics <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The expression of BCN orthologs from <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i>, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>S.Â aureus</i> in a <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant recapitulated this function. Experimental and computational studies revealed that BCNs bind to a range of antibiotics, thus preventing their antibacterial activity and contributing to resistance. X-ray crystallography studies of BCN structures, in combination with docking and MD simulations, have helped us to rationalize plausible binding modes. We also discovered that fat-soluble vitamins bound BcnA with a higher affinity than antibiotics, enabling them to outcompete antibiotics. This finding provides a clinically applicable strategy whereby known vitamins could become antibiotic adjuvants by increasing the concentration of free antibiotics in the proximity of bacterial cells, thereby boosting their microbicidal activity.</div></section><section id=""sec-2"" data-type=""results""><h2>RESULTS</h2>
<section id=""sec-2-1""><h3>BcnA is a secreted bacterial lipocalin required for full resistance of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> to different classes of antibiotics.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">We investigated the role of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA (BCAL3311) and BcnB (BCAL3310) by constructing individual deletion mutants in their corresponding genes and assessing bacterial susceptibility to model bactericidal antibiotics representing different classes, including rifamycins (mRNA transcription inhibitors), fluoroquinolones (DNA replication inhibitors), several Î²-lactams (cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors), and cationic antimicrobial peptides (cell membrane active agents). The Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant, but not the Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant, had increased susceptibility (4-fold MIC reduction) to rifampin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B (PmB) and a 2-fold meropenem MIC reduction. No effect was observed with the aminoglycoside gentamicin (protein synthesis inhibitor) (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>; see antibiotic chemical structures in <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a> in the supplemental material). Similarly, we also tested model bacteriostatic antibiotics representing different classes. The Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant, but not the Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant, had increased susceptibility to minocycline (tetracycline family protein synthesis inhibitor; 4-fold MIC reduction) and trimethoprim (pyrimidine inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase; 2-fold MIC reduction), while no effect was observed with the macrolide (protein synthesis inhibitor) azithromycin (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>; see <a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>).</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">The expression of the <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> genes in response to antibiotics at concentrations near the MIC (sublethal) was characterized by constructing chromosomal <i>lux</i> fusions. Expression of <i>bcnA</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> was upregulated upon exposure to PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). In contrast, <i>bcnA</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> expression in response to gentamicin remained unchanged (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1B</a>). Expression of <i>bcnB</i>::<i>luxCDABE</i> only increased upon exposure to norfloxacin and ceftazidime (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2A</a>). Thus, the <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> genes respond to antibiotic stress, but they appeared to be differentially regulated. <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> are located on the same strand 63Â bp apart (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1C</a>). Immediately upstream of <i>bcnA</i>, there is an open reading frame (BCAL3312), also transcribed on the same strand, that encodes a predicted cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>651</sub> protein. Putative promoter regions are found upstream of BCAL3312 and downstream from <i>bcnB</i>, next to a predicted Rho-independent transcription termination sequence. The genomic organization of the <i>bcn</i> region suggests that BCAL3312, <i>bcnA</i>, and <i>bcnB</i> are cotranscribed and may form an operon. However, the transcribed 63-bp intergenic region between <i>bcnA</i> and <i>bcnB</i> has the potential to form strong RNA secondary structures, which might explain the differential regulation of the two genes by antibiotics. The secretion of the BcnA and BcnB proteins was also investigated by using FLAG-tagged derivatives; only BcnA was secreted extracellularly into the growth medium (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2B</a>). From these experiments, we concluded that BcnA is the major contributor to intrinsic antibiotic resistance upon antibiotic stress and is secreted into the extracellular bacterial milieu.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">To demonstrate whether BCN orthologs from other bacteria could restore BcnA function in the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant strain, we tested BCNs of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 [PA0423, PA4340, and PA4345, which are BcnA1(Pa), BcnA2(Pa), and BcnA3(Pa), respectively, here], <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv [Rv1890c, which is BcnA(MTb) here], and community-acquired methicillin-resistant <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 [SAUSA300_2620, which is BcnA(Sa) here]. CFU counts on PmB-containing plates (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2A</a>) and E-test MICs of rifampin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone closely related to norfloxacin) (<a href=""#fig2"">Fig.Â 2B</a>) showed that heterologous expression of BCNs from these different bacteria restores antibiotic resistance to parental levels, indicating that these proteins have a conserved function.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-3""><h3>BcnA sequesters antibiotics.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">BCNs bind to diverse hydrophobic molecules (<a href=""#B20"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B20"">20</a><a href=""#B21"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B21"">â</a><a href=""#B22"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B22"">22</a>); hence, we hypothesized that BCNs could capture antibiotics and reduce their effective concentration in the bacterial milieu. An antibiotic bioassay demonstrated that BcnA sequestered rifampin, PmB, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime, in descending order of magnitude, but not gentamicin (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3A</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">E</a>). Further, the relative affinity of BcnA for antibiotics was determined <i>in vitro</i> by binding competition of antibiotics with Nile red in complex with BcnA. Nile red is a fluorophore used to test hydrophobic binding sites in proteins (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). The calculated binding inhibitory constants (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values) of the antibiotics (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3F</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">M</a>) mirrored their relative abilities to be sequestered by BcnA (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3A</a>) and the antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes of the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>). Notably, the binding of BcnB to Nile red occurred with ~20-fold lower affinity than that of BcnA (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3N</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">Q</a>), agreeing with the lesser role of BcnB in antibiotic resistance. The involvement of hydrophobic moieties in the interaction of ligands with BcnA was suggested by the significantly higher <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> value of the PmB nonapeptide, which lacks the hydrophobic N-terminal tail of PmB (<a href=""#B24"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B24"">24</a>), relative to that of PmB (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>; see <a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3F</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">I</a>). Notably, azithromycin and gentamicin, the only antibiotics not showing the antibiotic sensitivity reduction phenotype with the Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant (<a href=""#fig1"">Fig.Â 1A</a>), are the only antibiotics tested that lack aromatic or hydrophobic moieties (<a href=""#figS1"">Fig.Â S1</a>). To test polar hydrophilic binding sites in BcnA compared to hydrophobic sites, we used two related BODIPY dye-labeled phospholipids. BcnA increased the intensity of fluorescence of the BODIPY fluorophore when attached to the fatty acyl chain of the phospholipid in BODIPY-phosphocholine but not when attached to the hydrophilic polar head group (BODIPY-phosphoethanolamine) (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3R</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">T</a>). This further supported a role for fatty acyl chains in the interaction with hydrophobic sites in BcnA.</div>

</div></section><section id=""sec-2-4""><h3>Structure determination and molecular modeling reveal distinct docked binding modes for BcnA.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">To elucidate the mode of binding of antibiotics within BCNs, we first solved the X-ray crystal structures of BcnA and BcnB to 1.4- and 1.6-Ã resolutions, respectively (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>, <a href=""#tabS1"">TableÂ S1</a>, and <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4A</a> to <a href=""#figS4"">E</a>). Visual inspection and structural alignments by the DALI server (<a href=""#B25"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B25"">25</a>) confirmed a barrel-shaped lipocalin fold for both proteins (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4A</a> and <a href=""#fig4"">B</a>). An octaprenyl pyrophosphate was bound within a long, hydrophobic tunnel extending from one end of the barrel in each structure (<a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4A</a> and <a href=""#figS4"">B</a>). The binding of octaprenyl pyrophosphate potentially occurred during recombinant expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Analysis with the PDBePISA server (<a href=""#B26"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B26"">26</a>) predicted that BcnA is a monomer, while BcnB is a dimer, by crystallographic symmetry (~2,840Â Ã<sup>2</sup> of buried surface area including a portion of the tunnel opening). These oligomeric states were confirmed in solution by size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4C</a> and <a href=""#figS4"">D</a>). Superposition of BcnA chain A and BcnB chain C (148 CÎ± atoms, 22% sequence identity) resulted in a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.66Â Ã (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). The largest structural differences observed were located in two of the loops that make up the tunnel opening (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4C</a>). These differences may play a role in the antibiotic binding potential of BcnA and BcnB.</div>

</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Using the established crystallographic structures, we applied molecular modeling and docking calculations to predict BCN binding modes of antibiotics (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>). These studies suggested two distinct docked binding modes for BcnA. One binding mode involved residues in the rim of the lipocalin pocket (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4D</a>; see <a href=""#figS4"">Fig.Â S4F</a> to <a href=""#figS4"">I</a>). Polar interactions, mainly with polar residues, were observed with all of the antibiotics tested. There were also interactions between the aromatic moieties in PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, and ceftazidime and lipophilic residues. These interactions were not observed with gentamicin, which lacks aromatic moieties and binds weakly to BcnA. The second binding mode was predicted for more lipophilic molecules (e.g., Nile red), occurring deeper inside the lipophilic tunnel (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). Further, analyses from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations suggested both structural and ligand recognition roles for residues D82 and D93 (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>). These residues are located in the loops at the top of the tunnel opening of BcnA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and the BcnA<sub>D82A-D93A</sub> mutant showed decreased binding affinity for Nile red (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5A</a> and <a href=""#figS5"">B</a>), which we propose is due to structural changes (<a href=""#textS1"">TextÂ S1</a>; <a href=""#figS6"">Fig.Â S6A</a> to <a href=""#figS6"">E</a> and <a href=""#figS7"">S7</a>). Docking of Nile red into the BcnA<sub>D82A-D93A</sub> mutant (following the general docking protocol with the minimized average structure from ns 2.5 to ns 5 of the MD simulation) did not lead to any binding position inside the lipophilic tunnel (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7</a>). Interestingly, D93 is a highly conserved residue in the consensus motif of the BCN protein family (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5C</a>), exemplified in the alignment of BCN homologues (<a href=""#figS5"">Fig.Â S5D</a>). Further, Asp is found in positions equivalent to D82 in homologues of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA. Thus, it is credible that the mode of interaction between BcnA and antibiotics is common among this large family of conserved bacterial proteins.</div>

</div></aside></section><section id=""sec-2-5""><h3>Exogenous BcnA protects different bacterial species from antibiotic killing <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Since <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BcnA is secreted (<a href=""#figS2"">Fig.Â S2D</a>), as predicted for most other BCNs, we hypothesized that exogenous BCNs produced by one bacterial species have the potential to protect other bacteria from the action of antibiotics, including antimicrobial peptides. This was investigated by using purified recombinant BCNs from <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i>. <i>In vitro</i> antibiotic protection assays showed that <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 treated with 1.5Â ÂµM purified BcnA, but not BcnB, had reduced sensitivity to PmB (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5A</a>). In contrast, at 8- to 16-fold lower PmB concentrations, both proteins protected <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhi, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Acinetobacter lwoffii</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter junii</i> strains (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7A</a>). This disparity in the PmB concentrations at which protection by BcnA and BcnB occurs correlates with their relative affinities to Nile red (<a href=""#figS3"">Fig.Â S3N</a> to <a href=""#figS3"">Q</a>; see above). <i>In vivo</i> infections of C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that BcnA protected <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> Q502, a virulent cystic fibrosis clinical isolate (<a href=""#B27"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B27"">27</a>), from PmB killing in an intraperitoneal (i.p.) sepsis model (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5B</a>). We also employed the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larval infection model. The Î<i>bcnA</i> and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutants had reduced virulence in <i>G.Â mellonella</i> relative to that of the parent strain (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7B</a>). However, significantly lower numbers of Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant bacteria than parental and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant strain bacteria were recovered from the hemolymph of infected larvae at 200Â min postinfection (<a href=""#figS6"">Fig.Â S6B</a>), suggesting that Î<i>bcnA</i> mutant bacteria were more susceptible than Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant bacteria to the larval humoral immune response, which is mainly driven by host antimicrobial peptides (<a href=""#B28"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B28"">28</a>, <a href=""#B29"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B29"">29</a>), mirroring the different <i>in vitro</i> susceptibilities of Î<i>bcnA</i> and Î<i>bcnB</i> mutant bacteria to PmB. Similarly, infection of BcnA-treated <i>G.Â mellonella</i> larvae with <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 resulted in more rapid killing of the larvae than control or BcnB-treated larvae (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5C</a>). We recovered significantly higher numbers of bacterial CFU from the hemolymph of BcnA-treated infected larvae (<a href=""#fig5"">Fig.Â 5D</a>), suggesting that exogenous BcnA gives infecting bacteria a survival advantage. Enhanced bacterial killing of BcnA-treated larvae was also observed for <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>A.Â baumannii</i>, and <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 (<a href=""#figS7"">Fig.Â S7C</a>). Together, the <i>in vivo</i> infection results underpin a biological role for BCNs in giving infecting bacteria of different species a survival advantage.</div>

<div role=""paragraph"">Conceivably, molecules with superior binding affinity for BCNs than that of antibiotics should prevent BCN-mediated resistance. Since lipophilic moieties are predicted to bind deep within the BCN pocket, we tested normal dietary hydrophobic supplements recommended for several patient groups, including cystic fibrosis patients, such as the fat-soluble vitamins Î±-tocopherol (vitamin E) and menaquinone (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>). Docking of Î±-tocopherol showed its alkyl chain buried in the BcnA tunnel and its cyclic head placed toward the entrance, similar to the Nile red binding pose (<a href=""#fig4"">Fig.Â 4E</a>). Of note, Î±-tocopherol, followed by menaquinone, exhibited very low <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values in Nile red displacement assays (~2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than the <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values of antibiotics), indicative of their high affinity for BcnA (<a href=""#fig3"">Fig.Â 3B</a>). This prompted us to test the BCN-inhibitory activity of fat-soluble vitamins <i>in vivo</i>. In BcnA-treated <i>G.Â mellonella</i> larvae infected with <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1, 10Â ÂµM Î±-tocopherol or menaquinone significantly reduced the survival advantage of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6A</a>). This supports the notion that the protective function of BCN in infecting bacteria can be inhibited <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=""#fig6"">Fig.Â 6B</a>).</div>

</div></section></section><section id=""sec-3"" data-type=""discussion""><h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<div role=""paragraph"">Lipocalins are an ancient family of small proteins found in all kingdoms of life that have the ability to bind hydrophobic ligands but have different functions, depending on the cell types and organisms (<a href=""#B30"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B30"">30</a>, <a href=""#B31"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B31"">31</a>). In many cases, and particularly in bacteria (<a href=""#B18"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B18"">18</a>), their function is unclear despite that BCN orthologs can be found in the majority of completed genomes by data mining. In this study, we discovered that secreted BCNs contribute to antibiotic resistance by capturing and neutralizing antibiotics in the bacterial milieu. BCNs bind a range of antibiotics with diverse chemical structures, increasing antibiotic resistance <i>in vitro</i> and enhancing bacterial survival <i>in vivo</i>. The effect of BCNs on multiple antibiotics and their wide conservation in most bacterial species distinguish this mechanism from the recently discovered effect of membrane-released phospholipids on daptomycin (<a href=""#B14"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B14"">14</a>), which is restricted to this particular antibiotic and to <i>S.Â aureus</i>.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Our structural work suggests that BCNs have two binding modes. Hydrophobic molecules like Nile red and vitamins E and K<sub>2</sub> can bind in the interior of the lipocalin tunnel, while antibiotic molecules interact with the rim and their binding properties are much weaker. This suggests that antibiotic binding and scavenging are not primary functions of secreted BCNs, but these proteins may also have other, as-yet-undiscovered, roles. We propose that the antibiotic binding ability of BCNs becomes particularly relevant under conditions in which antibiotics cannot effectively kill bacteria and their presence at sublethal concentrations elicits protective bacterial stress responses. Exposure to antibiotics triggers complex and multifactorial bacterial processes involving changes in regulation, metabolism, and energy generation (<a href=""#B32"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B32"">32</a><a href=""#B33"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B33 B34 B35"">â</a><a href=""#B36"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B36"">36</a>).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">There is also a body of evidence indicating that antibiotics at sublethal concentrations can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (<a href=""#B37"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B37"">37</a><a href=""#B38"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B38 B39 B40"">â</a><a href=""#B41"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B41"">41</a>) and also that oxidative stress associated with pathological inflammation reduces the efficacy of antibiotics (<a href=""#B34"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B34"">34</a>). The increased <i>bcnA</i> transcription upon antibiotic treatment indicates that this gene responds to antibiotic-induced stress. Recent work with the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows that two lipocalins that are related to bacterial orthologs have distinct but overlapping functions essential for protection from lipid peroxidation (<a href=""#B42"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B42"">42</a>). Further, the mammalian odorant-binding protein, a soluble lipocalin, protected the bacterial cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced stress when overexpressed in <i>E.Â coli</i> (<a href=""#B43"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B43"">43</a>), whereas <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 BcnA1(Pa) was overexpressed in response to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat (<a href=""#B44"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B44"">44</a>). Donnarumma et al. (<a href=""#B19"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B19"">19</a>) have recently suggested that the <i>Neisseria</i> BCN (GNA1030) is a ubiquinone-8 binding protein. Since ubiquinone-8 is a cofactor that is mainly involved in the electron transport chain (<a href=""#B45"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B45"">45</a>) and has antioxidant properties (<a href=""#B46"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B46"">46</a>), these authors propose a role for this protein in antioxidant defense, perhaps by delivering ubiquinone-8 to the bacterial membrane or the periplasmic space. Ubiquinones are prenylated benzoquinones. Interestingly, the majority of known crystal structures of bacterial lipocalins, including BcnA and BcnB, have been solved with octaprenyl-like molecules bound to the lipocalin tunnel, although it is not certain if the presence of this molecule corresponds to a physiological substrate or is an artifact associated with protein purification prior to crystallization. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to propose that BCNs could play a role in oxidative stress responses, the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">In summary, we have uncovered a new mechanism of general antibiotic resistance operating extracellularly based on BCN-mediated antibiotic capture that provides bacteria with a selective advantage to overcome antibiotic toxicity, particularly in chronic infections, where antibiotic treatment often fails. Further, we reveal a strategy to disrupt antibiotic capture and propose liposoluble vitamins as clinically usable BCN inhibitors.</div></section><section id=""sec-4"" data-type=""materials methods""><h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<div role=""paragraph"">DNA manipulations were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B47"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B47"">47</a>). T4 DNA ligase (Roche Diagnostics), Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and restriction endonucleases were used as recommended by the manufacturers. Transformation of <i>E.Â coli</i> GT115 and DH5Î± was performed by the calcium chloride method (<a href=""#B48"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B48"">48</a>). Mobilization of plasmids into <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> was conducted by triparental mating (<a href=""#B49"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B49"">49</a>) with <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± carrying the helper plasmid pRK2013 (<a href=""#B50"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B50"">50</a>). DNA amplification by PCR was performed with a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using <i>Taq</i> or HotStar HiFidelity DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and optimized for each primer pair. DNA sequencing was carried out at Eurofins, Huntsville, AL. The DNA sequences were analyzed with the BLAST computer program and compared to the sequenced genome of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> strain J2315. The sequence of <i>S.Â aureus</i> gene SAUSA300_2620 was optimized for <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> codon usage and custom synthesized at Eurofins.

For site-directed mutagenesis, pOE16 was amplified with <i>Pfu</i> polymerase and the appropriate primer pairs; the PCR products were digested overnight with 1Â U of DpnI at 37Â°C and then introduced into <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± competent cells by transformation. Transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin; amino acid replacements were confirmed by DNA sequencing.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-3""><h3>Protein analysis and Western blotting.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.03 in 30Â ml of fresh LB medium with or without PmB and incubated for 3.5Â h at 37Â°C at 200Â rpm. Following incubation, cells equivalent to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.2 were pelleted, resuspended in 30Â Âµl of SDS-PAGE protein loading dye, and boiled to obtain whole-cell lysates. Secreted proteins were precipitated from the supernatant of the rest of the cultures with 10% trichloroacetic acid as previously described (<a href=""#B51"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B51"">51</a>). Precipitated proteins were resuspended in Tris buffer at 1Â M and pHÂ 7.5. The volume of protein samples loaded onto the 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was normalized to the OD<sub>600</sub> value. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4Â°C with Western blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) in TBST (50Â mM Tris-HCl [pHÂ 7.5], 150Â mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The primary antibody, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-Î±-subunit RNA polymerase (<i>E.Â coli</i>) (Neoclone, Madison, WI), was diluted to 1:15,000 in TBST and applied for 1.5Â h. The secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 680 IgG antibody (Invitrogen), was diluted to 1:15,000 and applied for 1Â h. Western blot assays were developed with the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).</div></section><section id=""sec-4-4""><h3>Antibiotic susceptibility testing.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">The inoculum of <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> K56-2, the appropriate mutants, and other bacterial species was prepared by the direct colony suspension method according to CLSI (<a href=""#B52"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B52"">52</a>). Cultures with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.0008 in fresh cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) with or without the antibiotic were incubated at 37Â°C with medium shaking continuously in a Bioscreen C automated growth curve analyzer (MTX Lab Systems, Vienna, VA). Bacterial growth was assessed turbidimetrically at 600Â nm. E-test strips (AB BioMÃ©rieux, Solna, Sweden) were applied to agar plates (17Â ml of agar in an 85-mm petri dish) inoculated with test bacteria by swabbing overnight cultures diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.04; plates were then incubated at 37Â°C for 24Â h. Alternatively, population profiling analysis was performed turbidimetrically or by CFU counting as previously described (<a href=""#B17"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B17"">17</a>). For <i>in vitro</i> protection assays, <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> bacteriocalins were added to LB broth at a final concentration of 1.5Â ÂµM.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-5""><h3> <i>In vitro</i> binding assays.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">In vitro binding assays were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>), with a few modifications. Purified BCNs were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pHÂ 7.4). Phospholipids and Nile red were prepared in DMSO. The binding of each fluorescent probe to BCNs was measured by titrating 100Â Âµl of BCNs (1.5Â ÂµM) in a flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plate (LUMITRAC 200 White; Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) with aliquots of increasing concentrations of probe until the fluorescence intensity reached a plateau, indicating that all of the binding sites were occupied. All spectra were corrected for background fluorescence determined from probe-into-buffer titrations. Fluorescence was measured with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) set at an excitation wavelength (Î»<sub>ex</sub>) specific for each probe, as follows: Nile red, 550Â nm; BODIPY phospholipids, 500Â nm for fatty acyl BODIPY-labeled phosphocholine and 505Â nm for head group BODIPY-labeled phosphoethanolamine. The emission spectrum for each probe was collected across the following wavelengths (Î»<sub>em</sub>): Nile red, 590 to 750Â nm; BODIPY phospholipids, 510 to 665Â nm. The background-corrected binding fluorescence with each probe was fitted to a one-site binding model as previously described for human AGP (<a href=""#B23"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B23"">23</a>). The equilibrium binding affinity constant for the probe-BCN complex (<i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>), the probe concentration needed to achieve half-maximum binding at equilibrium, was determined by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the binding isotherms with GraphPad Prism v 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">For probe displacement experiments, antibiotic solutions and fat-soluble vitamins (prepared in DMSO) diluted in PBS, pHÂ 7.4, were titrated against a BCN-probe complex at a saturating concentration necessary to obtain the maximum fluorescence when bound. Probe displacement was measured as the corresponding decrease in fluorescence upon the progressive increase in the antibiotic concentration. The binding inhibition constants (<i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>s) of the test compounds were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with competition-binding equations for one-site binding calculated by GraphPad Prism v 5.0 software. The lower the <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values, the higher the affinity of the molecule for BcnA. All fluorometric assays were conducted in duplicate three independent times.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-6""><h3> <i>G. mellonella</i> larva <i>in vivo</i> infection.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Larval infection assays were performed as previously described (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>), with modifications. Overnight cultures were diluted in PBS, pHÂ 7.4, with or without <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> BCNs at a 1.5 ÂµM final concentration to the following OD<sub>600</sub>s: <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i> and <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1, 0.00004; <i>K.Â pneumoniae</i> Kpn18, 0.04; <i>A.Â baumannii</i> AB1, 0.4; <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300, 0.004. The larvae were injected with 10Â Âµl of the bacterial suspensions or sterile PBS (10 larvae/group in each experiment) with 10-Âµl MICROLITER syringes (Hamilton). The larvae were incubated at 30Â°C, and their viability was checked at regular time intervals. In similar assays, five larvae/group were sacrificed at 200Â min postinfection and the hemolymph was extracted as previously described (<a href=""#B53"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B53"">53</a>). The hemolymph was immediately serially diluted in PBS and plated on LB agar supplemented with 0.3% cetrimide or 200Â Âµg/ml ampicillinâ25Â Âµg/ml PmB to quantify the CFU of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1 or <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i>, respectively, recovered from the infected larvae.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-7""><h3>Intraperitoneal infection of mice.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A clinical isolate of <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> (strain Q502) was grown overnight in nutrient broth at 37Â°C with constant agitation. The bacteria were centrifuged at 2,000 Ã <i>g</i> and washed three times in sterile, endotoxin-free PBS. The bacteria were resuspended in sterile, injection-grade saline, and the inoculum was adjusted to an OD of 0.5 (<i>A</i><sub>550</sub>). Female adult (8- to 12-week-old) C57BL6 mice were infected i.p. with 100Â Î¼l of the bacterial suspension. Subsequent growth of the inoculum on nutrient agar demonstrated that each animal received 10<sup>6</sup>Â CFU. Six mice per treatment were used. This was determined by GraphPad StatMate 2.0 to ensure 80% power to detect statistically significant effects between antibiotic-treated and untreated animals at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, two tailed. The actual power was &gt;99%. Mice were selected at random from open stock cages (10 per cage), earmarked to allow individual identification, and then sequentially placed into treatment groups. During the course of the experiment, mice were housed in individually ventilated cages. This method of assigning animals to groups ensures an approximately equal distribution of mice from different stock cages in each group to minimize the influence of cage-to-cage variability. At the time of inoculation, the mice were treated with the standard pediatric PmB dose of 20,000Â U/kg (<i>n</i> = 6), PmB and 100Â Âµl of 25Â ÂµM BCN (<i>n</i> = 6), BCN only (<i>n</i> = 6), or a saline control (<i>n</i> = 6) by i.p. injection. The individual components injected into mice were added to the same syringe immediately before i.p. injection. Animals were culled by cervical dislocation 4Â h postinoculation. That time point was selected because by that time point and under the infection conditions used, the untreated mice reach the humane endpoint and need to be culled, as defined within the UK Home Office license under which the experiments were carried out (PLL 2700). Because of the virulence of the clinical isolate and the dose of the bacterial inoculum and because the bacteria are delivered i.p., the mice rapidly succumb to the infection. In contrast, those given effective antibiotic treatment rapidly clear the infection and remain perfectly healthy. The vast divergence between the responses seen in this model provides us with the statistical power to robustly assess the microbial response to antibiotic therapies without requiring the use of a very large number of mice per group. We are therefore adhering to the reduction principle of the three Râs. The peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3.5Â ml of ice-cold, sterile, endotoxin-free PBS, and the volume recovered was recorded. Serial dilutions of the lavage fluid were plated onto cetrimide agar; and bacterial colonies were counted after 24Â h of growth at 37Â°C. Harvesting of the samples and quantification of the bacterial burdens in the mice were done while blinded to the treatment groups. Data were not normally distributed, and there was no equal variance between groups; therefore, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. The mouse infection experiments carried out were assessed by the Queenâs University Belfast animal welfare and ethical review body (AWERB) committee and conducted under a license issued by the UK Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, amended in 2012.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-8""><h3>Antibiotic bioassay.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Antibiotic test solutions with or without 1.5Â ÂµM BcnA were incubated for 30Â min at 37Â°C with rotation. The solutions were filtered through filter units with a 10-kDa cutoff by centrifugation at 7,500 Ã <i>g</i>, at 4Â°C for 10Â min. The antibiotic concentrations in the filtrates were determined by spotting 5Â Âµl onto sterile filter discs placed on agar plates swabbed with the test bacteria. Petri dishes (15-cm diameter) containing 40Â ml of LB agar were swabbed with bacterial suspensions with an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.04. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 24Â h. Each plate included four discs containing standard concentrations of the antibiotic alongside the discs impregnated with test and control antibiotic solutions. <i>E.Â coli</i> DH5Î± was used for bioassays of PmB, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and gentamicin, and <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300 was used for bioassays of rifampin. The theoretical disc contents of the test antibiotic solutions were 10, 5, 2, 30, and 10Â Âµg for PmB, rifampin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and gentamicin, respectively. Standard antibiotic discs contained a 2-fold higher concentration than, the same concentration as, or a 2- or 4-fold lower concentration than the test antibiotic discs.

<div role=""paragraph"">BcnA and BcnB were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and concentrated to ~20Â mg/ml in a mixture of 20Â mM Tris (pHÂ 7.5) and 100Â mM NaCl (1% DMSO for BcnB) with &gt;95% purity. Protein solutions were mixed 1:1 with mother liquor, and crystals were grown at room temperature. BcnA crystals grew with 0.1Â M Tris (pHÂ 8.5) and 2.4 M ammonium sulfate (final pH of 8.0) as the mother liquor. BcnB crystals grew with 0.1Â M HEPES (pHÂ 6.5)â26% polyethylene glycol 6000 as the mother liquor.

<div role=""paragraph"">All of the following codes can be obtained under license agreement: AMBER 12 and AmberTools (<a href=""http://www.ambermd.org"">http://www.ambermd.org</a> ), Maestro Suite (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA), AutoDock 4.2.2, and AutoDockTools (<a href=""http://autodock.scripps.edu"">http://autodock.scripps.edu</a> ; free software). Amber and Maestro have Academic fees. We studied the stability of the two X-ray structures of BcnA and BcnB, as well as the D82A-D93A mutant, by MD simulations as implemented in AMBER 12. The initial model of D82A-D93A was built with AmberTools. Missing hydrogen atoms were added, and the protonation state of ionizable groups was computed by using Maestro Protein Preparation Wizard, version 9.3 (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA). Atom types and charges were assigned according to AMBER ff10 force field (<a href=""#B63"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B63"">63</a>). The three molecular systems were hydrated by using cubic boxes containing explicit TIP3P water molecules extending 10Â Ã away from any protein atom for simulating the aqueous environment with the help of AmberTools with added counterions to neutralize the system. Before the MD simulations, the two systems were equilibrated under the following protocol: an initial 8,000 steps of steepest-descent minimization, followed by heating of the system with position restraint (force constant of 20Â kcal mol<sup>â1</sup> Ã<sup>â2</sup>) for all protein atoms during 10Â ps of MD simulation increasing the temperature from 100Â K to 300Â K plus an additional 15Â ps at a constant temperature of 300Â K. Position restraint was gradually decreased for 100Â ps at a constant 300Â K, until the full system was under no restraint with constant temperature (300Â K) and pressure (1Â atm). After equilibration, 20Â ns of MD simulation was run at a constant temperature (300Â K) and pressure (1Â atm). Short- and long-range forces were calculated every one and two time steps, respectively (each time step was 2.0Â fs), constraining the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms to their equilibrium values. Long-range electrostatic interactions were accounted for by means of the particle mesh Ewald approach applying periodic boundary conditions. The RMSD as a function of time with respect to the starting structure of the Î±-C atoms was computed with CPPTRAJ (<a href=""#B64"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B64"">64</a>). The three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the structures of BcnA and BcnB subjected to the equilibration protocol described above were used for docking purposes. The two models were prepared for docking calculations by adding Kollman charges (<a href=""#B65"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B65"">65</a>) with the help of AutoDockTools.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">3D coordinates of norfloxacin, PmB, ceftazidime, gentamicin, Nile red, and Î±-tocopherol were built in Corina (<a href=""#B66"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B66"">66</a>) from the SMILES code. The 3D structure of rifampin was extracted from the crystallographic structure PDB accession no. <a href=""http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1LSV"">1LSV</a> . The structures of the seven ligands were protonated at pHÂ 7.0 with Epik (<a href=""#B67"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B67"">67</a>) and then optimized with MMFFs force field by with MacroModel version 9.9 (SchrÃ¶dinger, Cambridge, MA). Additionally, the structure of PmB was subjected to 100Â ps of MD simulation at 300Â K. Ligands were prepared for docking calculations with AutoDockTools by adding Gasteiger charges (<a href=""#B68"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B68"">68</a>) and setting all rotatable bonds free to move during the docking calculation.</div>
<div role=""paragraph"">Docking calculations of all compounds were performed by means of AutoDock 4.2.2 (<a href=""#B69"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B69"">69</a>). Analysis was performed with the help of AutoDockTools. The grid point spacing was set at 0.375 angstroms, and a hexahedral box was built with <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> dimensions of 21.00, 26.25, and 27.75 angstroms centered in the binding site of the protein. Two hundred runs with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm were performed with a population size of 100 and 250,000 energy evaluations. Side chains of residues Y85, W94, and Q41 were considered flexible during the docking protocol.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-11""><h3>BCN consensus motif determination.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">A subset of 187 curated BcnA homologues from different bacterial species and families were used to obtain a consensus motif generated by the Gapped Local Alignment Motifs GLAM2 tool (<a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>). This motif was verified by analyzing an alignment of 1,995 BCN homologues with CLUSTAL-omega and visualized with JalView. In addition, upon submitting the predicted motif to the GLAM2Scan database (<a href=""#B70"" role=""doc-biblioref"" data-xml-rid=""B70"">70</a>) against <i>B.Â cenocepacia</i>, <i>P.Â aeruginosa</i> PAO1, <i>M.Â tuberculosis</i> H37Rv, and <i>S.Â aureus</i> USA300, the correct homologues only were detected as BCNs for each of the organisms.</div></section><section id=""sec-4-12""><h3>Statistical analyses.</h3>
<div role=""paragraph"">Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 5.0. All of the results shown are the mean Â± the standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, data were assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution as determined by the DâAgostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test whenever possible, and hence, <i>t</i>Â tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used. An unpaired <i>t</i>Â test was used to compare the means of two unmatched groups. A paired <i>t</i>Â test was used to compare the means of two matched groups, assuming that the before-and-after differences follow a Gaussian distribution. The sample size was chosen with GraphPad StatMate 2.0 to ensure a minimum of 80% power to detect statistically significant effects at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, two tailed. However, the actual power of most of the assays was â¥90% and in many cases exceeded 99%. In the case of MIC assays, the experiments were repeated three independent times and the experiment showing the lowest fold change (if applicable) was reported.</div></section></section><section id=""acknowledgments"" role=""doc-acknowledgments""><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
