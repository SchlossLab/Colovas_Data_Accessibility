A comprehensive benchmark is presented, including open-source tools and the popular USEARCH suite. Simulated, mock, and environmental communities were used to analyze sensitivity, selectivity, species diversity (alpha and beta), and taxonomic composition. The results demonstrate that recent clustering algorithms can significantly improve accuracy and preserve estimated diversity without the application of aggressive filtering. Moreover, these tools are all open source, apply multiple levels of multithreading, and scale to the demands of modern next-generation sequencing data, which is essential for the analysis of massive multidisciplinary studies such as the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) (J.

Therefore, we investigated the topological relationships of human and bacterial viruses and how they interact with their hosts. We focused on those host proteins that are directly targeted by viruses, those that are required for infection, and those that are essential for both human and bacterial cells (here,

This study explores the unusual sulfur acquisition strategy that has evolved in these cells, which lack assimilatory sulfate reduction and instead rely on reduced sulfur compounds found in oxic marine environments to meet their cellular quotas. Our findings demonstrate that the sulfur acquisition systems are constitutively expressed but the enzymatic steps leading to the essential sulfur-containing amino acid methionine are regulated by a unique array of riboswitches and genes, many of which are encoded in a rapidly evolving genome region. These findings support mounting evidence that streamlined cells have evolved regulatory mechanisms that minimize transcriptional switching and, unexpectedly, localize essential sulfur acquisition genes in a genome region normally associated with adaption to environmental variation.

            The microbial production of methane or “biogas” is an attractive renewable energy technology that can recycle organic waste into biofuel. Biogas reactors operating with protein-rich substrates such as household municipal or agricultural wastes have significant industrial and societal value; however, they are highly unstable and frequently collapse due to the accumulation of ammonia. We report the discovery of a novel uncultured phylotype (unFirm_1) that is highly detectable in metaproteomic data generated from an ammonia-tolerant commercial reactor. Importantly, unFirm_1 is proposed to perform a key metabolic step in biogas microbiomes, whereby it syntrophically oxidizes acetate to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which methanogens then covert to methane. Only very few culturable syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria have been described, and all were detected at low
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            levels compared to unFirm_1. Broader comparisons produced the hypothesis that unFirm_1 is a key mediator toward the successful long-term stable operation of biogas production using protein-rich substrates.

            Prokaryotes are thought to regulate their proteomes largely at the level of transcription. However, the results from this first set of global transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of paired microbial samples presented here show that this assumption is false for the majority of genes and their products in

            . In addition, the tenuousness of the link between transcription and translation becomes even more pronounced when microbes exist in a biofilm or a stationary planktonic state. Since the transcriptome level does not usually equal the proteome level, the validity attributed to gene expression studies as well as proteomic studies in microbial analyses must be brought into question. Therefore, the results attained by either approach, whether RNA-seq or shotgun proteomics, must be taken in context and evaluated with particular care since they are by no means interchangeable.

            Thermal interventions are commonly used in the food industry as a means of mitigating pathogen contamination in food products. Concern over heat-resistant food contaminants has recently increased, with the identification of a conserved locus shown to confer heat resistance in disparate lineages of Gram-negative bacteria. Complete sequence analysis of a historical isolate of

Phylogenetic analysis of these loci in comparison with homologs identified in various bacterial genera provides an opportunity to examine the evolution and distribution of loci conferring resistance to environmental stressors, such as heat and desiccation.

            Early infant exposure is important in the acquisition and ultimate development of a healthy infant microbiome. There is increasing support for the idea that the maternal microbial reservoir is a key route of microbial transmission, and yet much is inferred from the observation of shared species in mother and infant. The presence of common species,
            <jats:italic>per se</jats:italic>
            , does not necessarily equate to vertical transmission, as species exhibit considerable strain heterogeneity. It is therefore imperative to assess whether shared microbes belong to the same genetic variant (i.e., strain) to support the hypothesis of vertical transmission. Here we demonstrate the potential of shotgun metagenomics and strain-level profiling to identify vertical transmission events. Combining these data with metatranscriptomics, we show that it is possible not only to identify and track the fate of microbes in the early infant microbiome but also to investigate the actively transcribing members of the community. These approaches will ultimately provide important insights into the acquisition, development, and community dynamics of the infant microbiome.

The results suggest that the phylogenetic relationships were mostly influenced by metabolic trait enrichment, which is possibly governed by the microenvironment of each microbe’s respective niche. Using core genome analysis, the enrichment of a certain set of genes specific to a particular habitat was determined, which provided insights on the influence of habitat on the distribution of metabolic traits for

            Mycoplasmas are pathogenic bacteria that cause serious chronic infections in production animals, resulting in considerable losses worldwide, as well as causing disease in humans. These bacteria have extremely reduced genomes and are thought to have limited metabolic flexibility, even though they are highly successful persistent parasites in a diverse number of species. The extent to which different
            <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic>
            species are capable of catabolizing host carbon sources and nutrients, or synthesizing essential metabolites, remains poorly defined. We have used advanced metabolomic techniques to identify metabolic pathways that are active in two species of
            <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic>
            that infect distinct hosts (poultry and cattle). We show that these species exhibit marked differences in metabolite steady-state levels and carbon source utilization. This information has been used to functionally characterize previously unknown genes in the genomes of these pathogens. These species-specific differences are likely to reflect important differences in host nutrient levels and pathogenic mechanisms.

            Oxalate is a central component in 80% of kidney stones. While mammals do not possess the enzymes to degrade oxalate, many gastrointestinal bacteria are efficient oxalate degraders. We examined the role of cohesive microbial networks for oxalate metabolism, using Sprague-Dawley rats as a model host. While the transplantation of oxalate-degrading bacteria alone to the Sprague-Dawley hosts did increase oxalate metabolism, fecal transplants from a wild mammalian herbivore,

            Emerging evidence suggests that environmental toxicants may influence inflammation-promoted chronic disease susceptibility during early life. BPA, an environmental endocrine disruptor, can transfer across the placenta and accumulate in fetal gut and liver. However, underlying mechanisms for BPA-induced colonic and liver inflammation are not fully elucidated. In this report, we show how perinatal BPA exposure in rabbits alters gut microbiota and their metabolite profiles, which leads to colonic and liver inflammation as well as to increased gut permeability as measured by elevated serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the offspring. Also, perinatal BPA exposure leads to reduced levels of gut bacterial diversity and bacterial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids [SCFA]) and elevated gut permeability—three common early biomarkers of inflammation-promoted chronic diseases. In addition, we showed that SCFA ameliorated BPA-induced intestinal permeability

Therefore, we undertook the largest genomic study of GBS CC17 strains to date to decipher the genetic bases of their remarkable colonization and infection ability. We show that crucial functions involved in different steps of the colonization or infection process of GBS are distinctly mutated during the adaptation of CC17 to the human host. In particular, our results implicate the CovRS two-component regulator of virulence in the differentiation between carriage- and disease-associated isolates. Not only does this work raise important implications for the ongoing development of a vaccine against GBS but might also drive the discovery of key functions for GBS adaptation and pathogenesis that have been overlooked until now.

The methods were highly comparable and highly repeatable in three sample types with high microbial biomass (cecum, colon, and feces), but larger differences and low repeatability were found in the microbiomes obtained from the ileum and cloaca.

            The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains have serious medical and clinical consequences. In addition, the rate of discovery of new therapeutic antibiotics has been inadequate in last few decades. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin represent a precious therapeutic resource in the fight against bacterial pathogens. However, these antibiotics have been gradually losing their appeal due to the emergence and buildup of resistance to them. In this report, we shed light on the genome-level expression changes in bacteria with respect to glutathione (GSH) exposure which act as a trigger for fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance. The knowledge about different bacterial stress response pathways under conditions of exposure to the conditions described above and potential points of cross talk between them could help us in understanding and formulating the conditions under which buildup and spread of antibiotic resistance could be minimized. Our findings are also relevant because GSH-induced genome-level expression changes have not been reported previously for

In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network. Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation.

After analysis of genomewide distribution of wild-type and RpoZ-defective RNAP by the ChIP-chip method, we found alteration of the RpoZ-defective RNAP inside open reading frames, in particular, of the genes within prophages. For a set of the genes that exhibited altered occupancy of the RpoZ-defective RNAP, transcription was found to be altered as observed by qRT-PCR assay. All the observations here described indicate the involvement of RpoZ in recognition of some of the prophage genes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression and have important roles in cancer development. Here, we investigated the link between the gut microbiota and the expression of miRNA in CRC. We found that dozens of miRNAs are differentially regulated in CRC tumors and adjacent normal colon and that these miRNAs are correlated with the abundance of microbes in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we found that microbes that have been previously associated with CRC are correlated with miRNAs that regulate genes related to interactions with microbes. Notably, these miRNAs likely regulate glycan production, which is important for the recruitment of pathogenic microbial taxa to the tumor. This work provides a first systems-level map of the association between microbes and host miRNAs in the context of CRC and provides targets for further experimental validation and potential interventions.</jats:p>",en,mSystems,,,,,,,NA,NA,,10.1128_msystems.00205-17,Data/html/10.1128_msystems.00205-17

It is relevant across many biological systems—particularly in virus-microbe communities, but also in gene regulatory networks, neural networks, and ecological communities broadly. Correlation-based inference—using correlations to predict interactions—is widespread. However, it is well-known that “correlation does not imply causation.” Despite this, many studies apply correlation-based inference methods to experimental time series without first assessing the potential scope for accurate inference.

            Ancient biomolecules from oral and gut microbiome samples have been shown to be preserved in the archaeological record. Studying ancient microbiome communities using metagenomic techniques offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of microbial communities through time. DNA accumulates specific damage over time, which could potentially affect taxonomic classification and our ability to accurately reconstruct community assemblages. It is therefore necessary to assess whether ancient DNA (aDNA) damage patterns affect metagenomic taxonomic profiling. Here, we assessed biases in community structure, diversity, species detection, and relative abundance estimates by five popular metagenomic taxonomic classification programs using
            <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>
            -generated data sets with and without aDNA damage. Damage patterns had minimal impact on the taxonomic profiles produced by each program, while false-positive rates and biases were intrinsic to each program. Therefore, the most appropriate classification program is one that minimizes the biases related to the questions being addressed.

For example, is phylosymbiosis a result of coevolution, or can it be generated by simple ecological filtering processes? Beyond qualitative theoretical models, quantitative theoretical expectations can provide new insights. For example, deviations from a simple baseline of ecological filtering may be used to test more-complex hypotheses (e.g., coevolution). Here, we use simulations to provide evidence that simple host-related ecological filtering can readily generate phylosymbiosis, and we contrast these predictions with real-world data. We find that while phylosymbiosis is widespread in nature, phylosymbiosis patterns are compatible with a simple ecological model in the majority of taxa. Internal compartments of hosts, such as the animal gut, often display stronger phylosymbiosis than expected from a purely ecological filtering process, suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved.</jats:p>",en,mSystems,,,,,,,NA,NA,,10.1128_msystems.00097-18,Data/html/10.1128_msystems.00097-18

            Cellulose is the most abundant renewable polymer on earth, but its recalcitrance limits highly efficient conversion methods for energy-related and material applications.

            Genome evolution of microbes involves parent-to-offspring descent, and lateral genetic transfer that convolutes the phylogenomic signal. This study investigated phylogenomic signals among thousands of microbial genomes based on short subsequences without using multiple-sequence alignment. The signal from ribosomal RNAs is strong across all taxa, and the signal of plasmids is strong only in closely related groups, particularly
            <jats:italic>Proteobacteria</jats:italic>
            . However, the signal from other chromosomal regions (∼99% of the genomes) is remarkably restricted in breadth. The similarity of subsequences is found to correlate with taxonomic rank and informs on conserved and differential core functions relative to niche specialization and evolutionary diversification of microbes. These results provide a comprehensive, alignment-free view of microbial genome evolution as a network, beyond a tree-like structure.

However, this effect is efficiently countered when the system also contains a predator that feeds on bacteria. Moreover, when the environment contains antibiotics, the survival of resistance is dependent on the resistance mechanism. When bacteria can help their contemporaries to degrade antibiotics, resistance is maintained by only a fraction of the community. On the other hand, when bacteria cannot help others, then all bacteria remain resistant. The concentration of the antibiotic played a less notable role than the antibiotic used.

            The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in human and animal health, and its disorder causes multiple diseases. Over the past decade, FMT has gained increasing attention due to the success in treating

            Steroids are ubiquitous and abundant natural compounds that display recalcitrance. Biodegradation via sludge communities in wastewater treatment plants is the primary removal process for steroids. To date, compared to studies for aerobic steroid degradation, the knowledge of anaerobic degradation of steroids has been based on only a few model organisms. Due to the increase of anthropogenic impacts, steroid inputs may affect microbial diversity and functioning in ecosystems. Here, we first investigated microbial functional responses to cholesterol, the most abundant steroid in sludge, at the community level. Our metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses revealed that the capacities for cholesterol approach, uptake, and degradation are unique traits of certain low-abundance betaproteobacteria, indicating the importance of the rare biosphere in bioremediation. Apparent expression of genes involved in cofactor

The virome of animals is often dominated by bacterial viruses, known as bacteriophages or phages, which can (re)structure bacterial communities potentially vital to the animal host. Beta diversity relationships of animal-associated bacterial communities in laboratory and wild populations frequently parallel animal phylogenetic relationships, a pattern termed phylosymbiosis.

            has been highlighted by the recent WHO Global Priority Pathogen List due to multidrug resistance. Without new antibiotics, polymyxins remain a last-line therapeutic option for this difficult-to-treat pathogen. The emergence of polymyxin resistance highlights the growing threat to our already very limited antibiotic armamentarium and the urgency to understand the exact mechanisms of polymyxin activity and resistance. Integration of the correlative metabolomics and transcriptomics results in the present study discovered that polymyxin treatment caused significant perturbations in the biosynthesis of lipids, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan, central carbon metabolism, and oxidative stress. Importantly, lipid A modifications were surprisingly rapid in response to polymyxin treatment at clinically relevant concentrations. This is the first study to reveal the dynamics of polymyxin-induced cellular responses at the systems level, which highlights that combination therapy should be considered to minimize resistance to the last-line polymyxins. The results also provide much-needed mechanistic information which potentially benefits the discovery of new-generation polymyxins.

We found evidence that, in comparison with bacteria as a whole, marine organisms have irregular TCS system constructs which might represent an adaptation specific to the marine environment. Additionally, we demonstrate the biogeochemical relevance of TCS systems by correlating the presence of the PMT9312_0717 response regulator protein to phosphate concentrations in the South Pacific.

A possible mechanism for interactions of microbes is through cross-feeding, i.e., the exchange of small molecules.

To systematically explore the space of possible strategies for division of labor, we applied advanced optimization algorithms to computational models of cellular metabolism. Specifically, we searched for communities able to survive under constraints (such as a limited number of reactions) that would not be sustainable by individual species.

            staphylococci (NAS) are the most frequently isolated pathogens from milk in dairy cattle worldwide. The virulence factors (VFs) and mechanisms by which these bacteria cause udder infection are not fully known. We determined the distribution and associations of 191 VFs in 25 NAS species and investigated the relationship between VFs and disease. Although the overall number of VFs was not associated with disease severity, increasing numbers of toxin and host immune evasion genes specifically were associated with more severe disease outcomes. These findings suggest that the development of disease and the interactions of VFs with the host are complex and determined by the interplay of genes rather than just the presence of virulence genes. Together, our results provide foundational genetic knowledge to other researchers to design and conduct further experiments, focusing on understanding the synergy between VFs and roles of individual NAS species in IMI and characterizing species-specific effects on udder health.

            <jats:italic>pmoCAB</jats:italic>
            operon that is under positive selection for optimal resource allocation and efficient synthesis of transcripts and proteins. This adaptive trait possibly enables type Ia methanotrophs to respond robustly to fluctuating methane availability and explains their global prevalence.

Genomics and machine learning methods are being increasingly used to analyze and predict AMR. This type of surveillance is very important to try to reduce the impact of AMR. Machine learning models are typically trained using genomic data, but the aspects of the genomes that they use to make predictions are rarely analyzed.

GUS enzymes, with importance in normal physiology and disease, are an attractive set of proteins to use for such analyses. Here we show that while the specific GUS enzymes differ at the sequence level, a core GUSome functionality appears conserved between mouse and human gastrointestinal bacteria.

Since the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase is extremely sensitive to oxygen, how these surface-dwelling plankton manage the two conflicting processes of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis has been a long-standing question. In this study, we developed a simple model of metabolic fluxes of
            <jats:italic>Trichodesmium</jats:italic>
            capturing observed daily cycles of photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and boundary layer oxygen concentrations. The model suggests that forming a chain of cells for spatially segregating nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis is essential but not sufficient. It also requires a barrier against oxygen diffusion and high rates of oxygen scavenging by respiration. Finally, the model indicates that the life span of intracellular oxygen is extremely short, thus enabling cells to instantly create a low-oxygen environment upon deactivation of photosynthesis.

            Understanding the sources and controls on microbial methane production from wetland soils is critical to global methane emission predictions, particularly in light of changing climatic conditions. Current biogeochemical models of methanogenesis consider only acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic sources and exclude methylotrophic methanogenesis, potentially underestimating microbial contributions to methane flux. Our multi-omic results demonstrated that methylotrophic methanogens of the family

However, laboratory experiments indicated the potential for other methanogens to become enriched in response to trimethylamine, revealing the reservoir of methylotrophic methanogenesis potential residing in these soils. Collectively, our approach used coupled field and laboratory investigations to illuminate metabolisms influencing the terrestrial microbial methane cycle, thereby offering direction for increased realism in predictive process-oriented models of methane flux in wetland soils.

To control MAH by improved therapy, prevention, and diagnostics, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of infection. Here, we provide crucial insights into MAH’s global genetic requirements for growth and infection. We find that the vast majority of genes required for MAH growth and virulence (96% and 97%, respectively) have mutual orthologs in the tuberculosis-causing pathogen
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">M. tuberculosis</jats:named-content>
            (
            <jats:italic>Mtb</jats:italic>
            ). However, we also find growth and virulence genes specific to MAC species. Finally, we validate novel mycobacterial virulence factors that might serve as future drug targets for MAH-specific treatment or translate to broader treatment of related mycobacterial diseases.

We observe that 14% of the identified cellular proteome is remodeled, and several proteins distributed across diverse cellular processes with functions in signaling, cell adhesion, development, and immunity show either higher or lower levels under autophagy-deficient conditions. These cells have lower levels of crucial immune proteins that are required to mount a protective inflammatory response. This study will serve as a valuable resource to determine the role of autophagy in modulating specific protein levels in cells.

These studies have revealed sulfide, pH, and temperature are the main constraints on phototrophy. However, the taxonomic and physiological diversity of anoxygenic phototrophs suggests that, within these constraints, specific geochemical parameters determine the distribution and activity of individual anoxygenic phototrophic taxa. Here, we report the recovery of sequences affiliated with characterized anoxygenic phototrophs in sites that range in pH from 2 to 9 and in temperature from 31°C to 71°C. Transcript abundance indicates anoxygenic phototrophs are active across this temperature and pH range. Our data suggest sulfide is not a key determinant of anoxygenic phototrophic taxa and underscore a role for photoheterotrophy in terrestrial geothermal ecosystems. These data provide the framework for high-resolution sequencing and

            Several previous studies have pointed to environmental chemical exposure during windows of development as a contributing factor in neurodevelopmental disorders and correlated these disorders with microbiota dysbiosis; however, little is known about how the chemicals specifically alter the microbiota to interfere with development. The findings reported in this paper unambiguously establish that a pollutant linked with neurodevelopmental disorders can directly modify the microbiota to promote the production of a potentially toxic metabolite (
            <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>
            -cresol) that has also been correlated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, we used a novel modeling strategy to identify the responsible enzymes and bacterial sources of this metabolite. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to characterize the functional consequence of phthalate exposure on a developed microbiota. Our results suggest that specific bacterial pathways could be developed as diagnostic and therapeutic targets against health risks posed by ingestion of environmental chemicals.

            Viruses are extremely abundant and diverse biological entities that contribute to the functioning of marine ecosystems. Despite their recognized importance, few studies have addressed trends of mutation accumulation in marine viral communities across depth gradients. By investigating these trends, we show that mutation frequencies differ among viral genes according to their molecular functions, with the highest microdiversity occurring among proteins related to host metabolism, followed by structural proteins and, lastly, genome replication proteins. This is in agreement with evolutionary theory that postulates that housekeeping genes are under strong purifying selection. We also observed a positive association between depth and microdiversity. One exception to this trend was the host recognition proteins from the deep chlorophyll maximum, which displayed strikingly high microdiversity, which we hypothesize to be associated with intraspecies competition for hosts. Finally, our data allowed us to propose a theoretical model for viral microdiversity across the depth gradient. These discoveries are of special relevance because many of the viral genomic sequences discovered here were predicted to infect some of the most abundant bacteria in marine ecosystems, such as “

            Nontargeted approaches using metabolomics to analyze metabolites that occur in the oceans is less developed than those for terrestrial and limnic ecosystems.

Building on previous sample preparation methods for metabolomics, we developed SeaMet, which overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. Considering that the oceans contain the largest dissolved organic matter pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome using nontargeted approaches is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO

Here, we evaluate the use of bioreactors supporting defined microbial communities derived from human fecal samples as models of the colonic microbiota in determining the effectiveness of antibiotic pretreatment.

            Bacterial persistence is a fascinating phenomenon in which a small subpopulation of bacteria becomes phenotypically tolerant to lethal antibiotic exposure. There is growing evidence that populations of bacteria in chronic clinical infections develop a hyperpersistent phenotype, enabling a substantially larger subpopulation to survive repeated antibiotic treatment. The mechanisms of persistence and modes of increasing persistence rates remain largely unknown. Here, we utilized experimental evolution to select for
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Escherichia coli</jats:named-content>
            mutants that have more than a thousandfold increase in persistence rates. We discovered that a variety of individual mutations to translation-related processes are causally involved. Furthermore, we found that these mutations lead to population heterogeneity in the expression of specific genes.

This study examined the bacteria and bacterial transcriptome associated with microbes derived from biofilm-positive human cancers that promoted tumorigenesis in a murine model of CRC. The murine response to different microbial communities (derived from CRC patients or healthy people) was evaluated through RNA and microRNA sequencing.

            Bacterial and archaeal flagellins are remarkable in having a shared region with variation in housekeeping proteins and a region with extreme diversity, perhaps greater than for any other protein. Analysis of the 113,285 available full-gene sequences of flagellin genes from published bacterial and archaeal sequences revealed the nature and enormous extent of flagellin diversity. There were 35,898 unique amino acid sequences that were resolved into 187 clusters. Analysis of the

            flagellins revealed that the variation occurs at two levels. The first is the division of the variable regions into sequence forms that are so divergent that there is no meaningful alignment even within species, and these corresponded to the

            Iron oxides are important components of our soil, water supplies, and ecosystems, as they sequester nutrients, carbon, and metals. Microorganisms can form iron oxides, but it is unclear whether this is a significant mechanism in the environment. Unlike other major microbial energy metabolisms, there is no marker gene for iron oxidation, hindering our ability to track these microbes. Here, we investigate a promising possible iron oxidation gene,

            Nitrification is a ubiquitous microbially mediated process in the environment and an essential process in engineered systems such as wastewater and drinking water treatment plants. However, nitrification also contributes to fertilizer loss from agricultural environments, increasing the eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems, and produces the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are the most dominant ammonia-oxidizing microbes in fertilized agricultural soils, understanding their responses to a variety of environmental conditions is essential for curbing the negative environmental effects of nitrification. Notably, oxygen limitation has been reported to significantly increase nitric oxide and nitrous oxide production during nitrification.

            Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to global health, and systematic studies to understand the underlying resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. Although significant progress has been made in deciphering the mechanistic basis of individual resistance determinants, many bacterial species rely on the induction of a whole battery of resistance modules, and the complex regulatory networks controlling these modules in response to antibiotic stress are often poorly understood. In this work we combined experiments and theoretical modeling to decipher the resistance network of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            against bacitracin, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. We found a high level of cross-regulation between the two major resistance modules in response to bacitracin stress and quantified their effects on bacterial resistance. To rationalize our experimental data, we expanded a previously established computational model for the lipid II cycle through incorporating the quantitative action of the resistance modules. This led us to a systems-level description of the bacitracin stress response network that captures the complex interplay between resistance modules and the essential lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis and accurately predicts the minimal inhibitory bacitracin concentration in all the studied mutants. With this, our study highlights how bacterial resistance emerges from an interlaced network of redundant homeostasis and stress response modules.

            The discovery of antibiotics such as penicillin and streptomycin marked a historic milestone in the 1940s and heralded a new era of antimicrobial therapy as the modern standard for medical treatment. Yet, even in those early days of discovery, it was noted that a small subset of cells (∼1 in 10
            <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
            ) survived antibiotic treatment and continued to persist, leading to recurrence of chronic infection. These persisters are phenotypic variants that have modified their physiology to survive environmental stress. In this study, we have performed three transcriptomic screens to identify persistence genes that are common between three different stressor conditions. In particular, we identified genes that function in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, small molecules, and complex lipids, which are likely required to maintain the persistence state. Targeting universal persistence genes can lead to the development of clinically relevant antipersistence therapeutics for infectious disease management.

In a longitudinal study, we showed that a high-fat/high-protein, Atkins-type diet greatly exacerbated antibiotic-induced CDI, whereas a high-carbohydrate diet protected, despite the high monosaccharide and starch content. Our study results, therefore, suggest that popular high-fat/high-protein weight-loss diets may enhance CDI risk during antibiotic treatment, possibly due to the synergistic effects of a loss of the microorganisms that normally inhibit

            Microbial ecologists have historically used cultivation-based approaches as well as amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to characterize microbial diversity in soil. However, challenges persist in the study of microbial diversity, including the recalcitrance of the majority of microorganisms to laboratory cultivation and limited sequence assembly from highly complex samples. The uncultivated majority thus remains a reservoir of untapped genetic diversity. To address some of the challenges associated with bulk metagenomics as well as low throughput of single-cell genomics, we applied flow cytometry-enabled mini-metagenomics to capture expanded microbial diversity from forest soil and compare it to soil bulk metagenomics. Our resulting data from this pooled-cell sorting approach combined with bulk metagenomics revealed increased phylogenetic diversity through novel soil taxa and rare biosphere members.

            is one of the most important threats to plant health worldwide, causing disease in the Americas on a range of agricultural crops and trees, and recently associated with a critical epidemic affecting olive trees in Europe. A main challenge for the detection of the pathogen and the development of physiological studies is its fastidious growth, as the generation time can vary from 10 to 100 h for some strains. This physiological peculiarity is shared with several human pathogens and is poorly understood. We performed an analysis of the metabolic capabilities of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">X. fastidiosa</jats:named-content>
            through a genome-scale metabolic model of the bacterium. This model was reconstructed and manually curated using experiments and bibliographical evidence. Our study revealed that fastidious growth most probably results from different metabolic specificities such as the absence of highly efficient enzymes or a global inefficiency in virulence factor production. These results support the idea that the fragility of the metabolic network may have been shaped during evolution to lead to the self-limiting behavior of

            The microbial decomposition of animal tissues is an important ecological process that impacts nutrient cycling in natural environments. We studied the microbial decomposition of a common North American fish (rainbow darters) over four time points, combining 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequence data to obtain both taxonomic and functional perspectives. Our data revealed a strong community succession that was reproduced across different fish and environments. Decomposition time point was the main driver of community composition and functional potential; fish environmental origin (upstream or downstream of a wastewater treatment plant) had a secondary effect. We also identified strains related to the putative pathogen
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aeromonas veronii</jats:named-content>

Our work reveals a strong decomposer succession in wild-caught fish, providing functional and taxonomic insights into the vertebrate necrobiome.

            As the major facilitators of the turnover of organic matter in the marine environment, the ability of heterotrophic bacteria to acquire specific compounds within the diverse range of dissolved organic matter will affect the regeneration of essential nutrients such as iron and carbon. TonB-dependent transporters are a prevalent cellular tool in Gram-negative bacteria that allow a relatively high-molecular-weight fraction of organic matter to be directly accessed. However, these transporters are not well characterized in marine bacteria, limiting our understanding of the flow of specific substrates through the marine microbial loop. Here, we characterize the TonB-dependent transporters responsible for iron and carbon acquisition in a representative marine copiotroph and examine their distribution across the genus
            <jats:italic>Alteromonas</jats:italic>

            Zinc is crucial for many biological processes, as it is an essential cofactor of enzymes and a structural component of regulatory and DNA binding proteins. Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export.

Here, we found that exoenzymes associated with nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition were strongly correlated with inorganic nutrient levels, while those associated with carbon acquisition depended on the type of organic carbon available. We also show a linear relationship between carbon- and nitrogen-acquiring exoenzymes and a strong correlation between microbial biomass and exoenzymes, highlighting their significance to microbial productivity. Last, we show that changes in microbial community composition are not strongly associated with changes in exoenzyme activity profiles, a finding which reveals a redundancy of exoenzyme activity functions among microbial community.

            Ridge flanks represent the major avenue of chemical and heat exchange between the Earth’s oceans and the lithosphere and are thought to harbor an enormous and understudied biosphere. However, little is known about the diversity and functionality of the crustal biosphere. Here, we report an indigenous community of archaea specialized in ammonia oxidation (i.e., AOA) in the oxic oceanic crust at North Pond. These AOA are the dominant archaea and are likely responsible for most of the cycling taking place in the first step of nitrification, a feasible nitrogen cycling step in the oxic basement. The crustal AOA community structure significantly differs from that in deep ocean water but is similar to that of the community in the overlying sediments in close proximity. This report links the occurrence of AOA to their metabolic activity in the oxic subseafloor crust and suggests that ecological selection and

            Development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis is associated with alterations in intestinal microbiota, including an escalation of dysbiosis and reduced bacterial richness. This study demonstrates that reduced bacterial richness and dysbiosis escalate with the progression of cirrhosis from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis and to HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis). Moreover, we report for the first time the effect of environmental factors on HCC-cirrhosis. Excess weight was associated with increased dysbiosis in patients with HCC compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Moreover, fatty liver, consumption of artificial sweeteners, and high-sugar foods were associated with altered microbial composition, including altered levels of

This combination allowed PCM detection, independently of disease form, through identification of a set of molecules present in patients’ blood.

            Antibiotic resistance has been largely considered a specific bacterial response to an antibiotic challenge. Indeed, its study has been mainly concentrated on mechanisms that affect the antibiotics (mutations in transporters, efflux pumps, and antibiotic-modifying enzymes, or their regulators) or their targets (i.e., target mutations, protection, or bypass). Usually, antibiotic resistance-associated metabolic changes were considered a consequence (fitness costs) and not a cause of antibiotic resistance. Herein, we show that alterations in the central carbon bacterial metabolism can also be the cause of antibiotic resistance. In the study presented here,

            acquires fosfomycin resistance through the inactivation of glycolytic enzymes belonging to the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Besides resistance to fosfomycin, this inactivation also impairs the bacterial gluconeogenic pathway. Together with previous work showing that antibiotic resistance can be under metabolic control, our results provide evidence that antibiotic resistance is intertwined with the bacterial metabolism.

Although antibiotic therapy is a principal treatment for CF lung disease, we have little understanding of how antibiotics affect the CF lung microbiome and metabolome and how much the community changes on daily timescales. By analyzing 594 longitudinal CF sputum samples from six adult subjects, we show that the sputum microbiome and metabolome are dynamic. Significant changes occur during times of stability and also through pulmonary exacerbations (CFPEs). Microbiome alpha-diversity increased as a CFPE developed and then decreased during treatment in a manner corresponding to the reduction in the log ratio of anaerobic bacteria to classic pathogens.

            Bacteriophages are viruses that invade the bacterial host, disrupt bacterial metabolism, and cause the bacterium to lyse. Because of its remarkable antibacterial activity and unique advantages over antibiotics, for instance, bacteriophage is specific for one species of bacteria and resistance to phage is less common than resistance to antibiotics. Indeed, bacteriophage therapy for treating infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in humans has become a research hot spot. However, it is also worth considering that bacteriophages are transferable and could cotransfer host chromosomal genes, e.g., virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, while lysogenizing and integrating into the bacterial chromosome (prophage), thus playing a role in bacterial evolution and virulence. In the current study, we identified a novel prophage, ϕSA169, from a clinical persistent MRSA bacteremia isolate, and we determined that ϕSA169 mediated well-defined

There are increasing reports of polymyxin resistance emerging, raising concerns of a postantibiotic era. Polymyxin resistance is therefore a significant public health threat, but current phenotypic methods for detection are difficult and time-consuming to perform. There have been increasing efforts to use whole-genome sequencing for detection of antibiotic resistance, but this has been difficult to apply to polymyxin resistance because of its complex polygenic nature.

            Individual bacterial genomes can have dozens of small noncoding RNAs with largely unexplored regulatory functions. Although bacterial sRNAs influence a wide range of biological processes, including antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity, our current understanding of sRNA-mediated regulation is far from complete. Most of the available information is restricted to a few well-studied bacterial species; and even in those species, only partial sets of sRNA targets have been characterized in detail. To close this information gap, we developed a computational strategy that takes advantage of available transcriptional data and knowledge about validated and putative sRNA-mRNA interactions for inferring expanded sRNA regulons. Our approach facilitates the identification of experimentally supported novel interactions while filtering out false-positive results. Due to its data-driven nature, our method prioritizes biologically relevant interactions among lists of candidate sRNA-target pairs predicted

By characterizing the transcriptional profile of cells in long-term stationary phase, a heterogenous and stressful environment, we can begin to understand how cells physiologically and biochemically react to the laboratory environment, and how this compares to more-natural conditions.</jats:p>",en,mSystems,,,,,,,NA,NA,,10.1128_msystems.00364-20,Data/html/10.1128_msystems.00364-20

            Gene duplication events have been related with increasing biological complexity through the tree of life, but also with illnesses, including cancer. Early evolutionary theories indicated that duplicated genes could explore alternative functions due to relaxation of selective constraints in one of the copies, as the other remains as ancestral-function backup. In unicellular eukaryotes like yeasts, it has been demonstrated that the fate and persistence of duplicates depend on duplication mechanism (whole-genome or small-scale events), shaping their actual genomes. Although it has been shown that small-scale duplicates tend to innovate and whole-genome duplicates specialize in ancestral functions, the implication of duplicates’ transcriptional plasticity and transcriptional divergence on environmental and metabolic responses remains largely obscure. Here, by experimental adaptive evolution, we show that
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:named-content>

These duplicates respond by transcriptional rewiring, depending on their transcriptional background. Our results shed light on the mechanisms that determine the role of duplicates, and on their evolvability.

            Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection and progressive lung disease. Studies of cystic fibrosis lung microbiology often rely on expectorated sputum to reflect the microbiota present in the lower airways. Passage of sputum through the oropharynx during collection, however, contributes microbes present in saliva to the sample, which could confound interpretation of results.

The results of this study help fill this critical knowledge gap and provide valuable insight into how oil spill response efforts, such as chemically dispersing oil, may have differing effects in neighboring coastal and offshore marine environments.</jats:p>",en,mSystems,,,,,,,NA,NA,,10.1128_msystems.00668-20,Data/html/10.1128_msystems.00668-20

            Globally, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women. BV is associated with poorer reproductive health outcomes and HIV risk. Typically, BV represents a shift in the vaginal microbiome from one that is dominated by
            <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>
            to one that is diverse. Despite many women having similar exposures, the prevalence of BV and nonoptimal vaginal microbiome is increased for women of African descent, suggesting a possible role for host genetics. We conducted a genome-wide association study of important vaginal microbiome traits in Kenyan women. We identified novel genetic loci and biological pathways related to mucosal immunity, cell signaling, and infection that were associated with vaginal microbiome traits; we replicated previously reported loci associated with mucosal immune response. These results provide insight into potential host genetic influences on vaginal microbiome composition and can guide larger longitudinal studies, with genetic and functional comparison across microbiome sites within individuals and across populations.

The bee gut microbiota is acquired early in adult life and can be compromised by antibiotics and other chemicals. The globally used weed killer glyphosate was previously found to impact the gut microbiota of honey bees following sustained exposure. In the present study, we address how this impact depends on concentration, duration of exposure, and stage of community establishment. We found that sublethal doses of glyphosate reduce the abundance of beneficial bacteria and affect microbial diversity in the guts of honey bees, regardless of whether exposure occurs during or after microbiota acquisition. We also compared the effects of glyphosate to those of tylosin, an antibiotic used in beekeeping, and observed that tylosin effects diverge from those caused by glyphosate and are greater during microbiota acquisition.

            Self-organization into spatial patterns is evident in many multicellular phenomena. Even for the best-studied systems, our ability to dissect the mechanisms driving coordinated cell movement is limited. While genetic approaches can identify mutations perturbing multicellular patterns, the diverse nature of the signaling cues coupled to significant heterogeneity of individual cell behavior impedes our ability to mechanistically connect genes with phenotype. Small differences in the behaviors of mutant strains could be irrelevant or could sometimes lead to large differences in the emergent patterns.

            To engage with host cells, diverse pathogenic bacteria produce syringe-like structures called contractile injection systems (CIS). CIS are evolutionarily related to the contractile tails of bacteriophages and are specialized to puncture membranes, often delivering effectors to target cells. Although CIS are key for pathogens to cause disease, paradoxically, similar injection systems have been identified within healthy human microbiome bacteria. Here, we show that gene clusters encoding a predicted CIS, which we term

            COVID-19 is caused by the highly contagious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and currently has detrimental human health, community, and economic impacts around the world. It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, which can be fatal, while others only develop mild symptoms. In the absence of an effective and widely available vaccine, it is of paramount importance that we identify risk factors for development of severe symptoms to be able to improve treatment approaches. The
            <jats:italic>ACE2</jats:italic>
            gene encodes the receptor on human cells that the virus uses to infect these cells. This study finds that if the lungs of healthy individuals have high levels of ACE2, they typically have low levels of the immune cells that eliminate viruses. Therefore, some individuals may develop severe COVID-19 due to simultaneous high levels of the virus receptor and low levels of immune cells that eradicate the virus in their lungs.

By developing and testing mathematical models to discriminate between two competing hypotheses for the nature of the signal controlling RB-to-EB cell type switching, we demonstrate that RB-to-EB development follows a cell-autonomous program that does not respond to environmental cues. Additionally, we show that RB-to-EB development is a function of chlamydial growth and division. This study serves to further our understanding of the chlamydial developmental cycle that is central to the bacterium’s pathogenesis.

            The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic has led to a global slowdown with far-reaching financial and social impacts. The SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus is primarily transmitted from person to person through inhalation of infected droplets or aerosols. However, some studies have shown that virions can remain infectious on surfaces for days and can lead to human infection from contact with infected surfaces. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end study showed that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm

Gaining a greater understanding of the transmission dynamics of IAV is important during seasonal IAV epidemics and in the event of a pandemic. Direct bacterium-virus interactions are a recently appreciated aspect of infectious disease biology. Direct interactions between IAV and specific bacterial species of the human upper respiratory tract were found to promote the stability and infectivity of IAV during desiccation stress. Viral environmental stability is an important aspect during transmission, suggesting a potential role for bacterial respiratory communities in IAV transmission.

The derivative technology, base editing, combines the catalytically inactivated Cas nuclease and nucleotide deaminase and mediates the genetic modifications at single-nucleotide precision without introducing a DSB. Moreover, the cytosine base editors (CBEs) are able to transform multiple codons into stop codons, rapidly inactivating a gene of interest and enabling loss-of-function study in some recombination-deficient species.

            is one of the few tractable model magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) for studying magnetosome biomineralization. So far, knowledge on the genetic determinants of this complex process has been mainly gathered using reverse genetics and candidate approaches. In contrast, nontargeted forward genetics studies are lacking, since application of such techniques in MTB has been complicated for a number of technical reasons. Here, we report on the first comprehensive transposon mutagenesis study in MTB, aiming at systematic identification of auxiliary genes necessary to support magnetosome formation in addition to key genes harbored in the magnetosome island (MAI). Our work considerably extends the candidate set of novel subsidiary determinants and shows that the full gene complement underlying magnetosome biosynthesis is larger than assumed. In particular, we were able to define certain cellular pathways as specifically important for magnetosome formation that have not been implicated in this process so far.

Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the transcriptional regulation of TCSs to infer bacterial environmental adaptation and disease pathogenicity. Utilizing a combinatorial approach integrating RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), independent component analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with exonuclease treatment (ChIP-exo), and data mining, we suggest five different modes of TCS transcriptional regulation.

A large amount of evidence now suggests that a balanced intestinal microecology is considered an important part of health. Our results show that α-linolenic acid administration significantly improved the host metabolic phenotype and gut microbiota of mice fed a high-fat diet, and there was a correlation between the improved gut microbiota and metabolic phenotype. Some specific bacteria may play a unique regulatory role. Here, we have established correlation networks between gut microbiota and multitissue homeostasis, which may provide a new basis for further elucidating the relationship between the gut microbiota and host metabolism.

            <jats:p>With the currently available antibiotics, the treatment of TB takes months. The slow response to treatment is caused by antibiotic tolerance, which is especially common among bacteria that form biofilms. Such biofilms are composed of bacterial cells surrounded by the extracellular matrix. Both the matrix and the dormant lifestyle of the bacterial cells are thought to hinder the efficacy of antibiotics. To be able to develop faster-acting treatments against TB, the biofilm forms of mycobacteria deserve specific attention. In this work, we characterize the protein composition of Mmr biofilms in bacterial cultures and in mycobacteria extracted from infected adult zebrafish. We identify abundant surface-exposed targets and develop the first sybodies that bind to mycobacterial biofilms. As nanobodies can be linked to other therapeutic compounds, in the future, they can provide means to target therapies to biofilms.</jats:p>

In contrast, archaeal communities show approximately equal frequencies of positive and negative correlations in individual data sets, and a positive pan-environmental correlation for archaea only emerges after limiting the analysis to samples with reported oxygen concentrations.

            Epidemiological surveys have shown that carbapenem resistance is mainly transmitted across species by carbapenemase genes located on conjugative plasmids. As chromosomal integration of carbapenemase genes has rarely been identified, only a few studies have investigated their advantages to the carbapenem-resistant bacterial community. Here, we confirmed the increased stability of
            <jats:italic>bla</jats:italic>
            <jats:sub>IMP-6</jats:sub>
            on a chromosome-integrated plasmid in an
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            isolate compared with that on original plasmids in the absence of antibiotic pressure. Although plasmids carrying carbapenemase genes are supposedly lost in successive generations, we found that the complete plasmid backbone was retained in bacterial cells even after the occasional loss of their antibiotic-resistance cassettes. This backbone structure has been observed worldwide to carry various antimicrobial resistance genes. Although the chromosomally integrated plasmid carrying
            <jats:italic>bla</jats:italic>
            <jats:sub>IMP-6</jats:sub>
            could not be transmitted by conjugation, we found that meropenem treatment for 1 wk allowed the plasmid to be released from the chromosome and spread among
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            strains that were susceptible to meropenem. The copy number of

            on the plasmid was amplified eight times, resulting in enhanced resistance. Although the carbapenemase producers that carry chromosomal carbapenemase genes comprised of small subpopulations, they functioned as stable, long-term reservoirs of carbapenem resistance that could be disseminated via plasmids with amplified resistance upon meropenem stimulation. Although plasmids occasionally lose their resistance cassettes as a scaffold for the acquisition of another resistance gene, chromosomal integration may contribute to the effective sharing of carbapenem resistance within a population, complicating the development of a strategy to avoid the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.

              <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic>
              (CRE) threatens public health. Carbapenemases, which are enzymes responsible for carbapenem resistance, are mainly encoded by genes on plasmids that can be transmitted across bacterial species. Owing to the rarity of chromosomally encoded carbapenemase genes, studies investigating their properties in bacterial communities are lacking. In our study, we revealed the stability of carbapenemase genes on chromosomes compared with those on plasmids, which can be lost through the loss of antimicrobial resistance cassettes despite robust retention of plasmid backbones. Following exposure to meropenem, the carbapenemase gene integrated into the chromosome was released as a plasmid, restarting the dissemination of enhanced carbapenem resistance through amplified copy numbers of carbapenemase genes. Chromosomally encoded carbapenemase genes may function as a reservoir of resistance genes within the bacterial community and challenge infection control against CRE dissemination.

            We conducted UPLC-MS-based metabolomics, 16S rRNA, and metagenome sequencing on the fecal samples of 44 captive giant pandas (
            <jats:italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</jats:italic>
            ) from four age groups (i.e., Cub, Young, Adult, and Old) to comprehensively understand age-related changes in the metabolism and gut microbiota of giant pandas. We characterized the metabolite profiles of giant pandas based on 1,376 identified metabolites, with 152 significantly differential metabolites (SDMs) found across the age groups. We found that the metabolites and the composition/function of the gut microbiota changed in response to the transition from a milk-dominant diet in panda cubs to a bamboo-specific diet in young and adult pandas. Lipid metabolites such as choline and hippuric acid were enriched in the Cub group, and many plant secondary metabolites were significantly higher in the Young and Adult groups, while oxidative stress and inflammatory related metabolites were only found in the Old group. However, there was a decrease in the α-diversity of gut microbiota in adult and old pandas, who exclusively consume bamboo. The abundance of bacteria related to the digestion of cellulose-rich food, such as Firmicutes,
            <jats:italic>Streptococcus,</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Clostridium,</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Sarcina,</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Blautia</jats:italic>
            significantly decreased. Notably, several potential pathogenic bacteria had relatively high abundances, especially in the Young group. Metagenomic analysis identified 277 CAZyme genes including cellulose degrading genes, and seven of the CAZymes had abundances that significantly differed between age groups. We also identified 237 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) whose number and diversity increased with age. We also found a significant positive correlation between the abundance of bile acids and gut bacteria, especially
            <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>

This study conducted UPLC-MS-based metabolomics 16S rRNA, and metagenome sequencing on the fecal samples of captive giant pandas from four age groups.

            Bathyarchaeota, known as key participants of global elements cycling, is highly abundant and diverse in the sedimentary environments. Bathyarchaeota has been the research spotlight on sedimentary microbiology; however, its distribution in arable soils is far from understanding. Paddy soil is a habitat similar to freshwater sediments, while the distribution and composition of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils have largely been overlooked. In this study, we collected 342
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            paddy soil sequencing data worldwide to illuminate the distribution patterns of Bathyarchaeota and explore their potential ecological functions in paddy soils. The results showed that Bathyarchaeota is the dominant archaeal lineage, and Bathy-6 is the most predominant subgroup in paddy soils. Based on random forest analysis and construction of a multivariate regression tree, the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are identified as the factors significantly influencing the abundance and composition of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils. Bathy-6 was abundant in temperate environments, while other subgroups were more abundant in sites with higher rainfall. There are highly frequent associations between Bathyarchaeota and methanogens and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. The interactions between Bathyarchaeota and microorganisms involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism imply a potential syntrophy between these microorganisms, suggesting that members of Bathyarchaeota could be important participants of geochemical cycle in paddy soils. These results shed light on the ecological lifestyle of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils, and provide some baseline for further understanding Bathyarchaeota in arable soils.

            <jats:p>Bathyarchaeota, the dominant archaeal lineage in sedimentary environments, has been the spotlight of microbial research due to its vital role in carbon cycling. Although Bathyarchaeota has been also detected in paddy soils worldwide, its distribution in this environment has not yet been investigated. In this study, we conducted a global scale meta-analysis and found that Bathyarchaeota is also the dominant archaeal lineage in paddy soils with significant regional abundance differences. Bathy-6 is the most predominant subgroup in paddy soils, which differs from sediments. Furthermore, Bathyarchaeota are highly associated with methanogens and ammonia-oxidizing archaea, suggesting that they may be involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycle in paddy soil. These interactions provide insight into the ecological functions of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils, which will be the foundation of future studies regarding the geochemical cycle in arable soils and global climate change.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Progress in molecular methods has enabled the monitoring of bacterial populations in time. Nevertheless, understanding community dynamics and its links with ecosystem functioning remains challenging due to the tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Conceptual frameworks that make sense of time series of taxonomically rich bacterial communities, regarding their potential ecological function, are needed. A key concept for organizing ecological functions is the niche, the set of strategies that enable a population to persist and define its impacts on the surroundings. Here we present a framework based on manifold learning to organize genomic information into potentially occupied bacterial metabolic niches over time. Manifold learning tries to uncover low-dimensional data structures in high-dimensional data sets that can be used to describe the data in reduced dimensions. We apply the method to re-construct the dynamics of putatively occupied metabolic niches using a long-term bacterial time series from the Baltic Sea, the Linnaeus Microbial Observatory (LMO). The results reveal a relatively low-dimensional space of occupied metabolic niches comprising groups of taxa with similar functional capabilities. Time patterns of occupied niches were strongly driven by seasonality. Some metabolic niches were dominated by one bacterial taxon, whereas others were occupied by multiple taxa, depending on the season. These results illustrate the power of manifold learning approaches to advance our understanding of the links between community composition and functioning in microbial systems.</jats:p>

Here, we show that a manifold learning approach can coarse grain bacterial communities in terms of their metabolic strategies and that we can thereby quantitatively organize genomic information in terms of potentially occupied niches over time. This approach, therefore, advances our understanding of how fluctuations in bacterial abundances and species composition can relate to ecosystem functions and it can facilitate the analysis, monitoring, and future predictions of the development of microbial communities.</jats:p>

            The interactions between soil microbiomes at various trophic levels are essential for restoring soil functions. Legumes are considered as “pioneer crops” in degraded or contaminated soils because they can fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobacteria, which promotes soil fertility. However, little is known about the abilities of legumes to contribute to the health of soil contaminated with cadmium (Cd). In this research, we applied a soil amendment (commercial Mg–Ca–Si conditioner, CMC) at two rates (1,500 and 3,000 kg/ha) in a Cd-contaminated soybean field. Bulk and rhizosphere soil samples were collected to assess the amendment-induced effects on four microbial lineages (bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], and nematodes) and their functions including Cd stabilization, nutrient cycling, and pathogen control. Compared with the control, both CMC application rates increased the pH and reduced labile Cd fraction in the bulk and rhizosphere soils. Although the total Cd concentrations in the soil were similar, the Cd accumulation in the grains was significantly reduced in treatments of soil amendments. It was observed that the application of CMC can significantly reduce the AMF diversity but increased the diversity of the other three communities. Moreover, the biodiversity within keystone modules (identified by co-occurrence network analysis) played key roles in driving soil multifunctionality. Specifically, key beneficial groups in module 2 such as
            <jats:italic>Aggregicoccus</jats:italic>
            (bacteria), Sordariomycetes (fungi),
            <jats:italic>Glomus</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Bursaphelenchus</jats:italic>
            (nematode) were strongly associated with soil multifunctionality. By co-culturing bacterial suspensions with the soybean root rot pathogen

            in the

Also, the bacterial community was more resistant to Cd stress in soils receiving CMC amendment. Our findings provide valuable theoretical references for enhancing soil functions and health via applying a soil amendment (CMC) during Cd-contaminated soil remediation.

            Biotic factors that influence the temporal stability of microbial community functioning are an emerging research focus for the control of natural and engineered systems. The discovery of common features within community ensembles that differ in functional stability over time is a starting point to explore biotic factors. We serially propagated a suite of soil microbial communities through five generations of 28-day microcosm incubations to examine microbial community compositional and functional stability during plant litter decomposition. Using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) abundance as a target function, we hypothesized that microbial diversity, compositional stability, and associated changes in interactions would explain the
            <jats:italic>relative</jats:italic>
            stability of the ecosystem function between generations. Communities with initially high DOC abundance tended to converge towards a “low DOC” phenotype within two generations, but across all microcosms, functional stability between generations was highly variable. By splitting communities into two cohorts based on their relative DOC functional stability, we found that compositional shifts, diversity, and interaction network complexity were associated with the stability of DOC abundance between generations. Further, our results showed that legacy effects were important in determining compositional and functional outcomes, and we identified taxa associated with high DOC abundance. In the context of litter decomposition, achieving functionally stable communities is required to utilize soil microbiomes to increase DOC abundance and long-term terrestrial DOC sequestration as one solution to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Identifying factors that stabilize function for a community of interest may improve the success of microbiome engineering applications.

Identifying and understanding biotic factors that control functional stability is of significant interest for natural and engineered communities alike. Using plant litter–decomposing communities as a model system, this study examined the stability of ecosystem function over time following repeated community transfers. By identifying microbial community features that are associated with stable ecosystem functions, microbial communities can be manipulated in ways that promote the consistency and reliability of the desired function, improving outcomes and increasing the utility of microorganisms.</jats:p>

            Bacterioplankton of the SAR11 clade are the most abundant marine microorganisms and consist of numerous subclades spanning order-level divergence (

            is highly controversial, with multiple recent phylogenetic studies placing them completely separate from SAR11. Other than through phylogenomics, subclade V has not received detailed examination due to limited genomes from this group. Here, we assessed the ecogenomic characteristics of subclade V to better understand the role of this group in comparison to the
            <jats:italic>Pelagibacterales</jats:italic>
            . We used a new isolate genome, recently released single-amplified genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes, and previously established SAR11 genomes to perform a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis. We paired this analysis with the recruitment of metagenomes spanning the open ocean, coastal, and brackish systems. Phylogenomics, average amino acid identity, and 16S rRNA gene phylogeny indicate that SAR11 subclade V is synonymous with the ubiquitous AEGEAN-169 clade and support the contention that this group represents a taxonomic family. AEGEAN-169 shared many bulk genome qualities with SAR11, such as streamlining and low GC content, but genomes were generally larger. AEGEAN-169 had overlapping distributions with SAR11 but was metabolically distinct from SAR11 in its potential to transport and utilize a broader range of sugars as well as in the transport of trace metals and thiamin. Thus, regardless of the ultimate phylogenetic placement of AEGEAN-169, these organisms have distinct metabolic capacities that likely allow them to differentiate their niche from canonical SAR11 taxa.

            <jats:p>One goal of marine microbiologists is to uncover the roles various microorganisms are playing in biogeochemical cycles. Success in this endeavor relies on differentiating groups of microbes and circumscribing their relationships. An early-diverging group (subclade V) of the most abundant bacterioplankton, SAR11, has recently been proposed as a separate lineage that does not share a most recent common ancestor. But beyond phylogenetics, little has been done to evaluate how these organisms compare with SAR11. Our work leverages dozens of new genomes to demonstrate the similarities and differences between subclade V and SAR11. In our analysis, we also establish that subclade V is synonymous with a group of bacteria established from 16S rRNA gene sequences, AEGEAN-169. Subclade V/AEGEAN-169 has clear metabolic distinctions from SAR11 and their shared traits point to remarkable convergent evolution if they do not share a most recent common ancestor.</jats:p>

            Microbial polyketide synthase (PKS) genes encode the biosynthesis of many biomedically or otherwise commercially important natural products. Despite extensive discovery efforts, metagenomic analyses suggest that only a small fraction of nature’s polyketide biosynthetic potential has been realized. Much of this potential originates from type I PKSs (T1PKSs), which can be further delineated based on their domain organization and the structural features of the compounds they encode. Notably, phylogenetic relationships among ketosynthase (KS) domains provide an effective method to classify the larger and more complex T1PKS genes in which they occur. Increased access to large metagenomic data sets from diverse habitats provides opportunities to assess T1PKS biosynthetic diversity and distributions through their smaller and more tractable KS domain sequences. Here, we used the web tool NaPDoS2 to detect and classify over 35,000 type I KS domains from 137 metagenomic data sets reported from eight diverse, globally distributed biomes. We found biome-specific separation with soils enriched in KSs from modular

These KSs were phylogenetically distinct from those associated with experimentally characterized PKSs suggesting they may be associated with novel structures or enzyme functions. Finally, we employed our metagenome-extracted KS domains to evaluate the PCR primers commonly used to amplify type I KSs and identified modifications that could increase the KS sequence diversity recovered from amplicon libraries.

Advances in our understanding of polyketide biosynthesis, coupled with the increased availability of metagenomic sequence data, provide new opportunities to assess polyketide biosynthetic potential across biomes.

We show that biomes are differentially enriched in type I KS domains, providing a roadmap for future biodiscovery strategies. Furthermore, KS phylogenies reveal biome-specific clades that do not include biochemically characterized PKSs, highlighting the biosynthetic potential of poorly explored environments. The large metagenome-derived KS data set allowed us to identify regions of commonly used type I KS PCR primers that could be modified to capture a larger extent of environmental KS diversity.

We here show that NaCl concentration constitutes a major regulatory signal that shapes the transcriptome and uncover 1,808 differentially expressed genes (888 upregulated and 920 downregulated in response to low-salt conditions). Growth at 3% NaCl, a salinity that mimics the free-living lifestyle, upregulated genes involved in energy production, nitrogen metabolism, transport of compatible solutes, utilization of trehalose and fructose, and carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism with strong upregulation of the arginine deiminase system (ADS). In addition, we observed a marked increase in resistance to antibiotics at 3% NaCl. On the contrary, the low salinity conditions (1% NaCl) that mimic those encountered in the host triggered a virulence gene expression profile that maximized the production of the type 2 secretion system (T2SS)-dependent cytotoxins damselysin, phobalysin P, and a putative PirAB-like toxin, observations that were corroborated by the analysis of the secretome. Low salinity also upregulated the expression of iron-acquisition systems, efflux pumps, and other functions related to stress response and virulence. The results of this study greatly expand our knowledge of the salinity-responsive adaptations of a generalist and versatile marine pathogen.

            Microbial activity in Arctic soils controls the cycling of significant stores of organic carbon and nutrients. We studied
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            processes in Alaskan soils using original metaproteomic methods in order to relate important heterotrophic functions to microbial taxa and to understand the microbial response to Arctic greening. Major bacterial groups show strong metabolic specialization in organic topsoils. α-/β-/γ-Proteobacteria specialized in the acquisition of small, soluble compounds, whereas Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and other detritosphere groups specialized in the degradation of plant-derived polymers. α-/β-/γ-Proteobacteria dominated the expression of transporters for common root exudates and limiting nitrogenous compounds, supporting an ecological model of dependence upon plants for carbon and competition with plants for nitrogen. Detritosphere groups specialized in distinct substrates, with Acidobacteria producing the most enzymes for hemicellulose depolymerization. Acidobacteria was the most active group across the three plant ecotypes sampled—the largely nonvascular, lower biomass intertussock and the largely vascular, higher biomass tussock and shrub. Functional partitioning among bacterial groups was stable between plant ecotypes, but certain functions associated with α-/β-/γ-Proteobacteria were more strongly expressed in higher biomass ecotypes. We show that refined metaproteomic approaches can elucidate soil microbial ecology as well as biogeochemical trajectories of major carbon stocks.

            <jats:p>The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and Arctic soils currently store twice as much carbon as the entire atmosphere—two facts that make understanding how Arctic soil microbial communities are responding to climate change particularly urgent. Greening of vegetation cover across the Arctic landscape is one of the most prominent climate-driven shifts in Arctic terrestrial ecology, with potentially profound effects on biogeochemical cycling by the soil microbiome. Here we use metaproteomics to document microbial metabolic functions that drive soil carbon and nutrient cycling processes in an Arctic tundra landscape. We identify functional roles among bacterial taxonomic groups that are largely stable across vegetation types, with certain functions strongly expressed by rhizosphere groups reflecting a community metabolic response to greening.</jats:p>

              C1 substrates continue to attract interest in biotechnology, as their use is both cost-effective and ultimately expected to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. However, our current understanding of bacterial C1 metabolism remains relatively limited in species that cannot grow on (i.e., assimilate) these substrates.
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas putida</jats:italic>
              , a model Gram-negative environmental bacterium, constitutes a prime example of this sort. The biochemical pathways active in response to methanol, formaldehyde, and formate have been largely overlooked—although the ability of
              <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic>
              to process C1 molecules has been previously alluded to in the literature. By using a systems-level strategy, this study bridges such knowledge gap through the identification and characterization of mechanisms underlying methanol, formaldehyde, and formate detoxification—including hitherto unknown enzymes that act on these substrates. The results reported herein both expand our understanding of microbial metabolism and lay a solid foundation for engineering efforts toward valorizing C1 feedstocks.

We used FISH-based image cytometry in combination with dilution culture experiments to study net growth, cell division, and mortality rates of four bacterial taxa over two distinct phytoplankton blooms: the oligotrophs SAR11 and SAR86, and the copiotrophic phylum

            <jats:italic>Aurantivirga</jats:italic>
            of up to 1.9/day differed, as expected for oligotrophs and copiotrophs. Surprisingly, SAR11 also reached high cell division rates of up to 1.9/day, even before the onset of phytoplankton blooms. For all four taxonomic groups, the abundance-derived net growth (−0.6 to 0.5/day) was about an order of magnitude lower than the cell division rates. Consequently, mortality rates were comparably high to cell division rates, indicating that about 90% of bacterial production is recycled without apparent time lag within 1 day. Our study shows that determining taxon-specific cell division rates complements omics-based tools and provides unprecedented clues on individual bacterial growth strategies including bottom–up and top–down controls.

However, this does not take cell division and mortality rates into account, which are important for deriving ecological processes like bottom–up and top–down control.

Unexpectedly, SAR11 showed high cell division rates days before the bloom while cell abundances remained constant, which is indicative of strong top–down control. Microscopy remains the method of choice to understand ecological processes like top–down and bottom–up control on a cellular level.

Although they are members of the proteorhodopsin protein family, they form a separate clade within that family and are quite divergent from known proton-pumping proteorhodopsins. They contain either DTT, DTL, or DNI motifs in their key functional amino acids. FArhodopsins are mainly associated with the lower layers of the epipelagic zone. All marine FArhodopsins had the retinal binding lysine, but we found relatives in freshwater metagenomes lacking this key amino acid. AlphaFold predictions of marine FArhodopsins indicate that their retinal pocket might be very reduced or absent, hinting that they are retinal-less. Freshwater FArhodopsins were more diverse than marine ones, but we could not determine if there were other rhodopsins in the genome due to the lack of SAGs or isolates. Although the function of FArhodopsins could not be established, their conserved genomic context indicated involvement in the formation of membrane microdomains. The conservation of FArhodopsins in diverse and globally abundant microorganisms suggests that they may be important in the adaptation to the twilight zone of aquatic environments.

            Plant-associated microbial assemblages are known to shift at time scales aligned with plant phenology, as influenced by the changes in plant-derived nutrient concentrations and abiotic conditions observed over a growing season. But these same factors can change dramatically in a sub-24-hour period, and it is poorly understood how such diel cycling may influence plant-associated microbiomes. Plants respond to the change from day to night via mechanisms collectively referred to as the internal “clock,” and clock phenotypes are associated with shifts in rhizosphere exudates and other changes that we hypothesize could affect rhizosphere microbes. The mustard
            <jats:italic>Boechera stricta</jats:italic>
            has wild populations that contain multiple clock phenotypes of either a 21- or a 24-hour cycle. We grew plants of both phenotypes (two genotypes per phenotype) in incubators that simulated natural diel cycling or that maintained constant light and temperature. Under both cycling and constant conditions, the extracted DNA concentration and the composition of rhizosphere microbial assemblages differed between time points, with daytime DNA concentrations often triple what were observed at night and microbial community composition differing by, for instance, up to 17%. While we found that plants of different genotypes were associated with variation in rhizosphere assemblages, we did not see an effect on soil conditioned by a particular host plant circadian phenotype on subsequent generations of plants. Our results suggest that rhizosphere microbiomes are dynamic at sub-24-hour periods, and those dynamics are shaped by diel cycling in host plant phenotype.

            To alter microbial community composition for therapeutic purposes, an accurate and reliable modeling framework capable of predicting microbial community outcomes is required. Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations have been utilized to describe a breadth of microbial communities, yet, the conditions in which this modeling framework is successful remain unclear. Here, we propose that a set of simple
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            experiments—growing each member in cell-free spent medium obtained from other members—can be used as a test to decide whether an LV model is appropriate for describing microbial interactions of interest. We show that for LV to be a good candidate, the ratio of growth rate to carrying capacity of each isolate when grown in the cell-free spent media of other isolates should remain constant. Using an
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            community of human nasal bacteria as a tractable system, we find that LV can be a good approximation when the environment is low-nutrient (i.e., when growth is limited by the availability of nutrients) and complex (i.e., when multiple resources, rather than a few, determine growth). These findings can help clarify the range of applicability of LV models and reveal when a more complex model may be necessary for predictive modeling of microbial communities.

This study comprehensively investigated the global assembly mechanisms of microbial communities and effects of community-internal influencing factors using the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) data set. We found that deterministic and stochastic processes contribute approximately equally to global microbial community assembly, and, specifically, deterministic processes generally play a major role in free-living and plant-associated (but not plant corpus) environments, while stochastic processes are the major contributor in animal-associated environments. In contrast with the assembly of microorganisms, the assembly of functional genes, predicted from PICRUSt, is mainly attributed to deterministic processes in all microbial communities. The sink and source microbial communities are normally assembled using similar mechanisms, and the core microorganisms are specific to different environment types. On a global scale, deterministic processes are positively related to the community alpha diversity, microbial interaction degree and bacterial predatory-specific gene abundance. Our analysis provides a panoramic picture and regularities of global and environment-typical microbial community assemblies.</jats:p>

A hallmark of (+)ssRNA (positive single-stranded RNA) viruses is the ability to remodel host endomembranes for their own replication. However, the subcellular interplay between RNA viruses and host organelles that harbor gene expression systems, such as mitochondria, is complex and poorly understood.

This study expands the known diversity of mitochondrial viruses and provides additional evidence that they co-opt mitochondrial biology for their survival.

            Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAs can be 5′-capped by the metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Nudix hydrolases, such as bacterial NudC, specifically remove NAD-caps; however, the molecular and cellular functions of these epitranscriptomic modulators remain elusive. Here, we discuss the roles of NudC under stress conditions and the effects of extracellular cues on the NAD epitranscriptome. Our proteome-wide analysis detected the proteins associated with the RNA degradosome as well as ribosomes and stress-responsive proteins in a NudC interactome. Moreover, we confirmed the physical association of NudC with the cold shock DEAD-box RNA helicase CsdA and the RNA chaperone Hfq. Interestingly, knocking out

Mass spectrometry analysis also revealed the drastic up-regulation of 5′-NAD-RNA in response to cold. Furthermore, the inactivation of NudC in bacteria changes the levels of sRNA and protein-coding transcripts associated with bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly pathways. We experimentally demonstrate that the decapping hydrolase NudC suppresses the flagellar movement, while CsdA stimulates it. Thus, the interplay between NudC and CsdA regulates bacterial mobility and coordinates stress-avoidance behavior.

RpoS levels rise continuously after exposure to stress, and the consequences of changing levels of RpoS for the temporal patterns of expression of RpoS-regulated genes have not been described. We measured RpoS levels at various times during the entry to stationary phase, or in response to high osmolarity or low temperature, and found that the time required to reach maximum levels varied by several hours. We quantified the transcriptome across these stresses using RNA-seq. The number of differentially expressed genes differed among stresses, with 1,379 DE genes identified in stationary phase, 633 in high osmolarity, and 302 in cold shock. To quantify the timing of gene expression, we fit sigmoid or double sigmoid models to differentially expressed genes in each stress.

            <jats:p>The development of probiotic therapies targeted at the small intestinal microbiota represents a significant advancement in the field of probiotic interventions. This region poses unique opportunities due to its low number of gut microbiota, along with the presence of heightened immune and metabolic host responses. However, progress in this area has been hindered by a lack of detailed understanding regarding the molecular mechanisms through which probiotics exert their effects in the small intestine. Our study, utilizing a synthetic community of three small intestinal bacterial strains and the addition of two different probiotic species, and kynurenine as a representative dietary or endogenously produced compound, highlights the importance of selecting probiotic species with diverse genetic capabilities that complement the functional capacity of the resident microbiota, or alternatively, constructing a multispecies formula. This approach holds great promise for the development of effective probiotic therapies and underscores the need to consider the functional capacity of probiotic species when designing interventions.</jats:p>

            Although gut microbiota alteration and related blood microbe profiles in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are associated with the disease progression, how abnormal blood microbe profiles influence the inflammation and immune restoration are not fully understood. To address these issues, this study enrolled 24 healthy controls (HCs) and 91 HIV-infected individuals, including 30 treatment-naïve individuals (TNs), 31 immunological non-responders (INRs), and 30 immunological responders (IRs); subsequently, we analyzed blood microbe profiles using metagenomic sequencing and Olink proteomics technology, and identify inflammation-related proteins in peripheral blood samples of these individuals. The results showed increased translocation of microbes in the blood of TNs. This translocation did not return to normal level in either IRs or INRs who received antiretroviral therapy. In addition,

            often have increased levels of antibiotic resistance, and these resistance phenotypes are difficult to predict. We used quantitative proteomics to compare the responses of laboratory strain PAO1 and two isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) to four antibiotics and hydrogen peroxide. The majority of proteome changes were unique to either one isolate or treatment, but smaller groups of proteins were differentially abundant in more than one sample. Proteins in these shared adaptive responses represent promising avenues for further investigation to understand the contribution of these proteins to resistance and their potential as targets for novel treatments. We observed the largest overlap between the proteome profiles of PAO1 challenged with tobramycin and hydrogen peroxide, and our data support previous work suggesting a role for heat shock protein IbpA in response to tobramycin. Our proteome profiling uncovered extensive changes in LESB58 in response to carbenicillin, with more than 1,000 proteins significantly changed in abundance. This included unique changes in the abundance of proteins involved in cell wall synthesis and division. We used phase contrast microscopy to check for corresponding changes in cell morphology and show that LESB58 maintained shorter cell lengths under treatment with β-lactams. We propose that the ability to maintain the processes of cell wall synthesis and division through changes in protein abundances contributes to the high levels of β-lactam resistance in LESB58.

            Interactions between plant roots and rhizosphere bacteria modulate nitrogen (N)-cycling processes and create habitats rich in low molecular weight compounds (exudates) and complex organic molecules (decaying root litter) compared to those of bulk soil. Microbial N-cycling is regulated by edaphic conditions and genes from many interconnected metabolic pathways, but most studies of soil N-cycling gene expression have focused on single pathways. Currently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between soil N-cycling gene regulation, spatial habitat, and time. We present results from a replicated time series of soil metatranscriptomes; we followed gene expression of multiple N transformations in four soil habitats (rhizosphere, detritusphere, rhizo-detritusphere, and bulk soil) during active root growth for the annual grass,
            <jats:italic>Avena fatua</jats:italic>
            . The presence of root litter and living roots significantly altered the trajectories of N-cycling gene expression. Upregulation of assimilatory nitrate reduction in the rhizosphere suggests that rhizosphere bacteria were actively competing with roots for nitrate. Simultaneously, ammonium assimilatory pathways were upregulated in both rhizosphere and detritusphere soil, which could have limited N availability to plants. The detritusphere supported dissimilatory processes DNRA and denitrification. Expression of nitrification genes was dominated by three phylotypes of
            <jats:italic>Thaumarchaeota</jats:italic>
            and was upregulated in bulk soil. Unidirectional ammonium assimilation and its regulatory genes (GS/GOGAT) were upregulated near relatively young roots and highly decayed root litter, suggesting N may have been limiting in these habitats (GS/GOGAT is typically activated under N limitation). Our comprehensive analysis indicates that differences in carbon and inorganic N availability control contemporaneous transcription of N-cycling pathways in soil habitats.

            <jats:p>Plant roots modulate microbial nitrogen (N) cycling by regulating the supply of root-derived carbon and nitrogen uptake. These differences in resource availability cause distinct micro-habitats to develop: soil near living roots, decaying roots, near both, or outside the direct influence of roots. While many environmental factors and genes control the microbial processes involved in the nitrogen cycle, most research has focused on single genes and pathways, neglecting the interactive effects these pathways have on each other. The processes controlled by these pathways determine consumption and production of N by soil microorganisms. We followed the expression of N-cycling genes in four soil microhabitats over a period of active root growth for an annual grass. We found that the presence of root litter and living roots significantly altered gene expression involved in multiple nitrogen pathways, as well as tradeoffs between pathways, which ultimately regulate N availability to plants.</jats:p>

              Microbial community changes in response to climate change drivers have the potential to alter the trajectory of important ecosystem functions. In this paper, we show that while microbial communities in peatland systems responded to manipulations of temperature and CO

              concentrations, these changes were not associated with similar responses in peat decomposition rates over 3 years. It is unclear however from our current studies whether this functional resiliency over 3 years will continue over the longer time scales relevant to peatland ecosystem functions.

          <jats:p>
            Hemipteran insects are well-known for their ancient associations with beneficial bacterial endosymbionts, particularly nutritional symbionts that provide the host with essential nutrients such as amino acids or vitamins lacking in the host’s diet. Therefore, these primary endosymbionts enable the exploitation of nutrient-poor food sources such as plant sap or vertebrate blood. In turn, the strictly host-associated lifestyle strongly impacts the genome evolution of the endosymbionts, resulting in small and degraded genomes. Over time, even the essential nutritional functions can be compromised, leading to the complementation or replacement of an ancient endosymbiont by another, more functionally versatile bacterium. Herein, we provide evidence for a dual primary endosymbiosis in several psyllid species. Using metagenome sequencing, we produced the complete genome sequences of both the primary endosymbiont “
            <jats:italic>Candidatus</jats:italic>
            Carsonella ruddii” and an as yet uncharacterized Enterobacteriaceae bacterium from four species of the genus
            <jats:italic>Cacopsylla</jats:italic>
            . The latter represents a new psyllid-associated endosymbiont clade for which we propose the name “
            <jats:italic>Candidatus</jats:italic>
            Psyllophila symbiotica.” Fluorescent
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization confirmed the co-localization of both endosymbionts in the bacteriome. The metabolic repertoire of
            <jats:italic>Psyllophila</jats:italic>
            is highly conserved across host species and complements the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway that is incomplete in the co-occurring
            <jats:italic>Carsonella</jats:italic>
            . Unlike co-primary endosymbionts in other insects, the genome of
            <jats:italic>Psyllophila</jats:italic>
            is almost as small as the one of
            <jats:italic>Carsonella</jats:italic>
            , indicating an ancient co-obligate endosymbiosis rather than a recent association to rescue a degrading primary endosymbiont.

              Heritable beneficial bacterial endosymbionts have been crucial for the evolutionary success of numerous insects by enabling the exploitation of nutritionally limited food sources. Herein, we describe a previously unknown dual endosymbiosis in the psyllid genus
              <jats:italic>Cacopsylla</jats:italic>

              is a co-primary endosymbiont widespread within the genus

          <jats:p>Oral diseases, such as periodontal disease and dental caries, have a high risk of recurrence and are considered to be related to dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and metabolome. It is, therefore, important to understand the state of the oral microbiome and metabolome after disease treatment to prevent recurrence. The current study sought to clarify whether oral dysbiosis improves the following remission of symptoms by dental treatment. To this end, the salivary microbiome and metabolome of healthy participants were compared to those with periodontal disease, dental caries, or both (concurrent). Saliva was collected as mouth-rinsed water and the microbiome was measured using 16S rRNA gene targeted sequencing and metabolome using capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Comparisons with healthy participants were performed before and after treatment, and several months after transition to self-care. Dental treatment significantly improved the oral health condition of each group; several months after treatment, oral health did not deteriorate. However, even after remission, the salivary microbiome of the two groups (oral disease and healthy) differed significantly. Additionally, after remission, significant differences, compared with healthy participants, remained in the relative abundances of disease-related bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria. After remission, significant differences were observed in the salivary metabolome in the healthy group in terms of threonate and pyrimidine metabolism-related component concentrations, which are assumed to reflect the high relative abundance of periodontal disease-related bacteria in the microbiome. Oral microbiome dysbiosis persisted even after dental treatment-induced disease remission with a sustained increased risk of disease when compared with healthy participants.</jats:p>

Dental treatment improved oral health conditions, resulting in oral disease remission; however, the imbalanced state of the salivary microbiome continued even after remission. Although the results of this study are preliminary, owing to the small number of participants in each group when compared to larger cohort studies, they indicate that the risk of disease may remain higher than that of healthy participants, thereby demonstrating the importance of removing dental plaque containing disease-related bacteria using appropriate care even after treatment completion. We also identified bacterial species with relative abundances that differed from those of healthy participants even after remission of symptoms, which may indicate that the maturation of certain bacterial species must be controlled to improve the oral microbiome and reduce the risk of disease recurrence.</jats:p>

            The first few years of life is a key period for the development of the gut microbiome. However, our current understanding of this topic is largely biased toward Western populations. In this study, we characterized the development and determinants of the gut microbiome in a prospective cohort of 112 term Chinese children by sequencing 713 stool samples collected at nine time points from birth to 3 years of age using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We revealed alterations in the composition and alpha and beta diversities of the gut microbiota across the first 3 years of life. We identified mode of delivery, feeding mode, and intrapartum antibiotics as the major determinants of the early-life gut microbiome, the effects of all of which persisted up to 12 months. Importantly, by conducting a nested case–control study, we showed that alterations in the infant gut microbiota precede the development of eczema. Interestingly, we identified a depletion of
            <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>
            and an enrichment of
            <jats:italic>Clostridium sensu stricto 1</jats:italic>

The same patterns were also observed in C-section-born infants within the same time frames, suggesting a role of the gut microbiota in previously reported associations between C-section and increased risk of eczema. Our study has revealed important associations between the gut microbiome and eczema in infancy and has established the basis for potential prevention/treatment of eczema via modulation of the gut microbiota.

              Eczema is a major allergic disease in children, which is particularly prevalent in Chinese children during their first year of life.

While there were several common differentially expressed bacterial genes across different timepoints after infection, mammalian transcriptional profiles were quite distinct, with little overlap. Interestingly, an induction of colonic receptors for
            <jats:italic>C. difficile</jats:italic>

Gene function and pathway enrichment analyses revealed a potential modulation of the purine/pyrimidine synthesis pathways both in the mammalian and bacterial cells. We observed that proline-proline endopeptidase, a secreted metalloprotease responsible for cell surface protein cleavage, is downregulated during infection, and a mutant lacking this enzyme demonstrated enhanced adhesion to epithelial cells during infection.

Based on comparative genomic analyses of 11 Hippoboscidae-associated strains, 9 of them newly assembled, we reveal a wide range of their genomic characteristics and phylogenetic affiliations. Phylogenetic patterns and genomic traits split the strains into two different types. Seven strains display characteristics of obligate mutualists with significantly reduced genomes and long phylogenetic branches. The remaining four strains cluster on short branches, and their genomes resemble those of free-living bacteria or facultative symbionts. Both phylogenetic positions and genomic traits indicate that evolutionary history of the Hippoboscidae-

While some (riboflavin, pantothenate, and folate) seem to be synthesized by all Hippoboscidae-associated obligate symbionts, pathways for others (thiamine, nicotinamide, and cobalamin) are mostly missing. On the other hand, the broad comparison has produced patterns that can serve as bases for further assessments of the pathways’ completeness and functionality.

          <jats:p>The N4-like viruses, which were recently assigned to the novel viral family Schitoviridae in 2021, belong to a podoviral-like viral lineage and possess conserved genomic characteristics and a unique replication mechanism. Despite their significance, our understanding of N4-like viruses is primarily based on viral isolates. To address this knowledge gap, this study has established a comprehensive N4-like viral data sets comprising 342 high-quality N4-like viruses/proviruses (144 viral isolates, 158 uncultured viruses, and 40 integrated N4-like proviruses). These viruses were classified into 97 subfamilies (89 of which are newly identified), 148 genera (100 of which are newly identified), and 253 species (177 of which are newly identified). The study reveals that N4-like viruses inhibit the polar region, oligotrophic open oceans, and the human gut, where they infect various bacterial lineages, such as Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Epsilon-proteobacteria in the Proteobacteria phylum. Although N4-like viral endogenization appears to be prevalent in Proteobacteria, it has also been observed in Firmicutes. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis has identified evolutionary divergence within the hallmark genes of N4-like viruses, indicating a complex origin of the different conserved parts of viral genomes. Moreover, 1,101 putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified in the N4-like viral pan-proteome, which mainly participate in nucleotide and cofactor/vitamin metabolisms. Of these AMGs, 27 were found to be associated with virulence, suggesting their potential involvement in the spread of bacterial pathogenicity.</jats:p>

Diarrheal pathogens are transmitted through environmental reservoirs; however, the bacterial clones that spread across the human-environment interface remain unexplored. We aimed to determine the relationship and clonal dissemination of ETEC between children with diarrhea and polluted water samples from a local river in La Paz, Bolivia. By using WGS and the PhenePlates phenotypic system to analyze ETEC strains, we showed that ST218 and ST410 LT+STh ETEC expressing the colonization factor (CF) CS23 were found with high frequency in both samples. The CS23 ETEC isolates were found within several STs,
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            phylogroups, and across ETEC lineages. Comparative genomic evaluation and PhenePlate screening of globally distributed clinical ETEC strains suggest that the CS23 gene is likely carried on plasmids acquired independently of the bacterial chromosomal background. Clinical strains were more often multidrug-resistant (MDR) than environmental isolates and harbored the class 1 integron-integrase gene
            <jats:italic>intI1</jats:italic>
            next to the MDR cassettes. Retrospective analysis of antibiotic resistance in ETEC revealed a high frequency of MDR in clinical isolates. The LT+STh CS23 environmental ETEC isolates, showed an increased biofilm ability at environmental temperature, equal cytotoxicity, and significantly lower adherence to human epithelial cells compared to ETEC expressing other CFs. Together, we suggest that CS23 is more prevalent in ETEC than previously estimated, and the Choqueyapu River is a reservoir for LT+STh CS23 ETEC containing strains capable of causing diarrheal cases in children.

These findings highlight the Choqueyapu River as a potential reservoir for emerging pathogens carrying antibiotic-resistance genes, making it a crucial area for monitoring and intervention. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, high-throughput method for tracking bacterial pathogens in low- and middle-income countries, making it a valuable tool for One Health monitoring efforts.

          <jats:p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with limited treatments, and dietary intervention may be effective and affordable for managing symptoms. Glucosinolate compounds are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts, especially glucoraphanin (GLR), and can be metabolized by certain mammalian gut bacteria into anti-inflammatory isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Gut microbiota exhibit biogeographic patterns, but it is unknown if colitis alters these or whether the location of glucoraphanin-metabolizing bacteria affects anti-inflammatory benefits. We fed specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 34-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC). We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, lipocalin, serum cytokines, and bacterial communities from the luminal- and mucosal-associated populations in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet with DSS treatment performed better than mice fed the control diet with DSS, and had significantly more weight gain, lower Disease Activity Index scores, lower plasma lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines, and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations. Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location but were more homogenous across locations in the control diet + DSS mice. Importantly, our results showed that broccoli sprout feeding abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial richness and biogeography were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Collectively, these results support the protective effect of steamed broccoli sprouts against dysbiosis and colitis induced by DSS.</jats:p>

Here, we show that 10% steamed broccoli sprouts in the diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographic patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet during colitis performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS. The identification of accessible dietary components and concentrations that help maintain and correct the gut microbiome may provide universal and equitable approaches to IBD prevention and recovery, and broccoli sprouts represent a promising strategy.</jats:p>

            Gastric cancer is the second most prevalent and deadly cancer in China. Microbiota play an important role in gastric tumorigenesis. However, the available microbial marker studies for gastric cancer do not have consistent results. We searched PubMed for 16S rRNA sequencing in relevant literature on Chinese patients from 1 January 2005 to 18 July 2022, and 16 original articles were finally obtained. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, and bacterial taxa were used to explore the differences in gastric microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size and a random forest model were used to find the combination of genera with the best diagnostic efficacy.

Studies have revealed significant differences in gastric microbiota between patients with gastric cancer and non-cancerous patients, suggesting that microbiota may play a role in tumorigenesis. In this meta-analysis, existing 16S rRNA microbial data were analyzed to find combinations consisting of five genera, which had good efficacy in distinguishing gastric cancer from non-cancerous patients in multiple types of samples. These results lend support to the use of microbial markers in detecting gastric cancer.

            Understanding the allocation of the cellular proteome to different cellular processes is central to unraveling the organizing principles of bacterial physiology. Proteome allocation to protein translation itself is maximally efficient, i.e., it represents the minimal allocation of dry mass able to sustain the observed protein production rate. In contrast, recent studies on bacteria have demonstrated that the concentrations of many proteins exceed the minimal level required to support the observed growth rate, indicating some heterogeneity across pathways in their proteome efficiency. Here, we systematically analyze the proteome efficiency of metabolic pathways, which together account for more than half of the
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            proteome during exponential growth. Comparing the predicted minimal and the observed proteome allocation to different metabolic pathways across growth conditions, we find that the protein abundance in the most costly biosynthesis pathways—those for amino acid biosynthesis and cofactor biosynthesis—is regulated for near-optimal efficiency. Overall, proteome efficiency increases along the carbon flow through the metabolic network; proteins involved in pathways of nutrient uptake and central metabolism tend to be highly over-abundant, while proteins involved in anabolic pathways and in protein translation are much closer to the expected minimal abundance across conditions. Our work thus provides a bird’s-eye view of metabolic pathway efficiency, demonstrating systematic deviations from optimal cellular efficiency at the network level.

              Protein translation is the most expensive cellular process in fast-growing bacteria, and efficient proteome usage should thus be under strong natural selection. However, recent studies show that a considerable part of the proteome is unneeded for instantaneous cell growth in
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              . We still lack a systematic understanding of how this excess proteome is distributed across different pathways as a function of the growth conditions. We estimated the minimal required proteome across growth conditions in
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              and compared the predictions with experimental data. We found that the proteome allocated to the most expensive internal pathways, including translation and the synthesis of amino acids and cofactors, is near the minimally required levels. In contrast, transporters and central carbon metabolism show much higher proteome levels than the predicted minimal abundance. Our analyses show that the proteome fraction unneeded for instantaneous cell growth decreases along the nutrient flow in

            Gut microbial dysbiosis has been observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The beneficial impact of exercise, the recommended lifestyle change for NAFLD patients, might be mediated by the gut microbiome (GM). However, the exact taxonomic and functional signatures associated with the host’s clinical and biochemical improvement during exercise in NAFLD patients have not been elucidated yet. To investigate the impact of exercise on GM and reveal GM structures associated with NAFLD improvement during exercise. Stool samples from a 12-week randomized controlled exercise study on NAFLD subjects (
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            = 39) were retrieved, and shotgun metagenomics was performed at baseline and endpoint. Differential correlation network and enrichment analysis were applied to characterize the GM taxonomic and functional changes during the exercise intervention and to associate GM changes with biomarkers of liver status and metabolic dysregulation. Network analysis demonstrated that exercise induced significant changes in the bacterial interactome, which were associated with waist circumference; resting metabolic rate; plasma fasting concentrations of triglyceride, glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin A1c; and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance. Grouping the patients in the exercise group (
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>

We showed that even though exercise has not a significant impact on the alpha- and beta-diversity of NAFLD patients, it leads to a significant re-structuring of the gut bacteria interactome and that specific structural changes can be linked with improvements in IHL.

The majority of microbiome research has focused on finding specific species that may contribute to the development of human diseases. However, we believe that complex diseases, such as NAFLD, would be more efficiently treated using consortia of species, given that bacterial functionality is based not only on its own genetic information but also on the interaction with other microorganisms. Our results revealed that exercise significantly changes the GM interaction and that structural alterations can be linked with improvements in intrahepatic lipid content and metabolic functions. We believe that the identification of these characteristics in the GM enhances the development of exercise treatment for NAFLD and will attract general interest in this field.</jats:p>

            In mammals, myrmecophagy (ant and termite consumption) represents a striking example of dietary convergence. This trait evolved independently at least five times in placentals with myrmecophagous species comprising aardvarks, anteaters, some armadillos, pangolins, and aardwolves. The gut microbiome plays an important role in dietary adaptation, and previous analyses of 16S rRNA metabarcoding data have revealed convergence in the composition of the gut microbiota among some myrmecophagous species. However, the functions performed by these gut bacterial symbionts and their potential role in the digestion of prey chitinous exoskeletons remain open questions. Using long- and short-read sequencing of fecal samples, we generated 29 gut metagenomes from nine myrmecophagous and closely related insectivorous species sampled in French Guiana, South Africa, and the United States. From these, we reconstructed 314 high-quality bacterial genome bins of which 132 carried chitinase genes, highlighting their potential role in insect prey digestion. These chitinolytic bacteria belonged mainly to the family Lachnospiraceae, and some were likely convergently recruited in the different myrmecophagous species as they were detected in several host orders (i.e.,
            <jats:italic>Enterococcus faecalis</jats:italic>
            ,
            <jats:italic>Blautia</jats:italic>
            sp.), suggesting that they could be directly involved in the adaptation to myrmecophagy. Others were found to be more host-specific, possibly reflecting phylogenetic constraints and environmental influences. Overall, our results highlight the potential role of the gut microbiome in chitin digestion in myrmecophagous mammals and provide the basis for future comparative studies performed at the mammalian scale to further unravel the mechanisms underlying the convergent adaptation to myrmecophagy.

            <jats:p>Myrmecophagous mammals are specialized in the consumption of ants and/or termites. They do not share a direct common ancestor and evolved convergently in five distinct placental orders raising questions about the underlying adaptive mechanisms involved and the relative contribution of natural selection and phylogenetic constraints. Understanding how these species digest their prey can help answer these questions. More specifically, the role of their gut microbial symbionts in the digestion of the insect chitinous exoskeleton has not been investigated in all myrmecophagous orders. We generated 29 new gut metagenomes from nine myrmecophagous species to reconstruct more than 300 bacterial genomes in which we identified chitin-degrading enzymes. Studying the distribution of these chitinolytic bacteria among hosts revealed both shared and specific bacteria between ant-eating species. Overall, our results highlight the potential role of gut symbionts in the convergent dietary adaptation of myrmecophagous mammals and the evolutionary mechanisms shaping their gut microbiota.</jats:p>

            Constraint-based modeling has risen as an alternative for characterizing metabolism of communities. Adaptations of flux balance analysis have been proposed to model metabolic interactions, which in most cases consider the maximization of biomass production as their objective. In nature, novel essential functions are not directly related to cell growth force communities to display suboptimal growth rates. These suboptimal states allow a degree of plasticity in their metabolism, thus allowing quick shifts between alternative flux distributions as an initial response to environmental changes. In this work, we introduce the abundance-growth space as a representation of metabolic phenotypes of a community. This space is defined by the composition of a community, represented by its members’ relative abundances, and their growth rate. The analysis of this space allows us to pinpoint how critical reactions respond to shifts of the environment, showing where changes in community plasticity occur. Interestingly, it highlights the relevance of the relative abundance of its members in the lost or gain of plasticity. This method is applied to two simple communities that exchange metabolites. A synthetic community of two mutant

          <jats:p>Bacteriophage comparative genomics is complex due to the mosaic nature of the genomes, and an underlying continuum of diversity confounds the identification of clear taxonomic boundaries. Nucleotide sequence comparison methods have been described for phage taxonomy, but they are computationally intensive and scale poorly as the number of sequenced phage genomes increases. Here, we describe PhamClust as a new bioinformatic approach for grouping phages according to their inter-genome relatedness. PhamClust calculates a proteomic equivalence quotient (PEQ) for each pair of phages based on amino acid sequence identity for those genes that are shared among phages. PEQ values span from 0% (no shared genes) to 100% (all genes shared at 100% identity), and using a large mycobacteriophage genome data set, we show that two-step clustering down to a PEQ of 25% constructs genome groupings (clusters) closely mirroring those constructed manually over time, with the differences attributable to historically arising incongruities rather than illogicalities in PhamClust. PEQ values can also faithfully divide clusters into subclusters, although the relationships are highly heterogeneous, with different PEQ values needed for the subdivision of different clusters. PhamClust can be used to assort any group of phages, including the RefSeq phage collection.</jats:p>

            The human microbiome ecosystems living within the human body are exposed to exogenous foreign substances from the various environments that humans live within. Therefore, dynamics between microbes and human hosts can be influenced by environmental changes, which potentially impact microbiome composition and diversity. Geographic area, as a microbiome-relevant environmental factor, has been well reported. Human geography, however, is often linked to socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic population enclaves, and disparities in area disadvantage. Potential mechanisms linking the microbiome to factors tied to area disadvantage include household crowding, use of public transportation, and lack of exposure to biodiverse natural environments. Through an analysis of data from the Human Microbiome Project including healthy adults who reported residential area information at the time of microbiome sampling (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 201), we found a significant relationship between the social vulnerability index (SVI), as a measure of area disadvantage, and multiple alpha diversity measures across oral, airways, and urogenital sites when controlling for age, gender, and body mass index. With regard to race/ethnicity, we found significant mediation by SVI score to explain racial/ethnic differences in urogenital microbiome diversity in females. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental variables such as area social vulnerability as a variable of interest in microbiome studies within healthy individuals and suggest a potential role to explain urogenital race/ethnicity differences. Future studies including a diverse, representative community-based population, more precise residential location, and inclusion of related risk factors such as dietary intake, are needed to further understand the implications of these results.

            infection poses a critical challenge to global public health, and the situation is exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophages (phages) are increasingly being used as antimicrobial agents due to their ability to kill specific bacteria. However, the low cellular uptake of phages has limited their use in treating intracellular bacterial infections. Here, we present a study using engineered phages with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) for enhancing the internalization efficiency of phages to inhibit bacterial intracellular infections. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified a phage-encoded protein harboring an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain as the potential target for phage display. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based method, we successfully displayed short peptides on GP94, an Ig-like domain-containing protein, of
            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>

              infection is a significant threat to global public health, and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance exacerbates the situation. Therefore, finding new and effective ways to combat this pathogen is essential. Phages are natural predators of bacteria and can be used as an alternative to antibiotics to kill specific bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. One significant limitation of using phages as antimicrobial agents is their low cellular uptake, which limits their effectiveness against intracellular bacterial infections. Therefore, finding ways to enhance phage uptake is crucial. Our study provides a straightforward strategy for displaying cell-penetrating peptides on non-model phages, offering a promising novel and effective therapeutic approach for treating intracellular and drug-resistant bacteria. This approach has the potential to address the global challenge of antibiotic resistance and improve public health outcomes.

            There is limited knowledge on the bacteriome and resistome in livestock in Africa and the potential influence of the animal husbandry practices and scale has also been scantly explored. We quantified and characterized the antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) pools (resistomes) and bacteriome in 30 pigs and 60 poultry samples (free-range: rural and urban, and industrialized) across Ghana using Resfinder and Silva databases and compared them to similar data from pigs and poultry from nine European countries. The pig and poultry were very different in ARG and bacterial abundance and composition. The bacterial communities in the Ghanaian samples also differed substantially from the European samples, especially driven by a much higher abundance of
            <jats:italic>Subdoligranulum</jats:italic>
            in both animals. We found lower ARG loads in Ghanaian pigs compared to European counterparts. Among poultry, urban free-range samples exhibited lower ARG abundances compared to the lowest European levels, while rural free-range samples were comparable to the European average, and industrialized samples showed higher ARG abundances. Despite major differences in abundance, the resistome composition of Ghanaian urban, rural, and industrialized poultry samples was similar. Contrasts with European samples were mainly driven by increased abundances of different tetracycline resistance genes in Ghanaian samples, and increased abundances of ARGs encoding resistance to macrolides, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim in Europe. Among pig samples, the main differences were caused by ARGs encoding resistance to nitroimidazoles, beta-lactams, and macrolides in European samples. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on the resistome measured using metagenomics in livestock from Sub-Saharan Africa.

In both intracellular and extracellular metabolite profiles, we observe striking differences across strains in the accumulation and release of molecules, such as the DNA methylating agent S-adenosyl-methionine (intracellular) and the branched-chain amino acids (intracellular) and their precursors (extracellular). While some differences reflect variable genome content across the strains, others likely reflect variable regulation of conserved pathways. In the extracellular profiles, we identify molecules such as pantothenic acid and aromatic amino acids that may serve as currencies in

          <jats:p>The saturating relationship between phytoplankton growth rate and environmental nutrient concentration has been widely observed, yet the mechanisms behind the relationship remain elusive. Here, we use a mechanistic model of phytoplankton and show that the saturating relationship between growth rate and phosphorous concentration can be interpreted by intracellular macromolecular allocation. At low nutrient levels, the diffusive nutrient transport linearly increases with the phosphorous concentration, while the internal phosphorous requirement increases with the growth rate, leading to a non-linear increase in the growth rate with phosphorous. This increased phosphorous requirement is due to the increased allocation to biosynthetic and photosynthetic molecules. The allocation to these molecules reaches a maximum at high-phosphorous concentration, and the growth rate no longer increases despite the rise in phosphorous concentration. The produced growth rate and phosphorous relationships are consistent with the data of phytoplankton across taxa. Our study suggests that the key control of phytoplankton growth is internal, and nutrient uptake is only a single step in the overall process.</jats:p>

            <jats:italic>Bacillus</jats:italic>
            genus as they adapt to abiotic and biotic surfaces, we revived the archived population samples from our four previous experimental evolution studies and performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing. Surprisingly, higher number of mutations, higher genotypic diversity, and higher evolvability were detected in the biotic conditions with smaller population size. Different adaptation strategies were observed in different environments within each species, with more diversified mutational spectrum detected in biotic conditions. The insertion sequences of
            <jats:italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</jats:italic>
            are critical for its adaptation to the plastic bead-attached biofilm environment, but insertion sequence mobility was a general phenomenon in this species independent of the selection condition. Additionally, certain parallel evolution has been observed across species and environments, particularly when two species adapt to the same environment at the same time. Furthermore, our results suggest that the population size might be an important driver of evolution. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species’ biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.

              Biofilm formation is a vital factor for the survival and adaptation of bacteria in diverse environmental niches. Experimental evolution combined with the advancement of whole-population genome sequencing provides us a powerful tool to understand the genomic dynamic of evolutionary adaptation to different environments, such as during biofilm development. Previous studies described the genetic and phenotypic changes of selected clones from experimentally evolved
              <jats:italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Bacillus subtilis</jats:italic>
              that were adapted under abiotic and biotic biofilm conditions. However, the full understanding of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes was lacking. Furthermore, the differences and similarities of adaptive mechanisms in

              were not identified. To overcome these limitations, we performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing to study the underlying genetic dynamics at high resolution. Our study provides the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species’ biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.

            <jats:italic>Myxococcus xanthus</jats:italic>
            is a model organism with a set of diverse behaviors. These behaviors include the starvation-induced multicellular development program, in which cells move collectively to assemble multicellular aggregates. After initial aggregates have formed, some will disperse, with smaller aggregates having a higher chance of dispersal. Initial aggregation is driven by two changes in cell behavior: cells slow down inside of aggregates and bias their motion by reversing direction less frequently when moving toward aggregates. However, the cell behaviors that drive dispersal are unknown. Here, we use fluorescent microscopy to quantify changes in cell behavior after initial aggregates have formed. We observe that after initial aggregate formation, cells adjust the bias in reversal timings by initiating reversals more rapidly when approaching unstable aggregates. Using agent-based modeling, we then show dispersal is predominantly generated by this change in bias, which is strong enough to overcome slowdown inside aggregates. Notably, the change in reversal bias is correlated with the nearest aggregate size, connecting cellular activity to previously observed correlations between aggregate size and fate. To determine if this connection is consistent across strains, we analyze a second
            <jats:italic>M. xanthus</jats:italic>
            strain with reduced levels of dispersal. We find that far fewer cells near smaller aggregates modified their bias. This implies that aggregate dispersal is under genetic control, providing a foundation for further investigations into the role it plays in the life cycle of

              Understanding the processes behind bacterial biofilm formation, maintenance, and dispersal is essential for addressing their effects on health and ecology. Within these multicellular communities, various cues can trigger differentiation into distinct cell types, allowing cells to adapt to their specific local environment. The soil bacterium
              <jats:italic>Myxococcus xanthus</jats:italic>
              forms biofilms in response to starvation, marked by cells aggregating into mounds. Some aggregates persist as spore-filled fruiting bodies, while others disperse after initial formation for unknown reasons. Here, we use a combination of cell tracking analysis and computational simulations to identify behaviors at the cellular level that contribute to aggregate dispersal. Our results suggest that cells in aggregates actively determine whether to disperse or persist and undergo a transition to sporulation based on a self-produced cue related to the aggregate size. Identifying these cues is an important step in understanding and potentially manipulating bacterial cell-fate decisions.

            Disruption of blood glucose utilization may lead to diabetes mellitus, which has complex genetic and environmental aspects, and free fatty acid receptors (FFARs) may bridge the genetic and dietary aspects. FFAR4 has been identified as a new target for diabetes treatment, and it is essential to investigate how FFAR4 affects glucose homeostasis. FFAR4 knockout mice have been shown to cause severely impaired glucose tolerance under high-fat feeding conditions; however, the findings in FFAR4 knockout mice under chow diet conditions seem to be contradictory. Blood glucose utilization in mice under chow diet conditions is thought to show diurnal rhythmicity. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of FFAR4 in glucose utilization rhythm and explore the possible mechanism. Total

            Calf diarrhea is a multifactorial disease that affects the cattle industry and accounts for more than 50% of calf mortality. Although there is evidence of an association between altered gut microbiota and diarrhea, remarkably little is known about the microbial and metabolic mechanisms underlying the link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the occurrence of calf diarrhea. Here, we performed fecal metagenomic and metabolomic studies on fecal samples from diarrheic and healthy calves of Xia-nan cattle breed. Results revealed that composition of the gut microbiome and metabolome was remarkably altered in diarrheic calves, and gut microbial alterations were associated with diarrhea and linked to the changes in metabolites. Metabolite profiles showed that diarrheic calves exhibited a marked decrease in some purines (adenosine, adenine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, allantoate, deoxyinosine, and deoxyguanosine) and arachidonic acid (prostaglandin F2α and prostaglandin E2) compared to healthy calves. Purine-producing microbial species, including

Our study showed that gut microbiota-driven metabolic disorders of purine or arachidonic acid were associated with calf diarrhea. The findings prove that altered gut microbiota plays a role in diarrhea pathogenesis and indicate that gut microbiota-targeted therapies could be useful for both prevention and treatment of diarrhea.

Hence, in this study, we attempt to unravel community formation mechanisms through research in pit mud microbial biogeography based on 12 independent bacterial studies comprising qualified data sets of 302 samples clearly marked with cellar age from five major producing provinces. We found cellar age explained more variations in the bacterial community than geographical region. The bacterial community displayed evident dominant species alternations on a large time scale.

Null model analysis revealed that as pit mud aged, the influence of stochastic and deterministic processes in the bacterial community shifted, and the relative contribution of homogeneous selection increased. Positive correlations dominated the bacterial co-occurrence networks, and the network complexity decreased and stability increased with cellar age. These findings shed new light on the formation of pit mud microbiomes under the impact of long-term batch-to-batch continuous brewing, providing a basis for the evaluation and production of high-quality pit mud.

However, each single independent study rarely yields a thorough understanding of the pit mud ecosystem. Will the pit mud microbial communities in different production regions exhibit similar succession patterns and structures under the impact of the brewing environment? Hence, we conducted research in pit mud microbial biogeography to uncover the impact of specific environment on the microbial community over a long time scale.

          <jats:p>Given increased wildfire activity, there is growing interest in understanding the drivers of microbial succession after fire. Dispersal may be especially important to post-fire succession as biotic communities can be more susceptible to invasion following a disturbance. Here, we experimentally manipulated dispersal into disturbed leaf litter communities collected following a wildfire and tracked bacterial and fungal dispersal assemblages over time. We show that the identity and source of microbes immigrating into the soil surface post-fire change across time with seasonal shifts and the reemergence of aboveground vegetation. Further, dispersal significantly contributed to the reassembly of leaf litter microbial communities after the fire, producing an increasingly distinct assembly trajectory. The effect of dispersal on α-diversity and β-diversity was ecosystem dependent but, unexpectedly, influenced bacterial and fungal communities in a similar manner within ecosystems. Collectively, these results demonstrate that dispersal explicitly alters the course of microbial community succession following a wildfire and may impact bacteria and fungi in parallel ways, despite differing in traits expected to alter dispersal patterns.</jats:p>

            genomes. Prophages are unevenly distributed among mycobacteria;
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
            strains are devoid of intact prophages, whereas 75% of
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium abscessus-chelonae</jats:italic>
            strains carry at least one prophage, and some have up to nine. Newly discovered prophage sequences are generally distinct from those of lytic phages isolated using
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</jats:italic>
            as a host, although assembly of over 3,800 phage and prophage genomes into clusters based on shared sequence similarity yields seven clusters containing both phage and prophage genomes.
            <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
            prophages use a usually large repertoire of
            <jats:italic>attB</jats:italic>
            sites for prophage integration, and new integration-proficient vectors demonstrate the functionality of integration systems identified
            <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>
            and provide tools useful for advancing
            <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
            genetics. Genomic analysis reveals additional accessory and likely mobile parts of
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium</jats:italic>
            genomes including defective prophages, prophage-like regions, and satellite elements proposed to be candidate phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs).
            <jats:italic>M. abscessus</jats:italic>
            prophages and PICIs are unusual in that they often encode phage-encoded ESX-secreted toxin (PEST) systems that are located adjacent to the phage integration functions and are lysogenically expressed and likely provide a fitness advantage to their host.

          <jats:p>Despite multiple vaccine doses early in life, a substantial proportion of infants do not mount protective responses. In this study, we followed a cohort of children over the first 2 years of life, collecting microbiome and metabolome data longitudinally to investigate correlates of lower and higher responses to primary vaccinations. We found that the stool and nasopharyngeal microbiome developed with age, though demonstrated divergent timing and patterns in maturation. When measured at child age 2 months, evenness of genera in the stool microbiome correlated with lower vaccine responses, upregulated metabolome genes that encode for lipid A biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation correlated with higher vaccine responses, and abundance of phenylpyruvic acid in serum correlated with lower vaccine responses, measured 10 months later. Antibiotic exposure was associated with low vaccine response, and microbiome/metabolome features at child age 2 months, before childhood vaccinations commenced, correlated with variations in vaccine responses measured at child age 1 year. These results indicate that there may be potential to intervene before first childhood vaccinations to improve later protection.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>We show that simultaneous study of stool and nasopharyngeal microbiome reveals divergent timing and patterns of maturation, suggesting that local mucosal factors may influence microbiome composition in the gut and respiratory system. Antibiotic exposure in early life as occurs commonly, may have an adverse effect on vaccine responsiveness. Abundance of gut and/or nasopharyngeal bacteria with the machinery to produce lipopolysaccharide—a toll-like receptor 4 agonist—may positively affect future vaccine protection, potentially by acting as a natural adjuvant. The increased levels of serum phenylpyruvic acid in infants with lower vaccine-induced antibody levels suggest an increased abundance of hydrogen peroxide, leading to more oxidative stress in low vaccine-responding infants.</jats:p>

            Polymicrobial biofilms are present in many environments particularly in the human oral cavity where they can prevent or facilitate the onset of disease. While recent advances have provided a clear picture of both the constituents and their biogeographic arrangement, it is still unclear what mechanisms of interaction occur between individual species in close proximity within these communities. In this study, we investigated two mechanisms of interaction between the highly abundant supragingival plaque (SUPP) commensal

            enhanced the fitness of streptococci dependent on its ability to detoxify streptococcal-produced hydrogen peroxide and its ability to oxidize lactate also produced by streptococci. We demonstrate that the fitness of adjacent streptococci was linked to that of

            and that these mechanisms support the previously described “corncob” arrangement between these species but that this is favorable only in aerobic conditions.

              As the microbiome era matures, the need for mechanistic interaction data between species is crucial to understand how stable microbiomes are preserved, especially in healthy conditions where the microbiota could help resist opportunistic or exogenous pathogens. Here we reveal multiple mechanisms of interaction between two commensals that dictate their biogeographic relationship to each other in previously described structures in human supragingival plaque. Using a novel variation for chemical detection, we observed metabolite exchange between individual bacterial cells in real time validating the ability of these organisms to carry out metabolic crossfeeding at distal and temporal scales observed

            Small open reading frames (smORFs) are widely distributed in various living organisms. However, their functions remain largely unexplored. In addition, annotation and detection of smORFs are limited using existing methods and hindered by their specific properties. In this study, we systematically investigated smORFs and smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs) in
            <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>
            , which are well-known bacterial producers of diverse bioactive secondary metabolites. We established a peptidogenomic workflow based on multi-integrated comprehensive database search and database-independent

            A3 (2). Functional analysis of universal smORFs revealed enrichment in biosynthetic processes, stress response, ribosomes, and nucleic acid binding. Meanwhile, 5 Cryptic smORF-encoded Peptides (CSEPs) distributed in non-annotated regions of the genome, and non-coding RNAs could encode for CSEPs. A total of 66 new RNAs, including 32 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) were revealed, and 4 ncRNA-encoded peptides were identified. Furthermore, an investigation of carbon metabolism showed that NagE functions in spore formation and secondary metabolism in
            <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>
            . Particularly, NagE was observed to function in the biosynthesis of anti-complement agents in

The ncRNAs and SEPs present rich sources for engineering streptomycetes to produce bioactive compounds.

            <jats:p>Due to their small size and special chemical features, small open reading frame (smORF)-encoding peptides (SEPs) are often neglected. However, they may play critical roles in regulating gene expression, enzyme activity, and metabolite production. Studies on bacterial microproteins have mainly focused on pathogenic bacteria, which are importance to systematically investigate SEPs in streptomycetes and are rich sources of bioactive secondary metabolites. Our study is the first to perform a global identification of smORFs in streptomycetes. We established a peptidogenomic workflow for non-model microbial strains and identified multiple novel smORFs that are potentially linked to secondary metabolism in streptomycetes. Our multi-integrated approach in this study is meaningful to improve the quality and quantity of the detected smORFs. Ultimately, the workflow we established could be extended to other organisms and would benefit the genome mining of microproteins with critical functions for regulation and engineering useful microorganisms.</jats:p>

Looking more broadly, queer and trans scientists are systematically marginalized across scientific fields, leading to disparities in career outcomes, professional networks, and opportunities, as well as the loss of unique scientific perspectives at all levels. For queer and trans folks with multiple, intersecting, marginalized identities, these barriers often become even more severe.

Many of the SIP-enriched MAGs (20/42) encoded a complete alkane oxidation pathway, including alkane monooxygenase (AlkB), rubredoxin reductase (AlkT), and rubredoxin-2 (AlkG). Fourteen Aphaproteobacteria MAGs lacked AlkG for electron transfer. Instead, they encoded novel disulfide isomerases with iron-binding cysteine motifs conserved across rubredoxins.

              Petroleum pollution in the ocean has increased because of rapid population growth and modernization, requiring urgent remediation. Our understanding of the metabolic response of native microbial communities to oil spills is not well understood. Here, we explored the baseline hydrocarbon-degrading communities of a subarctic Atlantic region to uncover the metabolic potential of the bacteria that inhabit the surface and subsurface water. We conducted enrichments with a
              <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>
              C-labeled hydrocarbon to capture the fraction of the community actively using the hydrocarbon. We then combined this approach with metagenomics to identify the metabolic potential of this hydrocarbon-degrading community. This revealed previously undescribed uncultured bacteria with unique metabolic mechanisms involved in aerobic hydrocarbon degradation, indicating that temperature may be pivotal in structuring hydrocarbon-degrading baseline communities. Our findings highlight gaps in our understanding of the metabolic complexity of hydrocarbon degradation by native marine microbial communities.

            <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>
            is the hallmark of a healthy vaginal microbiome (VM) and lack of dominance may make women BV-prone. A more recent characterization is that the human VMs can be classified into five major types, four of which possess type-specific dominant species of

Nevertheless, exceptions to the first hypothesis have been noticed from the very beginning, and there is not a definite relationship, suggested yet, between the five VM types and BV status. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis that assumes the existence of four VM types from dichotomous crisscrossing of “complex versus simple (high-diversity or low-dominance versus low-diversity or high-dominance)” on “healthy versus BV” (the four essential dimensions of VMs). We comprehensively test the hypothesis with 7,958 VM samples by demonstrating the statistically significant differences between the four VM types in community diversity, composition, dominance, heterogeneity, and stochasticity, and by identifying unique/enriched species in each VM type. We further verified the categorization (hypothesis) by using six machine learning (ML) algorithms, including deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) technology, to reclassify the randomly mixed VM samples into four respective types and achieved 85%–100% classification precisions. Our hypothesis provides a foundation for further investigating the etiology and automatic diagnosis of BV based on inexpensive amplicon sequencing and AI technology.

            Neuraminidase (NA) is a pivotal surface enzyme and a key therapeutic target in combating the influenza A virus. Its evolution can lead to potential zoonotic transmission, seasonal epidemics, and the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. To gain comprehensive insights into the mutational effects and drug resistance profiles of NA, we employed a high-throughput profiling system to quantify the replication capacity of NA mutants at the single-nucleotide level in mouse lung tissues. The fitness of NA mutants is generally correlated with natural mutation occurrence and is constrained by both the requirement to maintain protein stability and NA function. Leveraging this system, we profiled the drug resistance to the three most commonly used neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs): zanamivir, oseltamivir, and peramivir. In addition to identifying previously reported drug resistance mutations, we validated novel mutants. Notably, we identified an allosteric mutation that confers resistance to all three drugs, which may affect drug binding by interfering with the tetramerization of NA. Moreover, the fitness cost associated with drug-resistant mutations may limit their widespread dissemination. In summary, we provided a parallel characterization of NA’s fitness and drug resistance landscape in an

              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              is essential for comprehending the evolutionary constraints and making informed choices regarding drug selection to combat resistance in clinical settings. In the current study, we established an efficient deep mutational screening system in mouse lung tissues and systematically evaluated the fitness effect and drug resistance to three neuraminidase inhibitors of NA single-nucleotide mutations. The fitness of NA mutants is generally correlated with a natural mutation in the database. The fitness of NA mutants is influenced by biophysical factors such as protein stability, complex formation, and the immune response triggered by viral infection. In addition to confirming previously reported drug-resistant mutations, novel mutations were identified. Interestingly, we identified an allosteric drug-resistance mutation that is not located within the drug-binding pocket but potentially affects drug binding by interfering with NA tetramerization. The dual assessments performed in this study provide a more accurate assessment of the evolutionary potential of drug-resistant mutations and offer guidance for the rational selection of antiviral drugs.

          <jats:p>Recent advances in adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing have provided abundant B cell receptor (BCR) sequences under various conditions, including vaccination and disease. However, determining target antigen and epitope specificity of the corresponding antibodies is a major challenge due to their exceptional sequence diversity. Here, we introduce a novel method to cluster antibodies sharing antigenic targets based on their complementarity determining region (CDR) sequences. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binders and non-RBD binders from publicly available BCR data were classified correctly, with a cluster purity of 95%. These clusters were then leveraged for annotating unlabeled COVID-19 patient BCR data, enabling the discovery of novel anti-RBD antibodies. We further validated the method by clustering BCR repertoires obtained from single-cell immune profiling of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP)-vaccinated donors. Antibody expression and antigen-binding assays demonstrated that the clusters exhibited 96% antigen purity, surpassing the apparent 82% purity achieved by assigning antigens to the same B cells using fluorescently labeled DTP antigen probes. Moreover, antibodies within certain clusters were found to possess neutralizing activity, suggesting that CDR clusters contain epitope-level information. Together, this study offers a simple approach for antigen- and epitope-specific BCR discovery that is reproducible, inexpensive, and applicable to a wide range of antigen targets.</jats:p>

We designed a prospective, single-center, superiority randomized controlled trial to compare the cost-effectiveness of mNGS with traditional methods for diagnosing CNSIs using a decision tree model. A total of 204 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either the mNGS group or the traditional method group. The two groups of patients entered different decision points according to different clinical manifestations and examination results. They will be then given treatment decisions by a panel of specialists at the corresponding decision point. The primary outcome is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the increased cost for every 1% increase in recovery rate.

            Coral bleaching has been rapidly increasing in recent years due to abnormally elevated temperature, leading to massive damage to coral reefs worldwide. Understanding the processes and micro-ecological mechanisms of coral symbionts in response to bleaching is crucial as evidence accumulates that micro-organisms (particularly the bacteria) contribute to the health and recovery of coral, especially during heat stress. However, the exact functional mechanism of bacteria has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we performed metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses of healthy and bleached
            <jats:italic>Acropora muricata</jats:italic>
            corals to identify taxonomic and functional shifts in coral symbionts during a natural thermal bleaching event on Hainan Island. The results showed that symbiont species tended to be more abundant in bleached corals than healthy corals, and the bacterial community appeared to be crucial to coral bleaching. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens dramatically increased in bleached corals, accompanied by the reduction of beneficial bacteria. In addition, a direct comparison of metagenomic data sets indicated major changes in functional genes, with bleached corals exhibiting significant metabolic enrichment, while healthy corals maintained lower metabolism and energy consumption. Carbohydrate-active enzyme genes were remarkably activated, and virulence factors were highly represented in bleached corals, which was directly related to the increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria. Metaproteomic analysis also demonstrated that bleaching greatly affected photosynthesis and energy metabolism of coral symbionts. Among them, the biological processes of photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis were common in healthy corals, while pathways involved in gluconeogenesis and apoptosis were significantly enriched in bleached corals. Bacteria-mediated processes in healthy corals contribute to maintaining the basic functions of symbionts and resisting stress, whereas the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in bleached corals leads to metabolic abnormalities of symbionts, showing enhanced energy metabolism and catalytic activity. In summary, the two omics analyzes revealed that bleaching caused enormous physiological damage to corals, and bacterial imbalance and dysfunction were the potential micro-ecological mechanisms underlying this event.

            <jats:p>Coral reefs worldwide are facing rapid decline due to coral bleaching. However, knowledge of the physiological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of coral symbionts respond to stress is scarce. Here, metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches were utilized to shed light on the changes in the composition and functions of coral symbiotic bacteria during coral bleaching. The results demonstrated that coral bleaching significantly affected the composition of symbionts, with bacterial communities dominating in bleached corals. Through differential analyses of gene and protein expression, it becomes evident that symbionts experience functional disturbances in response to heat stress. These disturbances result in abnormal energy metabolism, which could potentially compromise the health and resilience of the symbionts. Furthermore, our findings highlighted the highly diverse microbial communities of coral symbionts, with beneficial bacteria providing critical services to corals in stress responses and pathogenic bacteria driving coral bleaching. This study provides comprehensive insights into the complex response mechanisms of coral symbionts under heat stress from the micro-ecological perspective and offers fundamental data for future monitoring of coral health.</jats:p>

              M9 originated from human breast milk, were able to decrease blood pressure, and modified metabolites in a high fructose-induced elevated blood pressure mouse model. Moreover, we found there was a close relationship between unexplored gut microbes and elevated blood pressure. Also, subsequently, the cross-link was explored among gut microbes, metabolites, and some metabolic pathways in gut microbial environment through introducing novel prediction methodology and bioinformatic analysis. It allowed us to hypothesize that probiotics can prevent elevated blood pressure via gut microbiota and related metabolism.Thus, utilization of dietary strategies (such as probiotics) to maintain the blood pressure level is of crucial importance.

          <jats:p>
            Crohn’s disease (CD) is a presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that manifests in childhood and adolescence and involves chronic and severe enterocolitis, immune and gut microbial dysregulation, and other complications. Diet and gut-microbiota-produced metabolites are sources of anti-inflammatories that could ameliorate symptoms. However, questions remain on how IBD influences biogeographic patterns of microbial location and function in the gut, how early life transitional gut communities are affected by IBD and diet interventions, and how disruption to biogeography alters disease mediation by diet components or microbial metabolites. Many studies on diet and IBD use a chemically induced ulcerative colitis model, despite the availability of an immune-modulated CD model. Interleukin-10-knockout (IL-10-KO) mice on a C57BL/6 background, beginning at age 4 or 7 weeks, were fed a control diet or one containing 10% (wt/wt) raw broccoli sprouts, which was high in the sprout-sourced anti-inflammatory sulforaphane. Diets began 7 days prior to, and for 2 weeks after inoculation with
            <jats:italic>Helicobacter hepaticus,</jats:italic>
            which triggers Crohn’s-like symptoms in these immune-impaired mice. The broccoli sprout diet increased sulforaphane in plasma; decreased weight stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea associated; and increased microbiota richness in the gut, especially in younger mice. Sprout diets resulted in some anatomically specific bacteria in younger mice and reduced the prevalence and abundance of pathobiont bacteria which trigger inflammation in the IL-10-KO mouse, for example,
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Helicobacter</jats:italic>
            . Overall, the IL-10-KO mouse model is responsive to a raw broccoli sprout diet and represents an opportunity for more diet-host-microbiome research.

            <jats:title>IMPORTANCE</jats:title>
            <jats:p>To our knowledge, IL-10-KO mice have not previously been used to investigate the interactions of host, microbiota, and broccoli, broccoli sprouts, or broccoli bioactives in resolving symptoms of CD. We showed that a diet containing 10% raw broccoli sprouts increased the plasma concentration of the anti-inflammatory compound sulforaphane and protected mice to varying degrees against disease symptoms, including weight loss or stagnation, fecal blood, and diarrhea. Younger mice responded more strongly to the diet, further reducing symptoms, as well as increased gut bacterial richness, increased bacterial community similarity to each other, and more location-specific communities than older mice on the diet intervention. Crohn’s disease disrupts the lives of patients and requires people to alter dietary and lifestyle habits to manage symptoms. The current medical treatment is expensive with significant side effects, and a dietary intervention represents an affordable, accessible, and simple strategy to reduce the burden of symptoms.</jats:p>

            Depression is an individual risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). Recent studies show that gut microbiota and metabolites play a critical role in comorbid HF and depressive symptoms. We recruited 95 subjects including 35 HF patients with depressive symptoms (HF-DS), 36 HF patients without depressive symptoms (HF-NDS), and 24 healthy controls (HC). The 16S rRNA, metagenome sequencing, and untargeted metabolomic analysis were employed to test fecal samples. Our analysis found a significant difference in composition of gut microbiota in HF-DS, HF-NDS, and HC populations. At the genus level,

Furthermore, anti-inflammatory mediators (abietic acid, quinic acid, linoleic acid, etc.) and neurotransmitters (catechin, serotonin, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, etc.) were reduced in HF-DS. The enrichment analysis revealed that the gut microbiota highly conformed to the functional pathways of metabolites, and amino acid-related metabolism, fatty acid-related metabolism, and cAMP signaling pathways may be crucial biological mechanisms involved in the development of comorbid depression and HF. Finally,

We initiated a complete characterization of five strains belonging to five species with a long history of safe use in food:

            living cells showed a clear reduction in mouse sensitivity to colitis
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Interestingly, we observed that
            <jats:italic>C. jadinii</jats:italic>

            was unable to efficiently adhere to epithelial cells and did not survive more than 24 to 48 h in the gut. Transcriptomic analysis using NanoString technology suggested a potential role of IL-8 through Mif and Fkbp5 in the effect of
            <jats:italic>C. jadinii</jats:italic>

            Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has the potential to provide bacterial strain-level resolution which is of key importance to tackle a host of clinical questions. While bioinformatic tools that achieve strain-level resolution are available, thorough benchmarking is needed to validate their use for less investigated and low biomass microbiomes like those from the upper respiratory tract. We analyzed a previously published data set of longitudinally collected nasopharyngeal samples from Bangladeshi infants (Microbiota and Health study) and a novel data set of oropharyngeal samples from Swiss children with cystic fibrosis. Data from bacterial cultures were used for benchmarking the parameters of StrainPhlAn 3, a bioinformatic tool designed for strain-level resolution. In addition, StrainPhlAn 3 results were compared with metagenomic assemblies derived from StrainGE and newly derived whole-genome sequencing data. After optimizing the analytical parameters, we compared StrainPhlAn 3 results to culture gold standard methods and achieved sensitivity values of 87% (

            <jats:p>The usage of 16S rRNA gene sequencing has become the state-of-the-art method for the characterization of the microbiota in health and respiratory disease. The method is reliable for low biomass samples due to prior amplification of the 16S rRNA gene but has limitations as species and certainly strain identification is not possible. However, the usage of metagenomic tools for the analyses of microbiome data from low biomass samples is not straight forward, and careful optimization is needed. In this work, we show that by validating StrainPhlAn 3 results with the data from bacterial cultures, the strain-level tracking of the respiratory microbiome is feasible despite the high content of host DNA being present when parameters are carefully optimized to fit low biomass microbiomes. This work further proposes that strain retention analyses are feasible, at least for more abundant species. This will help to better understand the longitudinal dynamics of the upper respiratory microbiome during health and disease.</jats:p>

            Chronic polymicrobial infections (cPMIs) harbor complex bacterial communities with diverse metabolic capacities, leading to competitive and cooperative interactions. Although the microbes present in cPMIs have been established through culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, the key functions that drive different cPMIs and the metabolic activities of these complex communities remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 102 published metatranscriptomes collected from cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum and chronic wound infections (CW) to identify key bacterial members and functions in cPMIs. Community composition analysis identified a high prevalence of pathogens, particularly
            <jats:italic>Staphylococcus</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>

            . Functional profiling with HUMANn3 and SAMSA2 revealed that while functions involved in bacterial competition, oxidative stress response, and virulence were conserved across both chronic infection types, &gt;40% of the functions were differentially expressed. Higher expression of antibiotic resistance and biofilm functions was observed in CF, while tissue-destructive enzymes and oxidative stress response functions were highly expressed in CW samples. Of note, strict anaerobes had negative correlations with traditional pathogens in both CW and CF samples, and they significantly contributed to the expression of these functions. Additionally, we show that microbial communities have unique expression patterns, and distinct organisms fulfill the expression of key functions in each site, indicating that the infection environment strongly influences bacterial physiology and that community structure influences function. Collectively, our findings indicate that community composition and function should guide treatment strategies for cPMIs.

            <jats:p>The microbial diversity in polymicrobial infections (PMIs) allows for community members to establish interactions with one another, which can result in enhanced disease outcomes such as increased antibiotic tolerance and chronicity. Chronic PMIs result in large burdens on health systems, as they affect a significant proportion of the population and are expensive and difficult to treat. However, investigations into physiology of microbial communities in actual human infection sites are lacking. Here, we highlight that the predominant functions in chronic PMIs differ, and anaerobes, often described as bystanders, may be significant in the progression of chronic infections. Determining the community structure and functions in PMIs is a critical step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that increase the virulence potential of the microbial community in these environments.</jats:p>

            Social and economic inequities can have a profound impact on human health, particularly on the development and progression of chronic disease. For military veterans, exposure to unique environments and circumstances may further impact their health. There continues to be limited work regarding the influence of mental health within the context of socioeconomic inequities. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that veterans residing in food deserts (e.g., places in which there is a lack of access to sufficient and/or nutritious food) would have decreased gut microbial species (α-diversity), different microbiome community compositions, and poorer quality of diet and mental health compared to non-food desert residents. The fecal microbiome of 342 military veterans was sequenced, and microbiome diversity and community composition were evaluated. Although dietary quality and α-diversity did not significantly differ by food desert status, resident status (food desert versus non-food desert) accounted for a moderate influence on β-diversity (2.4%). Factors such as race and psychiatric diagnoses accounted for greater proportions of β-diversity influence (7% and 10%, respectively). Moreover, more participants with current post-traumatic stress disorder lived in food deserts (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.04), and there were significantly more participants in the non-food desert group diagnosed with substance use disorders (

            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.04). These findings suggest that living in a food desert, in combination with additional associated risk factors, may influence gut microbial diversity and composition. To increase ecological validity, researchers investigating the influence of inter-related biopsychosocial factors over time may benefit from adopting a life-course perspective.

            <jats:p>Social and economic inequities can have a profound impact on human health. The inequities could result in alterations to the gut microbiome, an important factor that may have profound abilities to alter health outcomes. Moreover, the strong correlations between social and economic inequities have been long understood. However, to date, limited research regarding the microbiome and mental health within the context of socioeconomic inequities exists. One particular inequity that may influence both mental health and the gut microbiome is living in a food desert. Persons living in food deserts may lack access to sufficient and/or nutritious food and often experience other inequities, such as increased exposure to air pollution and poor access to healthcare. Together, these factors may confer a unique risk for microbial perturbation. Indeed, external factors beyond a food desert might compound over time to have a lasting effect on an individual’s gut microbiome. Therefore, adoption of a life-course approach is expected to increase the ecological validity of research related to social inequities, the gut microbiome, and physical and mental health.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Corticosteroids have become a choice for managing severe COVID-19, but the molecular mechanisms behind the response after corticosteroid administration remain incompletely understood. In order to unravel this, comparisons between temporal metabolic profiles in the plasma samples of methylprednisolone (MP)- and placebo-treated COVID-19 patients were performed at different time points. The patient plasma samples used were obtained from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial performed on severe COVID-19 patients in the Brazilian Amazon, where the patients received placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MP intravenously twice daily for 5 days. The MP treatment reduced the number of metabolites in the plasma of patients during follow-up. The longitudinal changes in the MP group were in eight metabolic pathways related to steroid hormones and eicosanoids. Direct comparison between the two groups, revealed differences at baseline, which peaked 5 days after initiation of MP treatment. The metabolic pathways differing between the two groups over time included galactose metabolism, glucose and gluconeogenesis, N-glycan metabolism, and prostaglandin formation from arachidonate. Deoxy-galactose, prostaglandin H2, sphingosine, and sphinganine exhibited differential trajectories by day 14 after initiating the MP treatment. Survival of MP-treated COVID-19 patients was associated with modulation of tryptophan metabolism and diminished levels of oxidized glutathione. Network analysis revealed that MP treatment is highly associated with alterations in pathways reflecting eicosanoid metabolism, such as arachidonic acid and prostaglandins. Curiously, there is a crosstalk between metabolomics, biochemistry, and cytokine components. Treatment of systemic and inflammatory conditions induced by SARS-CoV-2 viral infections with methylprednisolone modulates metabolic activity associated with tryptophan and inflammatory lipids.</jats:p>

            The postpartum period represents a dynamic time for women’s health, particularly when it comes to changes in weight, which can disproportionately affect Latina women. Weight change, particularly weight gain, has been associated with pronounced changes in host gut microbiome profiles and composition. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the gut microbiome among Latina mothers who gained or lost weight in the first 6 months after delivery by characterizing changes in gut microbial co-occurrence networks, alpha- and beta-diversity measures, and relative abundances of bacterial taxa. This study characterized the gut microbiomes of 105 Latina mothers at 1 and 6 months postpartum, comparing mothers who gained weight (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>
            -tests. Mothers who gained weight postpartum had significant changes in their co-occurrence network density, alpha- and beta-diversity, and relative abundances of certain microbial taxa compared to those who lost weight. Microbial co-occurrence networks, representing measures of differences in community structure dynamics, of the weight gain group decreased in density by 2%, while there was no change in density in the weight loss group. Additionally, the weight gain group had lower Shannon entropy after 6 months and significant changes in the relative abundances of 17 bacterial families and genera, while there were no significant changes in any of these metrics in the weight loss group.

            <jats:p>Previous research has reported differences in the gut microbiome associated with varying body compositions. More specifically, within populations of mothers, the focus has been on the impact of gestational weight gain. This is the first study to examine postpartum weight change and its association with changes in the gut microbiome, similarly, it is the first to use a Latina cohort to do so. The results support the idea that weight gain may be an important factor in reducing gut microbiome network connectivity, diversity, and changing abundances of specific microbial taxa, all measures thought to impact host health. These results suggest that weight gain dynamically alters mothers’ gut microbial communities in the first 6 months postpartum, with comparatively little change in mothers who lost weight; further research is needed to examine the health consequences of such changes.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Targeted amplicon sequencing is widely used in microbial ecology studies. However, sequencing artifacts and amplification biases are of great concern. To identify sources of these artifacts, a systematic analysis was performed using mock communities comprised of 16S rRNA genes from 33 bacterial strains. Our results indicated that while sequencing errors were generally isolated to low-abundance operational taxonomic units, chimeric sequences were a major source of artifacts. Singleton and doubleton sequences were primarily chimeras. Formation of chimeric sequences was significantly correlated with the GC content of the targeted sequences. Low-GC-content mock community members exhibited lower rates of chimeric sequence formation. GC content also had a large impact on sequence recovery. The quantitative capacity was notably limited, with substantial recovery variations and weak correlation between anticipated and observed strain abundances. The mock community strains with higher GC content had higher recovery rates than strains with lower GC content. Amplification bias was also observed due to the differences in primer affinity. A two-step PCR strategy reduced the number of chimeric sequences by half. In addition, comparative analyses based on the mock communities showed that several widely used sequence processing pipelines/methods, including DADA2, Deblur, UCLUST, UNOISE, and UPARSE, had different advantages and disadvantages in artifact removal and rare species detection. These results are important for improving sequencing quality and reliability and developing new algorithms to process targeted amplicon sequences.</jats:p>

            Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a challenging gastrointestinal disease that disproportionately affects premature neonates, with high incidence and case-fatality rates. Despite extensive research efforts, the pathogenesis and mechanisms of NEC remain unclear, making it difficult to effectively eradicate. However, it has been established that dysbiosis of gut microbes occurs before the onset of NEC, providing compelling evidence for the potential use of probiotic therapy. As such, we have focused our attention on two probiotics in particular:
            <jats:italic>Clostridium butyricum</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Clostridium tyrobutyricum</jats:italic>
            , especially in light of recent breakthroughs that have linked several
            <jats:italic>Clostridia</jats:italic>
            species with NEC. To determine whether
            <jats:italic>C. butyricum</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>C. tyrobutyricum</jats:italic>
            are pathogenic or probiotic, we conducted a comparison of the phenotypic traits of NEC mice treated with each bacterium. Our results confirm that treatment with
            <jats:italic>C. tyrobutyricum</jats:italic>
            restores intestinal barrier integrity and alleviates inflammatory immune responses associated with NEC. In contrast, treatment with
            <jats:italic>C. butyricum</jats:italic>
            exacerbates intestinal barrier damage and promotes immune disorder, including increased numbers of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils in the intestinal lamina propria. Further analysis of the gut microbiome suggests that the positive effects of
            <jats:italic>C. tyrobutyricum</jats:italic>
            treatment are associated with an increase in

            <jats:italic>A. muciniphila</jats:italic>
            , a gut microbe that is closely associated with intestinal homeostasis. In summary, by improving the abundance of

          <jats:p>Corals rely on a wide range of microorganisms for their functioning, including intracellular dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) and bacteria. Marine heatwaves trigger the loss of Symbiodiniaceae from coral tissues–coral bleaching–often leading to death. While coral-bacteria interactions are widely studied, Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions have remained largely uninvestigated. Here, we provide a genomic analysis of 49 bacteria, spanning 16 genera, that are closely associated with six cultured Symbiodiniaceae species. We analyzed bacterial functional potential by focusing on potentially beneficial functions for the Symbiodiniaceae host, including B vitamin synthesis and antioxidant abilities, which may be crucial for Symbiodiniaceae heat tolerance and, in turn, coral resistance to thermal bleaching. These analyses suggest a wide potential for B vitamin synthesis and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (through the production of carotenoids or antioxidant enzymes), and possibly the transfer of organic carbon to host cells. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis between bacteria isolated from wild-type and heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae cultures revealed that exposure to long-term elevated temperature has resulted in mutations in genes known to be involved in host-symbiont interactions, such as secretion systems. Climate change may therefore modify how Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria interact. This study provides an overview of the possible roles of Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacteria in Symbiodiniaceae functioning and heat tolerance, reinforcing the need for further studies of such interactions to fully understand coral biology and climate resilience.</jats:p>

By assessing the genomic potential of 49 bacteria, we found that they are likely beneficial for Symbiodiniaceae, through the production of B vitamins and antioxidants.

            <jats:p>Our study investigated how a traditional drink called Apong, made from fermented rice, affects the gut and health of the Mishing community in India. We compared two groups of people who drink Apong to a group of people who do not drink it. To accomplish this, we studied the gut bacteria, fecal metabolites, and blood samples of the participants. It was found that the people who drank Apong had higher blood pressure but lower blood sugar and protein levels than people who did not drink it. We also found that the gut microbiome composition of people who drank Apong was different from those who did not drink it. Moreover, people who drank Apong had lower levels of isovaleric acid in their feces. Overall, this study shows that a traditional drink like Apong can affect the gut bacteria of a community.</jats:p>

              Lyme disease is often treated using long courses of antibiotics, which can cause side effects for patients and risks the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Narrow-spectrum antimicrobials would reduce these risks, but their development has been slow because the Lyme disease bacterium,

Here, we present a novel example: a web application called Rocket-miR that applies an existing bioinformatic algorithm (IntaRNA) to predict cross-species miRNA-mRNA interactions and identify human miRNAs with potential antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Rocket-miR is the logical extension of our prior finding that human miRNA let-7b-5p impairs the ability of the ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen

            to form biofilms and resist the bactericidal effect of β-lactam antibiotics. Rocket-miR’s point and click interface enables researchers without programming expertise to predict additional human-miRNA-pathogen interactions. Identified miRNAs can be developed into novel antimicrobials effective against the 24 clinically relevant pathogens, implicated in diseases of the lung, gut, and other organs, that are included in the application. The paper incorporates three case studies contributed by microbiologists that study human pathogens to demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the application.

The application’s target audience are microbiologists that have the laboratory resources to test the application’s predictions. The Rocket-miR application currently supports 24 recognized human pathogens that are relevant to numerous diseases including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), urinary tract infections, and pneumonia.

            The organic pollutant-degrading microorganisms with high cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) are generally favorable due to the positive role of high CSH in pollutant capture and cell colonization. Sphingomonads, an important bacterial group with metabolic versatility, have significant potential for biodegradation and bioremediation of organic pollutants and generally harbor higher CSH than typical Gram-negative bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their high CSH are still unclear. In this study,

            C1, the most hydrophobic sphingomonad ever known, and its hydrophilic variant C2 were used to identify the genome variations responsible for the CSH difference by comparative genome and transcriptome analysis, as well as gene knockout verification. Our results indicated that the high CSH of strain C1 was largely attributed to the low copy number of the native plasmid p3, which mainly affected the transcriptional levels of outer membrane protein genes through direct and indirect means. In addition, loss of the genes on the native plasmid p5 involved in polysaccharide synthesis and secretion could increase CSH and cell surface friction. The bioinformatics analysis further revealed that some sphingomonad genomes also contained the long homologous fragments and/or key genes of p3 and p5. This study demonstrated the important role of native plasmids in regulating the CSH of sphingomonads, suggesting a novel CSH regulation strategy and evolution process.

            Bacterial mRNA sequencing is inefficient due to the abundance of ribosomal RNA that is challenging to deplete. While commercial kits target rRNA from common bacterial species, they are frequently inefficient when applied to divergent species, including those from environmental isolates. Similarly, other methods typically employ large probe sets that tile the entire length of rRNAs; however, such approaches are infeasible when applied to many species. Therefore, we present EMBR-seq+, which requires fewer than 10 oligonucleotides per rRNA by combining rRNA blocking primers with RNase H-mediated depletion to achieve rRNA removal efficiencies of up to 99% in diverse bacterial species. Furthermore, in more complex microbial co-cultures between
            <jats:italic>Fibrobacter succinogenes</jats:italic>
            strain UWB7 and anaerobic fungi, EMBR-seq+ depleted both bacterial and fungal rRNA, with a fourfold improvement in bacterial rRNA depletion compared with a commercial kit, thereby demonstrating that the method can be applied to non-model microbial mixtures. Notably, for microbes with unknown rRNA sequences, EMBR-seq+ enables rapid iterations in probe design without requiring to start experiments from total RNA. Finally, efficient depletion of rRNA enabled systematic quantification of the reprogramming of the bacterial transcriptome when cultured in the presence of the anaerobic fungi
            <jats:italic>Anaeromyces robustus</jats:italic>

Thus, EMBR-seq+ enables efficient, cost-effective, and rapid quantification of the transcriptome to gain insights into non-model microbial systems.

Recently developed methods for sequencing bacterial mRNA typically rely on depleting rRNA by tiling large probe sets against rRNAs; however, such approaches are expensive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale to varied bacterial species and complex microbial communities. Therefore, we developed EMBR-seq+, a method that requires fewer than 10 short oligonucleotides per rRNA to achieve up to 99% rRNA depletion in diverse bacterial species.

            The iron-oxidizing Gallionellaceae drive a wide variety of biogeochemical cycles through their metabolisms and biominerals. To better understand the environmental impacts of Gallionellaceae, we need to improve our knowledge of their diversity and metabolisms, especially any novel iron oxidation mechanisms. Here, we used a pangenomic analysis of 103 genomes to resolve Gallionellaceae phylogeny and explore their genomic potential. Using a concatenated ribosomal protein tree and key gene patterns, we determined Gallionellaceae has four genera, divided into two groups: iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB)

            <jats:italic>nxr</jats:italic>
            . The FeOB and NOB have similar electron transport chains, including genes for reverse electron transport and carbon fixation. Auxiliary energy metabolisms, including S oxidation, denitrification, and organotrophy, were scattered throughout the FeOB. Within FeOB, we found genes that may represent adaptations for iron oxidation, including a variety of extracellular electron uptake mechanisms. FeOB genomes encoded more predicted
            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>

MHCs efficiently conduct electrons across longer distances and function across a wide range of redox potentials that overlap with mineral redox potentials, which can expand the range of usable iron substrates. Overall, the results of pangenome analyses suggest that the Gallionellaceae genera

To fully understand environmental microbial iron oxidation, we need a thorough accounting of iron oxidation mechanisms. In this study, we show the Gallionellaceae FeOB genomes encode both characterized iron oxidases as well as uncharacterized multiheme cytochromes (MHCs). MHCs are predicted to transfer electrons from extracellular substrates and likely confer metabolic capabilities that help Gallionellaceae occupy a range of different iron- and mineral-rich niches. Gallionellaceae appear to specialize in iron oxidation, so it would be advantageous for them to have multiple mechanisms to oxidize various forms of iron, given the many iron minerals on Earth, as well as the physiological and kinetic challenges faced by FeOB. The multiple iron/mineral oxidation mechanisms may help drive the widespread ecological success of Gallionellaceae.</jats:p>

            discovery methods are essential tools for therapeutic target identification in complex interphylum interactions such as arthropods and mammals. Notably, the methods should ideally be species agnostic, showing unique features of all interacting species. We evaluated the possibilities for matrix-assisted desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI, referred to here as MSI) as a spatial “omics” method to simultaneously profile both an arthropod vector (
            <jats:italic>Ixodes</jats:italic>
            tick) and a mammalian skin (guinea pig) in a bite model. We demonstrated the feasibility of MSI using gelatin-stabilized sample mounting that allowed for serial sectioning and mapping lipids in control and bitten skin, including the tick body and embedded mouthparts. We identified unique lipid ion patterns and observed lipid reorganization beneath the bite site consistent with histological changes. Furthermore, several ions were observed in the tick body with lower intensity in the dermis and control skin, suggesting the transmission of lipids from the tick to mammalian skin. These results establish a multi-system approach for discovering cross-species molecular interactions that can be further developed as targets to disrupt the vector-host interface.

Here, we used an ensemble of machine-learning (ML) models and studied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from 4,099 gut microbiome samples representing 12 prospectively collected infant cohorts. We chose the childbirth delivery mode as a starting point for such analysis because it has previously been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome in infants. In cross-study ensemble models, Bacteroides was the most important feature in all machine-learning models. The predictive capacity by taxonomy varied with age. At the age of 1–2 months, gut microbiome data were able to predict delivery mode with an area under the curve of 0.72 to 0.83. In contrast, ML models trained on taxa were not able to differentiate between the modes of delivery, in any of the cohorts, when the infants were between 3 and 12 months of age. Moreover, no ML model, alternately trained on the functional pathways of the infant gut microbiome, could consistently predict mode of delivery at any infant age.

In this study, through high-throughput screening, we found that tafenoquine (TAF), an antimalarial agent, exhibited antimicrobial efficacy against MRSA and its highly resistant phenotypes of biofilm and persister cells. No resistant mutation emerged by consecutive sub-minimal inhibitory concentration of TAF induction. Mechanistic studies by fluorescent probes of SYTOX Green/DiSC3(5), molecular dynamic simulations, electron microscopy, and proteomic analysis revealed that TAF exerts antimicrobial activity mainly through selective bacterial cell membrane disruption. In addition, TAF exhibited an effective antimicrobial effect in a subcutaneous abscess model

            The diamondback moth (DBM),
            <jats:italic>Plutella xylostella,</jats:italic>
            has successfully adapted to the potent chemical defenses of Brassicaceae plants that deter most other herbivores. Gut bacteria are increasingly recognized as key to the biology of many species but their role in DBM adaptation to plant defense compounds is not well known. In this study, the secondary metabolites of radish seedlings, rich in flavonoids, were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These secondary metabolites reduced the larval growth of DBM lacking gut bacteria. The effect was rapidly eclipsed by the re-introduction of gut microbiota, which was dominated by
            <jats:italic>Enterobacter</jats:italic>
            (Proteobacteria). Similarly, while treatment with the flavonoid kaempferol adversely affected growth and extended the development time, these were alleviated by the re-introduction of
            <jats:italic>Enterobacter</jats:italic>
            sp. EbPXG5 (EbPXG5) to the DBM gut. EbPXG5 not only degrades kaempferol both
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and DBM gut, but is also shown to colonize the gut epithelium, forming a protective biofilm. Genomic sequencing of EbPXG5 showed that metabolic genes were the most abundant, especially those involved in xenobiotic degradation, and the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, which could participate in the degradation of plant secondary metabolites such as kaempferol. Overall, our results showed that EbPXG5 is a bacterium common in the gut of DBM larvae and has the

            capacity to detoxify a major secondary metabolite that is produced in brassica plants as a defense against herbivores. This insect-bacterial association may be an important contributor to the status of DBM as a major pest of brassica crops worldwide.

EbPXG5, improved insect performance by degrading kaempferol. This bacterium was common in the larval gut of DBM, lining the epithelium as a protective film.

              Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a significant global challenge, with an estimated 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The emergence of AMR is mainly attributed to mobile genetic elements (MGEs or mobilomes), which accelerate wide dissemination among pathogens. The interaction between mobilomes and AMR genes (or resistomes) in

The available fragmented or incomplete genomes remain a significant limitation in investigating the relationship between AMR and MGEs. Here, we collected the most extensive closed

            ) is a major cause of seafood-related gastroenteritis. A pandemic strain, RIMD2210633 (RIMD), has emerged from ancestors due to virulence mechanisms acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Mobile genetic elements play an essential role in RIMD pathogenicity, but they evolve rapidly and are challenging for sequence-based homology detection and functional inference. Guided by the Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains (ECOD), we utilized structure-assisted homology detection of high-quality AlphaFold models for RIMD proteins to augment their functional interpretation. This approach detected 7,107 domains from 3,970 RIMD proteins and classified them into the ECOD hierarchy, providing functional insights into 80% of the proteome. RIMD proteins originating from HGT were identified by comparison against 86 complete proteomes of other
            <jats:italic>Vpar</jats:italic>
            strains. The resulting RIMD mobilome is enriched with phage markers and bacterial defense domains. Evolutionary classification of known HGT proteins suggests they provide selective advantages against the human host, phage, and other stresses. Compared to a pre-pandemic strain, we found fast-evolving proteins with potential involvement in RIMD virulence and phage avoidance. These findings provide vital insights into bacterial evolution, pathogenic mechanisms, and adaptation strategies while offering testable hypotheses for experimental studies and an online resource for future investigation of the RIMD proteome.

              strain RIMD causes seafood-borne illness worldwide. Previous comparative genomic studies have revealed pathogenicity islands in RIMD that contribute to the success of the strain in infection. However, not all virulence determinants have been identified, and many of the proteins encoded in known pathogenicity islands are of unknown function. Based on the EOCD database, we used evolution-based classification of structure models for the RIMD proteome to improve our functional understanding of virulence determinants acquired by the pandemic strain. We further identify and classify previously unknown mobile protein domains as well as fast evolving residue positions in structure models that contribute to virulence and adaptation with respect to a pre-pandemic strain. Our work highlights key contributions of phage in mediating seafood born illness, suggesting this strain balances its avoidance of phage predators with its successful colonization of human hosts.

            Photosynthesis (PS) in purple non-Sulfur bacteria (PNSB) is strictly controlled to avoid energy consumption and to prevent oxidative stress when oxygen is present. PpsR, a transcriptional repressor encoded in the photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC), is one of the main players in the regulation of PS-related genes. In some cases, PpsR does not sense the environmental cue by itself but delegates this task to other proteins like PpaA/AerR anti-repressors, which can ultimately affect PpsR affinity to some promoter regions. In this work, the effects of locus Rru_A0625 product (HP1) on PS regulation of

            gene, just like other PpaA/AerR members, and its deletion annuls pigment synthesis in dark micro/anaerobic growth conditions. HP1 shows similarity to PpaA/AerR anti-repressors family, although it does not possess their typical cobalamin binding domain. A transcriptomic analysis of Rru_A0625 deletion mutant showed that HP1 not only has effects on bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, but also many other biological processes in the cell. The most notorious is the impact on the transcription of the nitrogenase complex components and accessory proteins. Our results suggest that this new member of the PpaA/AerR family has evolved losing the canonical cobalamin binding domain, but not the redox sensing capability, conserving a not fully understood mechanism of PS regulation.

              vast metabolic versatility places it as a remarkable model bacterium and an excellent biotechnological chassis. The key component of photosynthesis (PS) studied in this work (HP1) stands out among the other members of PpaA/AerR anti-repressor family since it lacks the motif they all share: the cobalamin B-12 binding motif. Despite being reduced and poorly conserved, HP1 stills controls PS as the other members of the family, allowing a fast response to changes in the redox state of the cell. This work also shows that HP1 absence affects genes from relevant biological processes other than PS, including nitrogen fixation and stress response. From a biotechnological perspective, HP1 could be manipulated in approaches where PS is not necessary, such as hydrogen or polyhydroxyalkanoates production, to save energy.

            Adaptive evolutionary changes can precede the ecological changes in the gut microbial communities under constant host selection pressure, yet their association with host diseased status was underexplored. Explore shared disease-associated single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in gut microbes spanning diverse human diseases. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,711 gut metagenomic samples from 16 case-control studies spanning 12 human diseases and included an additional 446-member cohort for validation. Overall, healthy individuals carried more mutated resident gut microbes, and more SNVs, mainly involving the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria. Furthermore, the widespread differences in base variant bias of gut microbes were observed between healthy and nonhealthy subjects suggesting divergent gut microbial evolutionary directions under different host medical conditions. We further found that nonsynonymous SNVs can lead to the loss of function of four SCFA-production genes in nonhealthy populations, among which two genes (i.e.,

Our study highlights the importance of employing the genetic variability in gut microbiome to characterize the gut microbial adaptation that can also predict human chronic diseases.

Interestingly, we preliminarily found a few genetic biomarkers on SCFA production can cover most chronic diseases involved in the meta-analysis. In the future, it is of both scientific and clinical significance to further explore the dynamic interactions between adaptive evolution and ecology of gut microbiota associated with host health status.</jats:p>

Here, we present a comprehensive overview of Chloroflexota abundant in WWTPs worldwide, using high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 16S rRNA amplicon data from 740 Danish and global WWTPs. Many novel taxa were described, encompassing 4 families, 13 genera, and 29 novel species. These were widely distributed across most continents, influenced by factors such as climate zone and WWTP process design. Visualization by fluorescence
            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
            hybridization (FISH) confirmed their high abundances in many WWTPs based on the amplicon data and showed a filamentous morphology for nearly all species. Most formed thin and short trichomes integrated into the floc structure, unlikely to form the typical inter-floc bridging that hinders activated sludge floc settling. Metabolic reconstruction of 53 high-quality MAGs, representing most of the novel genera, offered further insights into their versatile metabolisms and suggested a primary role in carbon removal and involvement in nitrogen cycling. The presence of glycogen reserves, detected by FISH-Raman microspectroscopy, seemed widespread across the phylum, demonstrating that these bacteria likely utilize glycogen as energy storage to survive periods with limited resources. This study gives a broad overview of the Chloroflexota community in global activated sludge WWTPs and improves our understanding of their roles in these engineered ecosystems.

            Hard-wired within the genome of a pathogen is the information regarding factors responsible for its pathogenicity. Advances in functional genomics, particularly gene expression analysis, have made possible genome-wide interrogation of a pathogen to decipher pathogenicity-associated genes. Standard protocols assess differential expression of genes during pathogenesis; however, often a conservative approach is taken, which requires expression fold change above an arbitrarily defined threshold and a statistical significance test to infer a gene as differentially expressing. This renders a high-confidence set of differentially expressed genes in pathogenesis, however, at the cost of numerous false negatives. To circumvent this problem and comprehensively catalog pathogenicity-associated genes, we have developed a novel pipeline that uses standard protocol in combination with gene co-expression network of a pathogen constructed using publicly available RNA-Seq data sets.

            Polyolefins derived from plastic wastes are recalcitrant for biological upcycling. However, chemical depolymerization of polyolefins can generate depolymerized plastic (DP) oil, comprising of a complex mixture of saturated, unsaturated, even, and odd hydrocarbons suitable for biological conversion. While DP oil contains a rich carbon and energy source, it is inhibitory to cells. Understanding and harnessing robust metabolic capabilities of microorganisms to upcycle the hydrocarbons in DP oil, both naturally and unnaturally occurring, into high-value chemicals are limited. Here, we discovered that an oleaginous yeast,
            <jats:italic>Yarrowia lipolytica,</jats:italic>
            undergoing short-term adaptation to DP oil robustly utilized a wide range of hydrocarbons for cell growth and production of citric acid and neutral lipids. When growing on hydrocarbons,
            <jats:italic>Y. lipolytica</jats:italic>
            partitioned into planktonic and oil-bound cells with each exhibiting distinct proteomes and amino acid distributions invested in establishing these proteomes. Significant proteome reallocation toward energy and lipid metabolism, belonging to 2 of the 23 Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups classes C and I, enabled robust growth of
            <jats:italic>Y. lipolytica</jats:italic>
            on hydrocarbons, with n-hexadecane as the preferential substrate. This investment was even higher for growth on DP oil where classes C and I were ranked one and two, respectively, and many associated proteins and pathways were expressed and upregulated including the hydrocarbon degradation pathway, Krebs cycle, glyoxylate shunt and, unexpectedly, propionate metabolism. However, a reduction in proteome allocation for protein biosynthesis, at the expense of the observed increase toward energy and lipid metabolisms, might have caused the inhibitory effect of DP oil on cell growth.

              Sustainable processes for biological upcycling of plastic wastes in a circular bioeconomy are needed to promote decarbonization and reduce environmental pollution due to increased plastic consumption, incineration, and landfill storage. Strain characterization and proteomic analysis revealed the robust metabolic capabilities of
              <jats:italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</jats:italic>
              to upcycle polyethylene into high-value chemicals. Significant proteome reallocation toward energy and lipid metabolisms was required for robust growth on hydrocarbons with n-hexadecane as the preferential substrate. However, an apparent over-investment in these same categories to utilize complex depolymerized plastic (DP) oil came at the expense of protein biosynthesis, limiting cell growth. Taken together, this study elucidates how

            Microbes typically reside in communities containing multiple species, whose interactions have considerable impacts on the robustness and functionality of such communities. To manage microbial communities, it is essential to understand the factors driving their assemblage and maintenance. Even though the community composition could be easily assessed, interspecies interactions during community establishment remain poorly understood. Here, we combined co-occurrence network analysis with quantitative PCR to examine the importance of each species within synthetic communities (SynComs) of pellicle biofilms. Genome-scale metabolic models and

          <jats:p>The ability to modulate host cell cycle progression is a requirement of many human viruses in order to facilitate their replication and propagation. Nuclear-replicating DNA viruses frequently stall the host cell cycle in G1 to avoid competition with host DNA replication. Among these viruses is human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a prevalent beta-herpesvirus. Here, we discover a pro-viral mechanism that employs the deacetylase activity of the human enzyme sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) for HCMV-mediated cell cycle dysregulation. First, we show that the SIRT2 deacetylase activity supports an early stage of HCMV replication. Focusing on these early infection time points, we next define temporal SIRT2 protein interactions and deacetylation substrates by using mass spectrometry-based interactome and acetylome analyses. We find that SIRT2 interacts with and modulates the acetylation level of cell cycle proteins during infection, including the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Using flow cytometry, cell sorting, and functional assays, we demonstrate that SIRT2 regulates CDK2 K6 acetylation and the G1- to S-phase transition in a manner that supports HCMV replication. Altogether, our findings expand the understanding of mechanisms underlying HCMV-induced cell cycle dysregulation and point toward regulatory feedback between SIRT2 and CDK2 that can have implications in other viral infections and human diseases.</jats:p>

            As the most common approach for the restoration of degraded grasslands, the use of grass-legume mixtures has long been recognized for its role in increasing aboveground biomass and resisting grassland degradation. However, whether the legumes in these mixtures can help neighboring plants resist the decline in biomass caused by the loss of soil microbial diversity remains a question worthy of investigation. To address this, we employed a dilution method to create a gradient of decreasing microbial diversity in soil and utilized full-factorial combinations of legumes and two grasses to investigate the crucial role of legumes in the mixture. The results showed that compared to monoculture, the mixture of
            <jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic>

In addition, the grass-legume mixture increased the deterministic processes of microbial community enrichment in the root zone soil by enhancing the process of homogeneous selection. Functional predictions revealed that grass-legume mixtures increased the potential abundance of N-related and phototrophy-related microbial communities in the root zone soil. This study provides an important insight into the mechanism underlying the role of legumes in increasing and maintaining grass biomass despite soil microbial diversity loss.

              Grass-legume mixtures are a common practice for establishing artificial grasslands, directly or indirectly contributing to the improvement of yield. In addition, this method helps maintain soil and plant health by reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. The impact of grass-legume mixtures on yield and its underlying microbial mechanisms have been a focus of scientific investigation. However, the benefits of mixtures in the context of soil microbial diversity loss remain a problem worthy of exploration. In this study, we examined different aboveground and belowground diversity combinations to elucidate the mechanisms by which grass-legume mixtures help maintain stable yields in the face of diversity loss. We identified the significantly enriched

ASV53 showed a strong positive correlation with biomass and the abundance of nitrogen-fixing genes. These findings provide a new theoretical foundation for utilizing grass-legume mixtures to enhance grass yields and address the challenges posed by diversity loss.

Through genomic study based on a large collection of bacterial complete genomes and further comparative analysis with two prominent MGEs to spread ARGs—conjugative plasmids and class 1 integrons, we, for the first time, demonstrated that ICEs are indeed overlooked “hot” vectors from the aspects of mobility and pathogenicity: (i) ICEs exhibited broader phylogenetic distribution among two dominant phyla with high ARG diversity and (ii) ARG-carrying ICEs were significantly enriched in potential human pathogens covering all the six “ESKAPE” species, of which some displayed typical co-occurrence patterns with ARGs and virulence factors. Moreover, this first genomic comparative study also deciphered the distinct ARG profiles harbored by these three essential MGE groups in terms of diversity and prevalence, with characteristic ARG preference to each MGE group.

However, the comprehensive understanding on ICEs’ ARG profile across the bacterial tree of life is still blurred. Through a genomic study by comparison with two key MGEs, we, for the first time, systematically investigated the ARG profile as well as the host range of ICEs and also explored the MGE-specific potential to facilitate ARG propagation across phylogenetic barriers. These findings could serve as a theoretical foundation for risk assessment of ARGs mediated by distinct MGEs and further to optimize therapeutic strategies aimed at restraining antibiotic resistance crises.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Prokaryotic species are composed of multiple clonal lineages coexisting in the same habitat. In recent years, understanding the maintenance of this high intraspecific genetic diversity in asexual microorganisms has been a challenge for microbial ecology. In this study, we investigated the potential ecological role of this genomic heterogeneity in the marine HIMB59 clade. The metagenomic recruitment revealed the presence of three main genomospecies with different ecological distribution patterns within the two defined families. Genomic analysis revealed the presence of a flexible genomic island conserved throughout the order at the same position in the genome and related to phosphate (P) metabolism. The different versions of this island showed a distribution correlated with the concentration of P in the environment but not with the phylogeny at the genomospecies level. At high P availability (&gt;0.5 µM), HIMB59 cells had only the high-affinity phosphate transporter operon (PstSCAB and PhoU). Under conditions of higher P scarcity (&lt;0.05 µM), the cells presented a higher number of genes for the acquisition of P groups from other sources such as organic molecules and their storage. Additionally, in oligotrophic regions exhibiting extreme P depletion, such as the Mediterranean Sea, we found a second flexible genomic island related to phosphonate catabolism to supply metabolic P requirements. These results suggest that these microbes maintain in natural populations a gene pool with an equivalent biological function that allows them to respond to variations in certain micronutrients, creating ecologically distinct lineages within each species.</jats:p>

At the individual level, these microbes have been subjected to evolutionary constraints that have led to a more efficient use of nutrients, removing non-essential genes named as “streamlining theory.” However, at the population level, they conserve a highly diverse gene pool in flexible genomic islands resulting in polyclonal populations on the same genomic background as an evolutionary response to environmental pressures. Localization of these islands at equivalent positions in the genome facilitates horizontal transfer between clonal lineages. This high level of environmental genomic heterogeneity could explain their cosmopolitan distribution. In the case of the order HIMB59 within the class

            , the pathogen of Lyme disease, differentially produces many outer surface proteins (Osp), some of which represent the most abundant membrane proteins, such as OspA, OspB, and OspC. In cultured bacteria, these proteins can account for a substantial fraction of the total cellular or membrane proteins, posing challenges to the identification and analysis of non-abundant proteins, which could serve as novel pathogen detection markers or as vaccine candidates. Herein, we introduced serial mutations to remove these abundant Osps and generated a

            A high-grain (HG) diet can rapidly lower the rumen pH and thus modify the gastrointestinal microbiome in dairy cattle. Although the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is strongly linked with the gut microbiome, the influences of HG diet on animals’ gut resistome remain largely unexplored. Here, we examined the impact and mechanism of an HG diet on the fecal resistome in dairy cattle by metagenomically characterizing the gut microbiome. Eight lactating Holstein cattle were randomly allocated into two groups and fed either a conventional (CON) or HG diet for 3 weeks. The fecal microbiome and resistome were significantly altered in dairy cattle from HG, demonstrating an adaptive response that peaks at day 14 after the dietary transition. Importantly, we determined that feeding an HG diet specifically elevated the prevalence of resistance to aminoglycosides (0.11 vs 0.24 RPKG,
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05). This diet-induced resistance increase is interrelated with the disproportional propagation of microbes in Lachnospiraceae, indicating a potential reservoir of aminoglycosides resistance. We further showed that the prevalence of acquired resistance genes was also modified by introducing a different diet, likely due to the augmented frequency of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in microbes (CON vs HG: 254 vs 287 taxa) such as Lachnospiraceae. Consequently, we present that diet transition is associated with fecal resistome modification in dairy cattle and an HG diet specifically enriched aminoglycosides resistance that is likely by stimulating microbial LGT.

            <jats:p>The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is one of the most severe threats to public health, and developing novel mitigation strategies deserves our top priority. High-grain (HG) diet is commonly applied in dairy cattle to enhance animals’ performance to produce more high-quality milk. We present that despite such benefits, the application of an HG diet is correlated with an elevated prevalence of resistance to aminoglycosides, and this is a combined effect of the expansion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increased frequency of lateral gene transfer in the fecal microbiome of dairy cattle. Our results provided new knowledge in a typically ignored area by showing an unexpected enrichment of antibiotic resistance under an HG diet. Importantly, our findings laid the foundation for designing potential dietary intervention strategies to lower the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in dairy production.</jats:p>

            Drug addiction can seriously damage human physical and mental health, while detoxification is a long and difficult process. Although studies have reported changes in the oral microbiome of methamphetamine (METH) users, the role that the microbiome plays in the process of drug addiction is still unknown. This study aims to explore the function of the microbiome based on analysis of the variations in the oral microbiome and metabolome of METH users. We performed the 16S rRNA sequencing analysis based on the oral saliva samples collected from 278 METH users and 105 healthy controls (CTL). In addition, the untargeted metabolomic profiling was conducted based on 220 samples. Compared to the CTL group, alpha diversity was reduced in the group of METH users and the relative abundances of

            were significantly decreased. Variations were also detected in oral metabolic pathways, including enhanced tryptophan metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and steroid biosynthesis. Conversely, the metabolic pathways of porphyrin metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate were significantly reduced. It was speculated that four key microbial taxa, i.e.,

            Limited information on the virome and bacterial community hampers our ability to discern systemic ecological risk factors that cause cattle diarrhea, which has become a pressing issue in the control of disease. A total of 110 viruses, 1,011 bacterial genera, and 322 complete viral genomes were identified from 70 sequencing samples mixed with 1,120 fecal samples from 58 farms in northeast China. For the diarrheic samples, the identified virome and bacterial community varied in terms of composition, abundance, diversity, and geographic distribution in relation to different disease-associated ecological factors; the abundance of identified viruses and bacteria was significantly correlated with the host factors of clinical status, cattle type, and age, and with environmental factors such as aquaculture model and geographical location (

A series of significant correlations were observed between the prevalence of individual viruses and the disease-associated ecological factors. A genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed high variability of 10 bovine enteric viruses. The bovine hungarovirus was initially identified in both dairy and beef cattle in China. This study elucidates the fecal virome and bacterial community signatures of cattle affected by diarrhea, and reveals novel disease-associated ecological risk factors, including cattle type, cattle age, aquaculture model, and geographical location.

            Oomycetes are fungus-like eukaryotic microorganisms which can cause catastrophic diseases in many plants. Successful infection of oomycetes depends highly on their effector proteins that are secreted into plant cells to subvert plant immunity. Thus, systematic identification of effectors from the oomycete proteomes remains an initial but crucial step in understanding plant–pathogen relationships. However, the number of experimentally identified oomycete effectors is still limited. Currently, only a few bioinformatics predictors exist to detect potential effectors, and their prediction performance needs to be improved. Here, we used the sequence embeddings from a pre-trained large protein language model (ProtTrans) as input and developed a support vector machine-based method called POOE for predicting oomycete effectors. POOE could achieve a highly accurate performance with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.804 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.893, accuracy = 0.874, precision = 0.777, recall = 0.684, and specificity = 0.936) in the fivefold cross-validation, considerably outperforming various combinations of popular machine learning algorithms and other commonly used sequence encoding schemes. A similar prediction performance was also observed in the independent test. Compared with the existing oomycete effector prediction methods, POOE provided very competitive and promising performance, suggesting that ProtTrans effectively captures rich protein semantic information and dramatically improves the prediction task. We anticipate that POOE can accelerate the identification of oomycete effectors and provide new hints to systematically understand the functional roles of effectors in plant–pathogen interactions.

To shed light on the interplay between circadian clocks and the formation of developmental patterns, we followed the expression of a clock-controlled gene under nitrogen deprivation, at the level of individual cells. Our experiments showed that differentiation into heterocysts took place preferentially within a limited interval of the circadian clock cycle, that gene expression in different vegetative intervals along a developed filament was discoordinated, and that the circadian clock was active in individual heterocysts.

            The swine gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, with multiple exchanges with the host and whose composition is linked to both external and internal factors, such as diet or breed. Diet, probiotic, or prebiotic interventions have been designed to boost beneficial host-microbiota interactions, such as the production of anti-inflammatory molecules, or the fermentation of otherwise undigested resources. In parallel, a smaller microbial population, shared among the same host species, independent of external or internal factors, has been described and defined as the “core microbiota.” Therapies targeting the core microbiota could possibly lead to more precise and long-lasting effects. However, the metabolic role of the porcine core microbiota, especially in relation to the rest of the microbial community, is currently missing. We present here the first dynamic model of the porcine core microbiota, which we used to estimate the core-microbiota metabolite production and to forecast the effect of a synbiotic intervention targeting the core genera of the core microbiota. We developed a community model in which a total of 17 microbial groups were established based on culture-based information of representative species. First, the model parameters were estimated, and the resulting model simulations were compared favorably with
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            experimentation. The model was then used to predict the microbial dynamics of the core and non-core members under different experimental conditions. Therefore, it was able to theorize the main-metabolite core microbiota contribution, hypothesizing that it could be mainly responsible for acetate and propionate, but not for butyrate production.

              experimentations aiming to explore the core microbiota dynamics are technically demanding, expensive, or restricted by ethical considerations. Modeling approaches can be used as an initial exploratory tool to develop hypotheses for targeted experimentation. Our mathematical model provides initial information on the microbial and metabolite dynamics of the core microbiota in relation to diet and therapeutic intervention.

            Microbial diversity plays a vital role in the maintenance of ecosystem functions. However, the current understanding of mechanisms that shape microbial diversity along environmental gradients at broad spatial scales is relatively limited, especially for specific functional groups, such as potential diazotrophs. Here, we conducted an aridity-gradient transect survey from 60 sites across the Tibetan Plateau, the largest alpine ecosystem of the planet, to investigate the ecological processes (e.g., local species pools, community assembly processes, and co-occurrence patterns) that underlie the β-diversity of alpine soil potential diazotrophic communities. We found that aridity strongly and negatively affected the abundance, richness, and β-diversity of soil diazotrophs. Diazotrophs displayed a distance-decay pattern along the aridity gradient, with organisms living in lower aridity habitats having a stronger distance-decay pattern. Arid habitats had lower co-occurrence complexity, including the number of edges and vertices, the average degree, and the number of keystone taxa, as compared with humid habitats. Local species pools explained limited variations in potential diazotrophic β-diversity. In contrast, co-occurrence patterns and stochastic processes (e.g., dispersal limitation and ecological drift) played a significant role in regulating potential diazotrophic β-diversity. The relative importance of stochastic processes and co-occurrence patterns changed with increasing aridity, with stochastic processes weakening whereas that of co-occurrence patterns enhancing. The genera
            <jats:italic>Geobacter</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Paenibacillus</jats:italic>
            were identified as keystone taxa of co-occurrence patterns that are associated with β-diversity. In summary, aridity affects the co-occurrence patterns and community assembly by regulating soil and vegetation characteristics and ultimately shapes the β-diversity of potential diazotrophs. These findings highlight the importance of co-occurrence patterns in structuring microbial diversity and advance the current understanding of mechanisms that drive belowground communities.

            <jats:p>Recent studies have shown that community assembly processes and species pools are the main drivers of β-diversity in grassland microbial communities. However, co-occurrence patterns can also drive β-diversity formation by influencing the dispersal and migration of species, the importance of which has not been reported in previous studies. Assessing the impact of co-occurrence patterns on β-diversity is important for understanding the mechanisms of diversity formation. Our study highlights the influence of microbial co-occurrence patterns on β-diversity and combines the drivers of community β-diversity with drought variation, revealing that drought indirectly affects β-diversity by influencing diazotrophic co-occurrence patterns and community assembly.</jats:p>

            Military veterans account for 8% of homeless individuals living in the United States. To highlight associations between history of homelessness and the gut microbiome, we compared the gut microbiome of veterans who reported having a previous experience of homelessness to those from individuals who reported never having experienced a period of homelessness. Moreover, we examined the impact of the cumulative exposure of prior and current homelessness to understand possible associations between these experiences and the gut microbiome. Microbiome samples underwent genomic sequencing and were analyzed based on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, demographic information, dietary data, and mental health history were collected. A lifetime history of homelessness was found to be associated with alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and healthy eating index compared to those without such a history. In terms of differences in gut microbiota, beta diversity was significantly different between veterans who had experienced homelessness and veterans who had never been homeless (

Here, we employed genome-resolved multi-omics to expand our understanding of methanogenesis in the thawing permafrost peatland of Stordalen Mire in Arctic Sweden. In quadrupling the genomic representation of the site’s methanogens and examining their encoded metabolism, we revealed that nearly 20% of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) encoded the potential for methylotrophic methanogenesis. Further, 27% of the transcriptionally active methanogens expressed methylotrophic genes; for

            , they primarily implicated methyl sulfides and methylamines. In addition to methanogenic methylotrophy, &gt;1,700 bacterial MAGs across 19 phyla encoded anaerobic methylotrophic potential, with expression across 12 phyla. Metabolomic analyses revealed the presence of diverse methylated compounds in the Mire, including some known methylotrophic substrates. Active methylotrophy was observed across all stages of a permafrost thaw gradient in Stordalen, with the most frozen non-methanogenic palsa found to host bacterial methylotrophy and the partially thawed bog and fully thawed fen seen to house both methanogenic and bacterial methylotrophic activities. Methanogenesis across increasing permafrost thaw is thus revised from the sole dominance of hydrogenotrophic production and the appearance of acetoclastic at full thaw to consider the co-occurrence of methylotrophy throughout. Collectively, these findings indicate that methanogenic and bacterial methylotrophy may be an important and previously underappreciated component of carbon cycling and emissions in these rapidly changing wetland habitats.

            The development of cereal crops with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a priority for worldwide agriculture. In addition to conventional plant breeding and genetic engineering, the use of the plant microbiome offers another approach to improving crop NUE.

            lines under sufficient and deficient nitrogen (N). Amplicon sequencing and untargeted gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to characterize the bacterial communities and the root metabolome associated with sorghum genotypes varying in sensitivity to low N. We demonstrated that N stress and sorghum type (energy, sweet, and grain sorghum) significantly impacted the root-associated bacterial communities and root metabolite composition of sorghum. We found a positive correlation between sorghum NUE and bacterial richness and diversity in the rhizosphere. The greater alpha diversity in high NUE lines was associated with the decreased abundance of a dominant bacterial taxon,

            . Multiple strong correlations were detected between root metabolites and rhizosphere bacterial communities in response to low N stress. This indicates that the shift in the sorghum microbiome due to low N is associated with the root metabolites of the host plant. Taken together, our findings suggest that host genetic regulation of root metabolites plays a role in defining the root-associated microbiome of sorghum genotypes differing in NUE and tolerance to low N stress.

Higher methane production occurring near the freshwater boundary with slight salinization (and sulfate incursion) might result from increased sulfate-reducing fermenter and syntrophic populations, which can produce substrates used by methanogens.

            <jats:p>Low-level salinity intrusion could increase CH4 flux in tidal freshwater wetlands, while higher levels of salinization might instead decrease CH4 fluxes. High CH4 emissions in oligohaline sites are concerning because seawater intrusion will cause tidal freshwater wetlands to become oligohaline. Methanogenesis genes alone did not account for landscape patterns of CH4 fluxes, suggesting mechanisms altering methanogenesis, methanotrophy, nitrogen cycling, and ammonium release, and increasing decomposition and syntrophic bacterial populations could contribute to increases in net CH4 flux at oligohaline salinities. Improved understanding of these influences on net CH4 emissions could improve restoration efforts and accounting of carbon sequestration in estuarine wetlands. More pristine reference sites may have older and more abundant organic matter with higher carbon:nitrogen compared to wetlands impacted by agricultural activity and may present different interactions between salinity and CH4. This distinction might be critical for modeling efforts to scale up biogeochemical process interactions in estuarine wetlands.</jats:p>

Untargeted metabolomics analysis of total metabolites extracted at 1 and 4 h post-nitrofurantoin treatment revealed that exposure to the drug caused a delayed effect on the metabolome which was most pronounced after 4 h. Pathway enrichment analysis illustrated that several complex interrelated metabolic pathways related to nitrofurantoin bacterial killing (aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, central carbohydrate metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis) and the development of nitrofurantoin resistance (riboflavin metabolism) were significantly perturbed.

              A quest for novel antibiotics and revitalizing older ones (such as nitrofurantoin) for treatment of difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacterial infections has become increasingly popular. The precise antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin is still not fully understood. Furthermore, although the prevalence of nitrofurantoin resistance remains low currently, the drug’s fast-growing consumption worldwide highlights the need to comprehend the emerging resistance mechanisms. Here, we used multidisciplinary techniques to discern the exact mechanism of nitrofurantoin action and high-level resistance in
              <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              , a common cause of urinary tract infections for which nitrofurantoin is the recommended treatment. We found that the expression of multiple genes related to membrane transport (including active efflux and passive diffusion of drug molecules) and nitroreductase activity was modified in nitrofurantoin-resistant strains, including oqxR, the transcriptional regulator of the oqxAB efflux pump. Furthermore, complex interconnected metabolic pathways that potentially govern the nitrofurantoin-killing mechanisms (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis) and nitrofurantoin resistance (riboflavin metabolism) were significantly inhibited following nitrofurantoin treatment. Our study could help inform the improvement of nitrofuran derivatives, the development of new pharmacophores, or drug combinations to support the resurgence of nitrofurantoin in the management of multidrug resistant

            <jats:italic>Vibrio fischeri</jats:italic>

These genes comprise multiple exopolysaccharide loci that are upregulated and flagellar motility genes that are downregulated, with a consistent decrease in measured swimming motility. Furthermore, we identified genes regulated downstream of the key sensor kinase RscS that are induced independent of the response regulator SypG. Our data suggest that transcriptional regulator VpsR plays a strong role in expression of at least a subset of these genes. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of the genes involved in

We explored whether the effect of antimicrobial treatment is detectable with metagenomic sequencing, and whether AMR genes can be spread and established in unchallenged (not treated with antibiotics) individuals following contact with treated donors, and under various frequencies of interaction. Gut and soil substrate microbiomes were investigated by metagenomic sequencing for bacterial community composition and resistome profiling. We found that tetracycline treatment altered the treated gut microbiome by decreasing bacterial diversity and increasing the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes. Untreated cockroaches that interacted with treated donors also had elevated tetracycline resistance. The levels of resistance differed depending on the magnitude and frequency of donor transfer. Additionally, treated donors showed signs of microbiome recovery due to their interaction with the untreated ones. Similar patterns were also recorded in the soil substrate microbiomes. Our results shed light on how interacting microbiomes facilitate AMR gene transmission to previously unchallenged hosts, a dynamic influenced by the interaction frequencies, using an

              and validate modeling hypotheses. We find that antimicrobial treatment increases the levels of resistance in treated populations. Most importantly, we show that resistance increased in untreated populations after interacting with the treated ones. The level of resistance transmission was affected by the magnitude and frequency of population mixing. Our results highlight the importance of microbial transmission in the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

These patients are prone to acquire bacterial pathogens that persist for many weeks and have the opportunity to evolve within the pulmonary environment.

This has enabled various types of secondary analyses of these genomes, including the measurement of their sequence selection pressure. In this work, we have been able to measure the selective pressure of all the described SARS-CoV-2 genes, even analyzed by sequence regions, and we show how this type of analysis allows us to separate the genes between those subject to positive selection (usually those that code for surface proteins or those exposed to the host immune system) and those subject to negative selection because they require greater conservation of their structure and function. We have also seen that when another gene with an overlapping reading frame appears within a gene sequence, the overlapping sequence between the two genes evolves under a stronger purifying selection than the average of the non-overlapping regions of the main gene.

            Microbes can be found in abundance many kilometers underground. While microbial metabolic capabilities have been examined across different geochemical settings, it remains unclear how changes in subsurface niches affect microbial needs to sense and respond to their environment. To address this question, we examined how microbial extracellular sensor systems vary with environmental conditions across metagenomes at different Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) subsurface sites. Because two-component systems (TCSs) directly sense extracellular conditions and convert this information into intracellular biochemical responses, we expected that this sensor family would vary across isolated oligotrophic subterranean environments that differ in abiotic and biotic conditions. TCSs were found at all six subsurface sites, the service water control, and the surface site, with an average of 0.88 sensor histidine kinases (HKs) per 100 genes across all sites. Abundance was greater in subsurface fracture fluids compared with surface-derived fluids, and candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacteria presented the lowest HK frequencies. Measures of microbial diversity, such as the Shannon diversity index, revealed that HK abundance is inversely correlated with microbial diversity (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>

            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            = 0.82). Taken together, these results implicate the abiotic and biotic properties of an ecological niche as drivers of sensor needs, and they suggest that microbes in environments with large fluctuations in organic nutrients (e.g., lacustrine, terrestrial, and coastal ecosystems) may require greater TCS diversity than ecosystems with low nutrients (e.g., open ocean).

            Aliphatic carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones play diverse roles in microbial adaptation to their microenvironment, from excretion as toxins to adaptive metabolites for membrane fluidity. However, the spatial distribution of these molecules throughout biofilms and how microbes in these environments exchange these molecules remain elusive for many of these bioactive species due to inefficient molecular imaging strategies. Herein, we apply on-tissue chemical derivatization (OTCD) using 4-(2-((4-bromophenethyl)dimethylammonio)ethoxy)benzenaminium dibromide (4-APEBA) on a co-culture of a soil bacterium (

Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), we spatially resolved more than 300 different metabolites containing carbonyl groups within this model system. Various spatial patterns are observable in these species, which indicate possible extracellular or intercellular processes of the metabolites and their up- or downregulation during microbial interaction. The unique chemistry of our approach allowed us to bring additional confidence in accurate carbonyl identification, especially when multiple isomeric candidates were possible, and this provided the ability to generate hypotheses about the potential role of some aliphatic carbonyls in this

              The metabolic profiles within microbial biofilms and interkingdom interactions are extremely complex and serve a variety of functions, which include promoting colonization, growth, and survival within competitive and symbiotic environments. However, measuring and differentiating many of these molecules, especially in an

              fashion, remains a significant analytical challenge. We demonstrate a chemical derivatization strategy that enabled highly sensitive, multiplexed mass spectrometry imaging of over 300 metabolites from a model microbial co-culture. Notably, this approach afforded us to visualize over two dozen classes of ketone-, aldehyde-, and carboxyl-containing molecules, which were previously undetectable from colonies grown on agar. We also demonstrate that this chemical derivatization strategy can enable the discrimination of isobaric and isomeric metabolites without the need for orthogonal separation (e.g., online chromatography or ion mobility). We anticipate that this approach will further enhance our knowledge of metabolic regulation within microbiomes and microbial systems used in bioengineering applications.

          <jats:p>Scientific research output has increased exponentially over the past few decades, but not equally across all fields of study, and we lack clear methods for estimating the size of any given field of research. Understanding how fields grow, change, and are organized is essential to understanding how human resources are allocated to the investigation of scientific problems. In this study, we estimated the size of certain biomedical fields from the number of unique author names appearing in field-relevant publications in the PubMed database. Focusing on microbiology, where the size of fields is often associated with those who work on a particular microbe, we find large differences in the size of its subfields. We found that plotting the number of unique investigators as a function of time can show changes consistent with growing or shrinking fields. In general, the number of unique author names associated with a particular microbe correlated with the number of disease cases attributed to that microbe, suggesting that the microbiology field workforce is deployed in a manner consistent with the medical importance of the microbe in question. We propose that unique author counts can be used to measure the size of the workforce in any given field, analyze the overlap of the workforce between fields, and compare how the workforce correlates to available research funds and the public health burden of a field.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Science and its individual fields are growing at spectacular rates along with the number of papers being generated each year. However, we lack methods to investigate the size of these fields, many times relying on anecdotal knowledge on which fields are “hot topics” or oversaturated. Thus, we developed a bibliometric method analyzing authorship information from PubMed to estimate the size of fields based on unique author counts. Our major findings are that unique author counts serve as an efficient measurement of the size of a given field. Additionally, the size of a biomedical science field correlates to its public health burden when compared to case numbers. This method allows us to compare growth rates, workforce distribution, and the allocation of resources between fields to understand how scientific fields self-regulate. These insights can, in turn, help guide policymaking, for example, in funding allocation, to ensure fields are not neglected.</jats:p>

            Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by complex etiology and a disrupted colonic ecosystem. We provide a framework for the analysis of multi-omic data, which we apply to study the gut ecosystem in IBD. Specifically, we train and validate models using data on the metagenome, metatranscriptome, virome, and metabolome from the Human Microbiome Project 2 IBD multi-omic database, with 1,785 repeated samples from 130 individuals (103 cases and 27 controls). After splitting the participants into training and testing groups, we used mixed-effects least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to select features for each omic. These features, with demographic covariates, were used to generate separate single-omic prediction scores. All four single-omic scores were then combined into a final regression to assess the relative importance of the individual omics and the predictive benefits when considered together. We identified several species, pathways, and metabolites known to be associated with IBD risk, and we explored the connections between data sets. Individually, metabolomic and viromic scores were more predictive than metagenomics or metatranscriptomics, and when all four scores were combined, we predicted disease diagnosis with a Nagelkerke’s
            <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>
            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
            of 0.46 and an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.63, 0.98). Our work supports that some single-omic models for complex traits are more predictive than others, that incorporating multiple omic data sets may improve prediction, and that each omic data type provides a combination of unique and redundant information. This modeling framework can be extended to other complex traits and multi-omic data sets.

            <jats:p>Complex traits are characterized by many biological and environmental factors, such that multi-omic data sets are well-positioned to help us understand their underlying etiologies. We applied a prediction framework across multiple omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and viromics) from the gut ecosystem to predict inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosis. The predicted scores from our models highlighted key features and allowed us to compare the relative utility of each omic data set in single-omic versus multi-omic models. Our results emphasized the importance of metabolomics and viromics over metagenomics and metatranscriptomics for predicting IBD status. The greater predictive capability of metabolomics and viromics is likely because these omics serve as markers of lifestyle factors such as diet. This study provides a modeling framework for multi-omic data, and our results show the utility of combining multiple omic data types to disentangle complex disease etiologies and biological signatures.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>
            Evaluating domestication signatures beyond model organisms is essential for a thorough understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship in wild and human-related environments. Structural variations (SVs) can significantly impact phenotypes playing an important role in the physiological adaptation of species to different niches, including during domestication. A detailed characterization of the fitness consequences of these genomic rearrangements, however, is still limited in non-model systems, largely due to the paucity of direct comparisons between domesticated and wild isolates. Here, we used a combination of sequencing strategies to explore major genomic rearrangements in a
            <jats:italic>Lachancea cidri</jats:italic>
            yeast strain isolated from cider (CBS2950) and compared them to those in eight wild isolates from primary forests. Genomic analysis revealed dozens of SVs, including a large reciprocal translocation (~16 kb and 500 kb) present in the cider strain, but absent from all wild strains. Interestingly, the number of SVs was higher relative to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the cider strain, suggesting a significant role in the strain’s phenotypic variation. The set of SVs identified directly impacts dozens of genes and likely underpins the greater fermentation performance in the
            <jats:italic>L. cidri</jats:italic>
            CBS2950. In addition, the large reciprocal translocation affects a proline permease (
            <jats:italic>PUT4</jats:italic>
            ) regulatory region, resulting in higher
            <jats:italic>PUT4</jats:italic>
            transcript levels, which agrees with higher ethanol tolerance, improved cell growth when using proline, and higher amino acid consumption during fermentation. These results suggest that SVs are responsible for the rapid physiological adaptation of yeast to a human-related environment and demonstrate the key contribution of SVs in adaptive fermentative traits in non-model species.

              , a non-model species recently isolated from fermentative environments in cider in France. The significance of our study lies in the identification of large array of major genomic rearrangements in a cider strain compared to wild isolates, which underly several fermentative traits. These domestication signatures result from structural variants, which are likely responsible for the phenotypic differences between strains, providing a rapid path of adaptation to human-related environments.

            <jats:p>Individuals with autism often exhibit symptoms of social invariance, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and repetitive behaviors. However, early intervention and treatment can be effective in improving social skills and mitigating autism symptoms, including behaviors related to irritability. Although taking medication for autism may lead to side effects such as weight gain, probiotics can be an ideal intervention for alleviating these symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effects of Probio-M8 intervention on the behavior of autistic mice using an open-field test, a three-chamber sociability test, and a novel object recognition test. Metagenomic analysis revealed differences in gut microbiota diversity among groups, predicted changes in metabolite levels, and functionally annotated CAZy. Additionally, we analyzed serum neurotransmitter levels and found that probiotics were beneficial in mitigating neurotransmitter imbalances in mice with autism.</jats:p>

In this study, we aimed to better understand the relationships between the microorganisms and the short-chain fatty acid composition of the rectal content, including the possible linkage with the fatty acid composition in backfat and muscle of the pig. We studied a Duroc × Iberian crossbred population, and we found significant correlations between different bacterial and archaeal genera and the fatty acid profile.

            ) and host proteases. However, the impact of host proteases on DENV proliferation is not well understood. In this study, we utilized fluorophosphonate-based probes (FPs) to investigate the up-regulation of host serine proteases during DENV infection in detail. Among the identified proteases, acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (ACOT2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes acyl-CoA molecules to generate fatty acids and free CoA, exhibited cleavage activity against DENV polypeptide substrates. Enzymatic assays and virological experiments confirmed that ACOT2 contributes to DENV propagation during the replication stage by cleaving the viral polyprotein. Docking models provided insights into the binding pocket of viral polypeptides and the catalytic mechanism of ACOT2. Notably, this study is the first to demonstrate that ACOT2 functions as a serine protease to hydrolyze protein substrates. These findings offer novel insights into DENV infection, host response, as well as the potential development of innovative antiviral strategies.

            Microbial communities have evolved to colonize all ecosystems of the planet, from the deep sea to the human gut. Microbes survive by sensing, responding, and adapting to immediate environmental cues. This process is driven by signal transduction proteins such as histidine kinases, which use their sensing domains to bind or otherwise detect environmental cues and “transduce” signals to adjust internal processes. We hypothesized that an ecosystem’s unique stimuli leave a sensor “fingerprint,” able to identify and shed insight on ecosystem conditions.

            ecosystems across the globe. We extracted and clustered the collection’s nearly 18M unique sensory domains into 113,712 similar groupings with MMseqs2. We built gradient-boosted decision tree machine learning models and found we could classify the ecosystem type (accuracy: 87%) and predict the levels of different physical parameters (R2 score: 83%) using the sensor cluster abundance as features. Feature importance enables identification of the most predictive sensors to differentiate between ecosystems which can lead to mechanistic interpretations if the sensor domains are well annotated. To demonstrate this, a machine learning model was trained to predict patient’s disease state and used to identify domains related to oxygen sensing present in a healthy gut but missing in patients with abnormal conditions. Moreover, since 98.7% of identified sensor domains are uncharacterized, importance ranking can be used to prioritize sensors to determine what ecosystem function they may be sensing. Furthermore, these new predictive sensors can function as targets for novel sensor engineering with applications in biotechnology, ecosystem maintenance, and medicine.

            <jats:p>Microbes infect, colonize, and proliferate due to their ability to sense and respond quickly to their surroundings. In this research, we extract the sensory proteins from a diverse range of environmental, engineered, and host-associated metagenomes. We trained machine learning classifiers using sensors as features such that it is possible to predict the ecosystem for a metagenome from its sensor profile. We use the optimized model’s feature importance to identify the most impactful and predictive sensors in different environments. We next use the sensor profile from human gut metagenomes to classify their disease states and explore which sensors can explain differences between diseases. The sensors most predictive of environmental labels here, most of which correspond to uncharacterized proteins, are a useful starting point for the discovery of important environment signals and the development of possible diagnostic interventions.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>
            The microbiota plays an important role in both hypertension (HTN) and periodontitis (PD), and PD exacerbates the development of HTN by oral and gut microbiota. Previous studies have focused on exploring the importance of the bacteriome in HTN and PD but overlooked the impact of the virome, which is also a member of the microbiota. We collected 180 samples of subgingival plaques, saliva, and feces from a cohort of healthy subjects (nHTNnPD), subjects with HTN (HTNnPD) or PD (PDnHTN), and subjects with both HTN and PD (HTNPD). We performed metagenomic sequencing to assess the roles of the oral and gut viromes in HTN and PD. The HTNnPD, PDnHTN, and HTNPD groups all showed significantly distinct beta diversity from the nHTNnPD group in saliva. We analyzed alterations in oral and gut viral composition in HTN and/or PD and identified significantly changed viruses in each group. Many viruses across three sites were significantly associated with blood pressure and other clinical parameters. Combined with these clinical associations, we found that
            <jats:italic>Gillianvirus</jats:italic>
            in subgingival plaques was negatively associated with HTN and that
            <jats:italic>Torbevirus</jats:italic>
            in saliva was positively associated with HTN. We found that
            <jats:italic>Pepyhexavirus</jats:italic>
            from subgingival plaques was indicated to be transferred to the gut. We finally evaluated viral-bacterial transkingdom interactions and found that viruses and bacteria may cooperate to affect HTN and PD. Correspondingly, HTN and PD may synergize to improve communications between viruses and bacteria.

            <jats:p>Periodontitis (PD) and hypertension (HTN) are both highly prevalent worldwide and cause serious adverse outcomes. Increasing studies have shown that PD exacerbates HTN by oral and gut microbiota. Previous studies have focused on exploring the importance of the bacteriome in HTN and PD but overlooked the impact of the virome, even though viruses are common inhabitants in humans. Alterations in oral and gut viral diversity and composition contribute to diseases. The present study, for the first time, profiled the oral and gut viromes in HTN and/or PD. We identified key indicator viruses and their clinical implications in HTN and/or PD. We also investigated interactions between viruses and bacteria. This work improved the overall understanding of the viromes in HTN and PD, providing vital insights into the role of the virome in the development of HTN and PD.</jats:p>

            ), a database that comprehensively includes 3,943 reported AMR gene information for 1,997 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and 1,946 other genes as well as a total of 27,395 predicted protein structures. These structures, which include both wild-type AMR genes and their mutants, were derived from 80,094 publicly available whole-genome sequences. In addition, we developed the rapid analysis and detection tool of antimicrobial-resistance (RADAR), a one-stop analysis pipeline to detect AMR genes across whole-genome sequencing (WGSs). By integrating BOARDS and RADAR, the AMR prevalence landscape for eight multi-drug resistant pathogens was reconstructed, leading to unexpected findings such as the pre-existence of the MCR genes before their official reports. Enzymatic structure prediction-based analysis revealed that the occurrence of mutations found in some ESBL genes was found to be closely related to the binding affinities with their antibiotic substrates. Overall, BOARDS can play a significant role in performing in-depth analysis on AMR.

            Jellyfish blooms are increasingly becoming a recurring seasonal event in marine ecosystems, characterized by a rapid build-up of gelatinous biomass that collapses rapidly.

            The queen caste plays a central role in colony success in eusocial insects, as queens lay eggs and regulate colony behavior and development. Queen failure can cause colonies to collapse, which is one of the major concerns of beekeepers. Thus, understanding the biology behind the queen’s health is a pressing issue. Previous studies have shown that the bee microbiome plays an important role in worker bee health, but little is known about the queen microbiome and its function

            Systems biology research on host-associated microbiota focuses on two fundamental questions: which microbes are present and how do they interact with each other, their host, and the broader host environment? Metagenomics provides us with a direct answer to the first part of the question: it unveils the microbial inhabitants, e.g., on our skin, and can provide insight into their functional potential. Yet, it falls short in revealing their active role. Metabolomics shows us the chemical composition of the environment in which microbes thrive and the transformation products they produce. In particular, untargeted metabolomics has the potential to observe a diverse set of metabolites and is thus an ideal complement to metagenomics. However, this potential often remains underexplored due to the low annotation rates in MS-based metabolomics and the necessity for multiple experimental chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions. Beyond detection, prospecting metabolites’ functional role in the host/microbiome metabolome requires identifying the biological processes and entities involved in their production and biotransformations. In the present study of the human scalp, we developed a strategy to achieve comprehensive structural and functional annotation of the metabolites in the human scalp environment, thus diving one step deeper into the interpretation of “omics” data. Leveraging a collection of openly accessible software tools and integrating microbiome data as a source of functional metabolite annotations, we finally identified the specific metabolic niche of

              The ecological impacts of long-term (press) disturbance on mechanisms regulating the relative abundance (i.e., commonness or rarity) and temporal dynamics of species within a community remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for the functionally important arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi; obligate plant-root endosymbionts that colonize more than two-thirds of terrestrial plant species. Here, we use high-resolution amplicon sequencing to examine how AM fungal communities in a specific extreme ecosystem—mofettes or natural CO

              exhalations—are affected by long-term stress. We found that in mofettes, specific and temporally stable communities form as a subset of the local metacommunity. These communities are less diverse and dominated by adapted, “stress tolerant” taxa. Those taxa are rare in control locations and more benign environments worldwide, but show a stable temporal pattern in the extreme sites, consistently dominating the communities in grassland mofettes. This pattern of lower diversity and high dominance of specific taxa has been confirmed as relatively stable over several sampling years and is independently observed across multiple geographic locations (mofettes in different countries). This study implies that the response of soil microbial community composition to long-term stress is relatively predictable, which can also reflect the community response to other anthropogenic stressors (e.g., heavy metal pollution or land use change). Moreover, as AM fungi are functionally differentiated, with different taxa providing different benefits to host plants, changes in community structure in response to long-term environmental change have the potential to impact terrestrial plant communities and their productivity.

              <jats:p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic relationships with more than two-thirds of plant species. In return for using plant carbon as their sole energy source, AM fungi improve plant mineral supply, water balance, and protection against pathogens. This work demonstrates the importance of long-term experiments to understand the effects of long-term environmental change and long-term disturbance on terrestrial ecosystems. We demonstrated a consistent response of the AM fungal community to a long-term stress, with lower diversity and a less variable AM fungal community over time under stress conditions compared to the surrounding controls. We have also identified, for the first time, a suite of AM fungal taxa that are consistently observed across broad geographic scales in stressed and anthropogenically heavily influenced ecosystems. This is critical because global environmental change in terrestrial ecosystems requires an integrative approach that considers both above- and below-ground changes and examines patterns over a longer geographic and temporal scale, rather than just single sampling events.</jats:p>

              Understanding the ecological impacts of viruses on natural and engineered ecosystems relies on the accurate identification of viral sequences from community sequencing data. To maximize viral recovery from metagenomes, researchers frequently combine viral identification tools. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is unknown. Here, we benchmarked combinations of six widely used informatics tools for viral identification and analysis (VirSorter, VirSorter2, VIBRANT, DeepVirFinder, CheckV, and Kaiju), called “rulesets.” Rulesets were tested against mock metagenomes composed of taxonomically diverse sequence types and diverse aquatic metagenomes to assess the effects of the degree of viral enrichment and habitat on tool performance. We found that six rulesets achieved equivalent accuracy [Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) = 0.77,
              <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
              <jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>
              ≥ 0.05]. Each contained VirSorter2, and five used our “tuning removal” rule designed to remove non-viral contamination. While DeepVirFinder, VIBRANT, and VirSorter were each found once in these high-accuracy rulesets, they were not found in combination with each other: combining tools does not lead to optimal performance. Our validation suggests that the MCC plateau at 0.77 is partly caused by inaccurate labeling within reference sequence databases. In aquatic metagenomes, our highest MCC ruleset identified more viral sequences in virus-enriched (44%–46%) than in cellular metagenomes (7%–19%). While improved algorithms may lead to more accurate viral identification tools, this should be done in tandem with careful curation of sequence databases. We recommend using the VirSorter2 ruleset and our empirically derived tuning removal rule. Our analysis provides insight into methods for

              The identification of viruses from environmental metagenomes using informatics tools has offered critical insights in microbial ecology. However, it remains difficult for researchers to know which tools optimize viral recovery for their specific study. In an attempt to recover more viruses, studies are increasingly combining the outputs from multiple tools without validating this approach. After benchmarking combinations of six viral identification tools against mock metagenomes and environmental samples, we found that these tools should only be combined cautiously. Two to four tool combinations maximized viral recovery and minimized non-viral contamination compared with either the single-tool or the five- to six-tool ones. By providing a rigorous overview of the behavior of

              During their long evolution, anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria have inhabited a wide variety of natural habitats and developed specific strategies to cope with the challenges of any particular environment. Expression, assembly, and safe operation of the photosynthetic apparatus must be regulated to prevent reactive oxygen species generation under illumination in the presence of oxygen. Here, we report on the photoheterotrophic
              <jats:italic>Sediminicoccus</jats:italic>
              sp. strain KRV36, which was isolated from a cold stream in north-western Iceland, 30 km south of the Arctic Circle. In contrast to most aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, which stop pigment synthesis when illuminated, strain KRV36 maintained its bacteriochlorophyll synthesis even under continuous light. Its cells also contained between 100 and 180 chromatophores, each accommodating photosynthetic complexes that exhibit an unusually large carotenoid absorption spectrum. The expression of photosynthesis genes in dark-adapted cells was transiently downregulated in the first 2 hours exposed to light but recovered to the initial level within 24 hours. An excess of membrane-bound carotenoids as well as high, constitutive expression of oxidative stress response genes provided the required potential for scavenging reactive oxygen species, safeguarding bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and photosystem assembly. The unique cellular architecture and an unusual gene expression pattern represent a specific adaptation that allows the maintenance of anoxygenic phototrophy under arctic conditions characterized by long summer days with relatively low irradiance.

                sp. KRV36 was isolated from a cold stream in Iceland. It expresses its photosynthesis genes, synthesizes bacteriochlorophyll, and assembles functional photosynthetic complexes under continuous light in the presence of oxygen. Unraveling the molecular basis of this ability, which is exceptional among aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic species, will help to understand the evolution of bacterial photosynthesis in response to changing environmental conditions. It might also open new possibilities for genetic engineering of biotechnologically relevant phototrophs, with the aim of increasing photosynthetic activity and their tolerance to reactive oxygen species.

              Temporal variation in community composition is central to our understanding of the assembly and functioning of microbial communities, yet the controls over temporal dynamics for microbiomes of long-lived plants, such as trees, remain unclear. Temporal variation in tree microbiomes could arise primarily from seasonal (i.e., intra-annual) fluctuations in community composition or from longer-term changes across years as host plants age. To test these alternatives, we experimentally isolated temporal variation in plant microbiome composition using a common garden and clonally propagated plants, and we used amplicon sequencing to characterize bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities in the leaf endosphere, root endosphere, and rhizosphere of two
              <jats:italic>Populus</jats:italic>
              spp. over four seasons across two consecutive years. Microbial community composition differed among seasons and years (which accounted for up to 21% of the variation in microbial community composition) and was correlated with seasonal dissimilarity in climatic conditions. However, microbial community dissimilarity was also positively correlated with time, reflecting longer-term compositional shifts as host trees aged. Together, our findings demonstrate that temporal patterns in tree microbiomes arise from both seasonal fluctuations and longer-term changes, which interact to generate unique seasonal patterns each year. In addition to shedding light on two important controls over the assembly of plant microbiomes, our results also suggest future studies of tree microbiomes should account for background temporal dynamics when testing the drivers of spatial patterns in microbial community composition and temporal responses of plant microbiomes to environmental change.

                Microbiomes are integral to the health of host plants, but we have a limited understanding of the factors that control how the composition of plant microbiomes changes over time. Especially little is known about the microbiome of long-lived trees, relative to annual and non-woody plants. We tested how tree microbiomes changed between seasons and years in poplar (genus
                <jats:italic>Populus</jats:italic>
                ), which are widespread and ecologically important tree species that also serve as important biofuel feedstocks. We found the composition of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities differed among seasons, but these seasonal differences depended on year. This dependence was driven by longer-term changes in microbial composition as host trees developed across consecutive years. Our findings suggest that temporal variation in tree microbiomes is driven by both seasonal fluctuations and longer-term (i.e., multiyear) development.

Phenotypical measurements were conducted using the broth microdilution technique to determine the drug sensitivity of bacterial strains. Additionally, a genotypical approach was employed, involving traditional RNA sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and the computational ANNOgesic tool to detect noncoding RNAs. This study revealed the existence of various pathways and regulatory RNA elements that form a functional network. These pathways, characterized by the expression of specific genes, contribute to the combined treatment effect and bacterial survival strategies. The connections between pathways are facilitated by regulatory RNA elements that respond to environmental changes. These findings suggest an adaptive response of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions.

              High-fat diet (HFD) is well known to impact various aspects of gut health and has been associated with many diseases and inflammation. However, the impact of HFD feeding on HIV-1 rectal transmission has not yet been well addressed. With an increasing threat of HIV-1 infection in men who have sex with men (MSM), where the rectal route is the primary mode of infection, it is imperative to understand the impact of HFD on gut microbiota and inflammation and consequently, its effect on HIV-1 rectal transmission. Here, we utilized our double humanized bone marrow, liver, thymus (dHu-BLT) mouse model to assess the impact of HFD feeding on the host’s susceptibility to HIV-1 rectal transmission. We found that feeding an HFD successfully altered the gut microbial composition within 3 weeks in the dHu-BLT mouse model. In addition, levels of inflammatory mediators, specifically IL-12p70, IP-10, ICAM-1, and fecal calprotectin, were significantly higher in HFD-fed mice compared to control mice on a regular chow diet. We also observed that significantly different inflammatory markers (IL-12p70 and ICAM-1) were negatively correlated with the number of observed ASVs, Shannon diversity, and Faith’s diversity in the HFD-fed group. Notably, when repeatedly challenged with a low dose of HIV-1

Together, these results underscore the impact of HFD feeding on the gut microbiota and inflammation and suggest the significance of diet-induced gut microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in promoting viral infection.

              <jats:p>HFD induces gut microbial dysbiosis and inflammation and has been associated with many infections and disease progression; however, its impact on HIV-1 rectal transmission is largely unknown. Given the increasing threat of HIV-1 incidence in men who have sex with men (MSM), it has become crucial to comprehend the impact of factors associated with gut health, like HFD consumption, on host susceptibility to HIV-1 rectal transmission. This is particularly important since anal intercourse remains the primary mode of HIV transmission within the MSM group. In this study, utilizing our unique mouse model, featuring both the human immune system and gut microbiota, we showed that HFD feeding led to gut microbial dysbiosis, induced inflammation, and increased HIV-1 rectal transmission. Collectively, our study highlights the significant impact of HFD on gut microbiota and inflammation and suggests an HFD consumption as a potential risk factor for promoting HIV-1 rectal susceptibility.</jats:p>

              The intestine plays a pivotal role in nutrient absorption and host defense against pathogens, orchestrated in part by antimicrobial peptides secreted by Paneth cells. Among these peptides, lysozyme has multifaceted functions beyond its bactericidal activity. Here, we uncover the intricate relationship between intestinal lysozyme, the gut microbiota, and host metabolism. Lysozyme deficiency in mice led to altered body weight, energy expenditure, and substrate utilization, particularly on a high-fat diet. Interestingly, these metabolic benefits were linked to changes in the gut microbiota composition. Cohousing experiments revealed that the metabolic effects of lysozyme deficiency were microbiota-dependent. 16S rDNA sequencing highlighted differences in microbial communities, with

            <jats:p>Climate change is causing unpredictable seasonal variations globally. Due to the continuously increasing earth’s surface temperature, the rate of water evaporation is enhanced, conceiving a problem of soil salinization, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The accumulation of salt degrades soil quality, impairs plant growth, and reduces agricultural yields. Salt-tolerant, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms may offer a solution, enhancing crop productivity and soil fertility in salinized areas. In the current study, genome-resolved metagenomic analysis has been performed to investigate the salt-tolerating and plant growth-promoting potential of two hypersaline ecosystems, Sambhar Lake and Drang Mine. The samples were co-assembled independently by Megahit, MetaSpades, and IDBA-UD tools. A total of 67 metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed following the binning process, including 15 from Megahit, 26 from MetaSpades, and 26 from IDBA_UD assembly tools. As compared to other assemblers, the MAGs obtained by MetaSpades were of superior quality, with a completeness range of 12.95%–96.56% and a contamination range of 0%–8.65%. The medium and high-quality MAGs from MetaSpades, upon functional annotation, revealed properties such as salt tolerance (91.3%), heavy metal tolerance (95.6%), exopolysaccharide (95.6%), and antioxidant (60.86%) biosynthesis. Several plant growth-promoting attributes, including phosphate solubilization and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, were consistently identified across all obtained MAGs. Conversely, characteristics such as iron acquisition and potassium solubilization were observed in a substantial majority, specifically 91.3%, of the MAGs. The present study indicates that hypersaline microflora can be used as bio-fertilizing agents for agricultural practices in salinized areas by alleviating prevalent stresses.</jats:p>

Accumulation in the nature of synthetic chemicals supports the “environmental obesogen” hypothesis, such as BPA. This estrogen-mimicking xenobiotic has shown endocrine disruptive and obesogenic effects accompanied by gut microbiota misbalance that is not yet well elucidated. This study aimed to investigate specific microbiota taxa isolated and selected by direct BPA exposure and reveal its role on the overall children microbiota community and dynamics, driving toward specific obesity dysbiosis. A total of 333 BPA-resistant isolated species obtained through culturing after several exposure conditions were evaluated for their role and interplay with the global microbial community. The selected BPA-cultured taxa biomarkers showed a significant impact on alpha diversity. Specifically,

              were negatively associated. Microbial community dynamics and networks analyses showed differences according to the study groups. The normal-weight children group exhibited a more enriched, structured, and connected taxa network compared to overweight and obese groups, which could represent a more resilient community to xenobiotic substances. In this sense, subnetwork analysis generated with the BPA-cultured genera showed a correlation between taxa connectivity and more diverse potential enzymatic BPA degradation capacities.

              Bacterial plasmids play a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. However, their characterization via DNA sequencing suffers from the low abundance of plasmid DNA in those samples. Although sample preparation methods can enrich the proportion of plasmid DNA before sequencing, these methods are expensive and laborious, and they might introduce a bias by enriching only for specific plasmid DNA sequences. Nanopore adaptive sampling could overcome these issues by rejecting uninteresting DNA molecules during the sequencing process. In this study, we assess the application of adaptive sampling for the enrichment of low-abundant plasmids in known bacterial isolates using two different adaptive sampling tools. We show that a significant enrichment can be achieved even on expired flow cells. By applying adaptive sampling, we also improve the quality of
              <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
              plasmid assemblies and reduce the sequencing time. However, our experiments also highlight issues with adaptive sampling if target and non-target sequences span similar regions.

              Antimicrobial resistance causes millions of deaths every year. Mobile genetic elements like bacterial plasmids are key drivers for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. This makes the characterization of plasmids via DNA sequencing an important tool for clinical microbiologists. Since plasmids are often underrepresented in bacterial samples, plasmid sequencing can be challenging and laborious. To accelerate the sequencing process, we evaluate nanopore adaptive sampling as an

              Chronic alcohol consumption, an important risk factor for diseases and deaths, can cause intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and increase the infection of some opportunistic pathogens. However, the current studies on the effects of alcohol-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis on gut colonization of
              <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              are still scarce. In the present study, we established a binge-on-chronic alcohol model in mice to identify the characteristics of alcohol-induced intestinal microbiome and metabolite dysbiosis using multi-omics and explored the effects and potential mechanisms of these dysbioses on the intestinal colonization of
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              . The results show that chronic alcohol consumption alters the diversity and composition of gut microbiota (including bacteria and fungi), decreases the complexity of the interaction between intestinal bacteria and fungi, disturbs the gut metabolites, and promotes the colonization of
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              on the gut of mice. The relevance analyses find that alcohol-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis has a strong correlation with the alteration of secondary bile acids.
              <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>
              results suggest that the high concentration of lithocholic acid, a secondary bile acid, could significantly inhibit the proliferation of
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              , and the adhesion of
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              to Caco-2 cells. Our results indicate that alcohol-induced microbiome dysbiosis contributes to decreased levels of secondary bile acids, which was one of the main reasons affecting the colonization of

              in mice’s intestines. Some secondary bile acids (e.g., lithocholic acid) might be a potential drug to prevent the colonization and spread of

                Alcohol is one of the most commonly misused substances in our lives. However, long-term heavy drinking will increase the colonization of some opportunistic pathogens (e.g.,
                <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic>
                ) in the body. Here, we revealed that binge-on-chronic alcohol consumption disrupted the balance between gut bacteria and fungi, induced the gut microbiome and metabolites dysbiosis, and promoted the colonization of
                <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
                in the intestine of mice. In particular, alcohol-taking disrupted intestinal bile acid metabolism and reduced the lithocholic acid concentration. However, a high concentration of lithocholic acid can protect against intestinal colonization of

              Skin microbiome can be altered in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). An understanding of the changes from healthy to atopic skin can help develop new targets for treatment by identifying microbial and molecular biomarkers. This study investigates the skin microbiome and metabolome of healthy adult subjects and lesion (ADL) and non-lesion (ADNL) of AD patients by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry, respectively. Samples from AD patients showed alterations in the diversity and composition of the skin microbiome, with ADL skin having the greatest divergence.

Dipeptide derivatives are more abundant in ADL, which may be related to skin inflammation.

These foundational studies—and advances in high-throughput sequencing of transposon mutants—support unbiased screens of bacterial mutants in the fly.

              <jats:italic>Bartonella</jats:italic>
              clade together with an ant symbiont. BLS was present in mite bodies (103 16S DNA copies/mite) and feces but was absent in eggs. This indicated the presence of the BLS in mite guts. The BLS showed a reduction in genome size (1.6 Mb) and indicates gene loss compared to
              <jats:italic>Bartonella apis</jats:italic>
              . The BLS can be interacted with its host by using host metabolic pathways (e.g., the histidine and arginine metabolic pathways) as well as by providing its own metabolic pathways (pantothenate and lipoic acid) to the host, suggesting the existence of a mutualistic association. Our experimental data further confirmed these potential mutualistic nutritional associations, as cultures of
              <jats:italic>T. putrescentiae</jats:italic>
              with low BLS abundance showed the strongest response after the addition of vitamins. Despite developing an arguably tight dependency on its host, the BLS has probably retained flagellar mobility, as evidenced by the 32 proteins enriched in KEGG pathways associated with flagellar assembly or chemotaxis (e.g., fliC, flgE, and flgK, as highly expressed genes). Some of these proteins probably also facilitate adhesion to host gut cells. The microcin C transporter was identified in the BLS, suggesting that microcin C may be used in competition with other gut bacteria. The 16S DNA sequence comparison indicated a mite clade of BLSs with a broad host range, including house dust and stored-product mites. Our phylogenomic analyses identified a unique lineage of arachnid specific BLSs in mites and scorpions.

The degree to which bacteriophage predators (viruses that infect bacteria) evolve to be specialists with a single bacterial prey species versus generalists able to consume multiple types of prey has implications for their effect on microbial communities. The presence and abundance of multiple bacterial prey types can alter selection for phage generalists, but less is known about how interactions between prey shape predator specificity in microbial systems. Using a phenomenological mathematical model of phage and bacterial populations, we find that the dominant phage strategy depends on prey ecology. Given a fitness cost for generalism, generalist predators maintain an advantage when prey species compete, while specialists dominate when prey are obligately engaged in cross-feeding interactions. We test these predictions in a synthetic microbial community with interacting strains of
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
              cost of generalism is caused by a combination of biological mechanisms not anticipated in our model. Our work demonstrates that interactions between bacteria play a role in shaping ecological selection on predator specificity in obligately lytic bacteriophages and emphasizes the diversity of ways in which fitness trade-offs can manifest.

              There is significant natural diversity in how many different types of bacteria a bacteriophage can infect, but the mechanisms driving this diversity are unclear. This study uses a combination of mathematical modeling and an

              system consisting of
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>vir</jats:italic>
              to highlight the connection between bacteriophage specificity and interactions between their potential microbial prey. Mathematical modeling suggests that competing bacteria tend to favor generalist bacteriophage, while bacteria that benefit each other tend to favor specialist bacteriophage. Experimental results support this general finding. The experiments also show that the optimal phage strategy is impacted by phage degradation and bacterial physiology. These findings enhance our understanding of how complex microbial communities shape selection on bacteriophage specificity, which may improve our ability to use phage to manage antibiotic-resistant microbial infections.

              is a representative and dominant species in the infant gut and is considered a beneficial microbe. This organism displays multiple adaptations to thrive in the infant gut, regarded as a model for human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) utilization. These carbohydrates are abundant in breast milk and include different molecules based on lactose. They contain fucose, sialic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine.
              <jats:italic>Bifidobacterium</jats:italic>
              metabolism is complex, and a systems view of relevant metabolic pathways and exchange metabolites during HMO consumption is missing. To address this limitation, a refined genome-scale network reconstruction of this bacterium is presented using a previous reconstruction of
              <jats:italic>B. infantis</jats:italic>
              ATCC 15967 as a template. The latter was expanded based on an extensive revision of genome annotations, current literature, and transcriptomic data integration. The metabolic reconstruction (
              <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>
              LR578) accounted for 578 genes, 1,047 reactions, and 924 metabolites. Starting from this reconstruction, we built context-specific genome-scale metabolic models using RNA-seq data from cultures growing in lactose and three HMOs. The models revealed notable differences in HMO metabolism depending on the functional characteristics of the substrates. Particularly, fucosyl-lactose showed a divergent metabolism due to a fucose moiety. High yields of lactate and acetate were predicted under growth rate maximization in all conditions, whereas formate, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol were substantially lower. Similar results were also obtained under near-optimal growth on each substrate when varying the empirically observed acetate-to-lactate production ratio. Model predictions displayed reasonable agreement between central carbon metabolism fluxes and expression data across all conditions. Flux coupling analysis revealed additional connections between succinate exchange and arginine and sulfate metabolism and a strong coupling between central carbon reactions and adenine metabolism. More importantly, specific networks of coupled reactions under each carbon source were derived and analyzed. Overall, the presented network reconstruction constitutes a valuable platform for probing the metabolism of this prominent infant gut bifidobacteria.

              Although vaginitis is closely related to vaginal microecology in females, the precise composition and functional potential of different types of vaginitis remain unclear. Here, metagenomic sequencing was applied to analyze the vaginal flora in patients with various forms of vaginitis, including cases with a clue cell proportion ranging from 1% to 20% (Clue1_20), bacterial vaginitis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and BV combined with VVC (VVC_BV). Our results identified
              <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</jats:italic>
              in patients with BV, Clue1_20, and healthy women. Interestingly, the vaginal flora of patients in the VVC_BV group exhibited structural similarities to that of the VVC group, and its potentially functional characteristics resembled those of the BV and VVC groups. Finally,

              Transposases are mobile genetic elements that move within and between genomes, promoting genomic plasticity in microorganisms. In marine microbial communities, the abundance of transposases increases with depth, but the reasons behind this trend remain unclear. Our analysis of metagenomes from the
              <jats:italic>Tara</jats:italic>
              Oceans and Malaspina Expeditions suggests that a particle-associated lifestyle is the main covariate for the high occurrence of transposases in the deep ocean, and this trend holds true for individual genomes as well as in a community-wide sense. We observed a strong and depth-independent correlation between transposase abundance and the presence of biofilm-associated genes, as well as the prevalence of secretory enzymes. This suggests that mobile genetic elements readily propagate among microbial communities within crowded biofilms. Furthermore, we show that particle association positively correlates with larger genome size, which is in turn associated with higher transposase abundance. Cassette sequences associated with transposons are enriched with genes related to defense mechanisms, which are more highly expressed in the deep sea. Thus, while transposons spread at the expense of their microbial hosts, they also introduce novel genes and potentially benefit the hosts in helping to compete for limited resources. Overall, our results suggest a new understanding of deep ocean particles as highways for gene sharing among defensively oriented microbial genomes.

              <jats:p>Genes can move within and between microbial genomes via mobile genetic elements, which include transposases and transposons. In the oceans, there is a puzzling increase in transposase abundance in microbial genomes as depth increases. To gain insight into this trend, we conducted an extensive analysis of marine microbial metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. We found a significant correlation between transposase abundance and a particle-associated lifestyle among marine microbes at both the metagenome and genome-resolved levels. We also observed a link between transposase abundance and genes related to defense mechanisms. These results suggest that as microbes become densely packed into crowded particles, mobile genes are more likely to spread and carry genetic material that provides a competitive advantage in crowded habitats. This may enable deep sea microbes to effectively compete in such environments.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Increasing levels of industrialization have been associated with changes in gut microbiome structure and loss of features thought to be crucial for maintaining gut ecological balance. The stability of gut microbial communities over time within individuals seems to be largely affected by these changes but has been overlooked among transitioning populations from low- to middle-income countries. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to characterize the temporal dynamics in gut microbiomes of 24 individuals living an urban non-industrialized lifestyle in the Brazilian Amazon. We further contextualized our data with 165 matching longitudinal samples from an urban industrialized and a rural non-industrialized population. We show that gut microbiome composition and diversity have greater variability over time among non-industrialized individuals when compared to industrialized counterparts and that taxa may present diverse temporal dynamics across human populations. Enterotype classifications show that community types are generally stable over time despite shifts in microbiome structure. Furthermore, by tracking genomes over time, we show that levels of bacterial population replacements are more frequent among Amazonian individuals and that non-synonymous variants accumulate in genes associated with degradation of host dietary polysaccharides. Taken together, our results suggest that the stability of gut microbiomes is influenced by levels of industrialization and that tracking microbial population dynamics is important to understand how the microbiome will adapt to these transitions.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>The transition from a rural or non-industrialized lifestyle to urbanization and industrialization has been linked to changes in the structure and function of the human gut microbiome. Understanding how the gut microbiomes changes over time is crucial to define healthy states and to grasp how the gut microbiome interacts with the host environment. Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of gut microbiomes from an urban and non-industrialized population in the Amazon, as well as metagenomic data sets from urban United States and rural Tanzania. We showed that healthy non-industrialized microbiomes experience greater compositional shifts over time compared to industrialized individuals. Furthermore, bacterial strain populations are more frequently replaced in non-industrialized microbiomes, and most non-synonymous mutations accumulate in genes associated with the degradation of host dietary components. This indicates that microbiome stability is affected by transitions to industrialization, and that strain tracking can elucidate the ecological dynamics behind such transitions.</jats:p>

              Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are indispensable biotechnology facilities for modern cities and play an essential role in modern urban infrastructure by employing microorganisms to remove pollutants in wastewater, thus protecting public health and the environment. This study conducted a 13-month bacterial community survey of six full-scale WWTPs in Hong Kong with samples of influent, activated sludge (AS), and effluent to explore their synchronism and asynchronism of bacterial community. Besides, we compared AS results of six Hong Kong WWTPs with data from 1,186 AS amplicon data in 269 global WWTPs and a 9-year metagenomic sequencing survey of a Hong Kong WWTP. Our results showed the compositions of bacterial communities varied and the bacterial community structure of AS had obvious differences across Hong Kong WWTPs. The co-occurrence analysis identified 40 pairs of relationships that existed among Hong Kong WWTPs to show solid associations between two species and stochastic processes took large proportions for the bacterial community assembly of six WWTPs. The abundance and distribution of the functional bacteria in worldwide and Hong Kong WWTPs were examined and compared, and we found that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria had more diversity than nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Besides, Hong Kong WWTPs could make great contributions to the genome mining of microbial dark matter in the global “wanted list.” Operational parameters had important effects on OTUs’ abundance, such as the temperature to the genera of

            <jats:p>Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an indispensable component of modern cities, as they can remove pollutants in wastewater to prevent anthropogenic activities. Activated sludge (AS) is a fundamental wastewater treatment process and it harbors a highly complex microbial community that forms the main components and contains functional groups. Unveiling “who is there” is a long-term goal of the research on AS microbiology. High-throughput sequencing provides insights into the inventory diversity of microbial communities to an unprecedented level of detail. At present, the analysis of communities in WWTPs usually comes from a specific WWTP and lacks comparisons and verification among different WWTPs. The wide-scale and long-term sampling project and research in this study could help us evaluate the AS community more accurately to find the similarities and different results for different WWTPs in Hong Kong and other regions of the world.</jats:p>

              The continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a highly variable system characterized by strong cross-shelf gradients, rapid regional change, and large blooms of phytoplankton, notably diatoms. Rapid environmental changes coincide with shifts in plankton community composition and productivity, food web dynamics, and biogeochemistry. Despite the progress in identifying important environmental factors influencing plankton community composition in the WAP, the molecular basis for their survival in this oceanic region, as well as variations in species abundance, metabolism, and distribution, remains largely unresolved. Across a gradient of physicochemical parameters, we analyzed the metabolic profiles of phytoplankton as assessed through metatranscriptomic sequencing. Distinct phytoplankton communities and metabolisms closely mirrored the strong gradients in oceanographic parameters that existed from coastal to offshore regions. Diatoms were abundant in coastal, southern regions, where colder and fresher waters were conducive to a bloom of the centric diatom,
              <jats:italic>Actinocyclus</jats:italic>
              . Members of this genus invested heavily in growth and energy production; carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways; and coping with oxidative stress, resulting in uniquely expressed metabolic profiles compared to other diatoms. We observed strong molecular evidence for iron limitation in shelf and slope regions of the WAP, where diatoms in these regions employed iron-starvation induced proteins, a geranylgeranyl reductase, aquaporins, and urease, among other strategies, while limiting the use of iron-containing proteins. The metatranscriptomic survey performed here reveals functional differences in diatom communities and provides further insight into the environmental factors influencing the growth of diatoms and their predicted response to changes in ocean conditions.

              In the Southern Ocean, phytoplankton must cope with harsh environmental conditions such as low light and growth-limiting concentrations of the micronutrient iron. Using metratranscriptomics, we assessed the influence of oceanographic variables on the diversity of the phytoplankton community composition and on the metabolic strategies of diatoms along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, a region undergoing rapid climate change. We found that cross-shelf differences in oceanographic parameters such as temperature and variable nutrient concentrations account for most of the differences in phytoplankton community composition and metabolism. We opportunistically characterized the metabolic underpinnings of a large bloom of the centric diatom
              <jats:italic>Actinocyclus</jats:italic>
              in coastal waters of the WAP. Our results indicate that physicochemical differences from onshore to offshore are stronger than between southern and northern regions of the WAP; however, these trends could change in the future, resulting in poleward shifts in functional differences in diatom communities and phytoplankton blooms.

              Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that mainly causes diarrhea in suckling piglets, and also has the potential for cross-species transmission. However, there are still no commercial vaccines available to prevent and control PDCoV infection. In this study, PDCoV strain HNZK-02 was serially propagated
              <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
              for up to 150 passages and the amino acid changes have mainly occurred in the S protein during serial passage which caused structure change. PDCoV HNZK-02-passage 5 (P5)-infected piglets exhibited acute and severe watery diarrhea, an obvious intestinal damage, while the piglets infected with PDCoV HNZK-02-P150 showed no obvious clinical signs, weak intestinal lesions, and lower viral loads in rectal swabs and various tissues. Compared with the PDCoV HNZK-02-P5 infection, HNZK-02-P150 infection resulted in a decrease in intestinal mucosal permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, PDCoV HNZK-02-P5 infection had significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, while PDCoV HNZK-02-P150 infection did not significantly affect the bacterial diversity, and the relative abundance of probiotics increased. Furthermore, the alterations of gut microbiota were closely related to the change of pro-inflammatory factor. Metagenomics prediction analysis demonstrated that HNZK-02-P150 modulated the tyrosine metabolism, Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, which coincided with lower inflammatory response and intestinal permeability in the piglets infected with HNZK-02-P150. In conclusion, the PDCoV HNZK-02 was successfully attenuated by serial passage

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines available for PDCoV. In addition, gut microbiota has an important relationship with the development of many diseases. Here, the PDCoV virulent HNZK-02 strain was successfully attenuated by serial passage on cell cultures, and the pathogenesis and effects on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic function of the PDCoV HNZK-02-P5 and P150 strains were investigated in piglets. We also found the genetic changes in the S protein during passage

            <jats:p>The crucial function of circulating microbial DNA (cmDNA) in peripheral blood is gaining recognition because of its importance in normal physiology and immunity in healthy individuals. Evidence suggests that cmDNA in peripheral blood is derived from highly abundant, translocating gut microbes. However, the associations with and differences between cmDNA in peripheral blood and the gut microbiome remain unclear. We collected blood, urine, and fecal samples from volunteers to compare their microbial information via 16S rDNA sequencing. The results revealed that, compared with gut microbial DNA, cmDNA in peripheral blood was associated with reduced diversity and a distinct microbiota composition. The cmDNA in the blood reflects the biochemical processes of microorganisms, including synthesis, energy conversion, degradation, and adaptability, surpassing that of fecal samples. Interestingly, cmDNA in blood showed a limited presence of DNA from anaerobes and gram-positive bacteria, which contrast with the trend observed in fecal samples. Furthermore, analysis of cmDNA revealed traits associated with mobile elements and potential pathologies, among others, which were minimal in stool samples. Notably, cmDNA analysis indicated similarities between the microbial functions and phenotypes in blood and urine samples, although greater diversity was observed in urine samples. Source Tracker analysis suggests that gut microbes might not be the main source of blood cmDNA, or a selective mechanism allows only certain microbial DNA into the bloodstream. In conclusion, our study highlights the composition and potential functions associated with cmDNA in peripheral blood, emphasizing its selective presence; however, further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>Our research provides novel insights into the unique characteristics and potential functional implications of circulating microbial DNA (cmDNA) in peripheral blood. Unlike other studies that analyzed sequencing data from fecal or blood microbiota in different study cohorts, our comparative analysis of cmDNA from blood, urine, and fecal samples from the same group of volunteers revealed a distinct blood-specific cmDNA composition. We discovered a decreased diversity of microbial DNA in blood samples compared to fecal samples as well as an increased presence of biochemical processes microbial DNA in blood. Notably, we add to the existing knowledge by documenting a reduced abundance of anaerobes and gram-positive bacteria in blood compared to fecal samples according to the analysis of cmDNA and gut microbial DNA, respectively. This observation suggested that a potential selective barrier or screening mechanism might filter microbial DNA molecules, indicating potential selectivity in the translocation process which contrasts with the traditional view that cmDNA primarily originates from random translocation from the gut and other regions. By highlighting these differences, our findings prompt a reconsideration of the origin and role of cmDNA in blood circulation and suggest that selective processes involving more complex biological mechanisms may be involved.</jats:p>

              The biological route of nitrate reduction has important implications for the bioavailability of nitrogen within ecosystems. Nitrate reduction via nitrite, either to ammonium (ammonification) or to nitrous oxide or dinitrogen (denitrification), determines whether nitrogen is retained within the system or lost as a gas. The acidophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium (aSRB)
              <jats:italic>Acididesulfobacillus acetoxydans</jats:italic>
              can perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). While encoding a Nar-type nitrate reductase,
              <jats:italic>A. acetoxydans</jats:italic>
              lacks recognized nitrite reductase genes. In this study,
              <jats:italic>A. acetoxydans</jats:italic>
              was cultivated under conditions conducive to DNRA. During cultivations, we monitored the production of potential nitrogen intermediates (nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide, hydroxylamine, and ammonium). Resting cell experiments were performed with nitrate, nitrite, and hydroxylamine to confirm their reduction to ammonium, and formed intermediates were tracked. To identify the enzymes involved in DNRA, comparative transcriptomics and proteomics were performed with
              <jats:italic>A. acetoxydans</jats:italic>
              growing under nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions. Nitrite is likely reduced to ammonia by the previously undescribed nitrite reductase activity of the NADH-linked sulfite reductase AsrABC, or by a putatively ferredoxin-dependent homolog of the nitrite reductase NirA (DEACI_1836), or both. We identified enzymes and intermediates not previously associated with DNRA and nitrosative stress in aSRB. This increases our knowledge about the metabolism of this type of bacteria and helps the interpretation of (meta)genome data from various ecosystems on their DNRA potential and the nitrogen cycle.

Among those, PGN_1547 was highly upregulated in the CRISPR-Cas 3 mutant. PGN_1547 is annotated as a hypothetical protein.

We performed genome sequencing based on 20 worker bee samples of each species. Applying evolutionary population genetics and metagenomic approaches, we detected genes under selection and analyzed functional pathways between bumblebees and their gut microbes. We found clear genetic differentiation between the two host species and significant differences in their microbiota. Species replacement occurred in both hosts and their bacteria (
              <jats:italic>Snodgrassella</jats:italic>
              ) with an increase in elevation. These extremely high-elevation bumblebees show evidence of positive selection related to diverse biological processes. Positively selected genes involved in host immune systems probably contributed to gut microbiota changes, while the butyrate generated by gut microbiota may influence both host energy metabolism and immune systems. This suggests a close association between the genomes of the host species and their microbiomes based on some degree of natural selection.

                Two closely related and dominant bumblebee species, distributed at different elevations through the Hengduan Mountains of southwestern China, showed a clear genomic signature of adaptation to elevation at the molecular level and significant differences in their respective microbiota. Species replacement occurred in both hosts and their bacteria (
                <jats:italic>Snodgrassella</jats:italic>
                ) with an increase in elevation. Bumblebees’ adaptations to higher elevations are closely associated with their gut microbiota through two biological processes: energy metabolism and immune response. Information allowing us to understand the adaptive mechanisms of species to extreme conditions is implicit if we are to conserve them as their environments change.

              is a leading cause of global mortality. Transfer of plasmids carrying genes encoding beta-lactamases, carbapenamases, and colistin resistance between lineages is driving the rising rates of hard-to-treat nosocomial and community infections. Multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmid acquisition commonly causes transcriptional disruption, and while a number of studies have shown strain-specific fitness and transcriptional effects of an MDR plasmid across diverse bacterial lineages, fewer studies have compared the impacts of different MDR plasmids in a common bacterial host. As such, our ability to predict which MDR plasmids are the most likely to be maintained and spread in bacterial populations is limited. Here, we introduced eight diverse MDR plasmids encoding resistances against a range of clinically important antibiotics into
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              K-12 MG1655 and measured their fitness costs and transcriptional impacts. The scale of the transcriptional responses varied substantially between plasmids, ranging from &gt;650 to &lt;20 chromosomal genes being differentially expressed. However, the scale of regulatory disruption did not correlate significantly with the magnitude of the plasmid fitness cost, which also varied between plasmids. The identities of differentially expressed genes differed between transconjugants, although the expression of certain metabolic genes and functions were convergently affected by multiple plasmids, including the downregulation of genes involved in L-methionine transport and metabolism. Our data show the complexity of the interaction between host genetic background and plasmid genetic background in determining the impact of MDR plasmid acquisition on

              , the primary subspecies classification scheme used is serotyping: differentiating variants within these species by surface antigen profiles. Serotype prediction from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates is now seen as comparable or preferable to traditional laboratory methods where WGS is available. However, laboratory and WGS methods depend on an isolation step that is time-consuming and incompletely represents the sample when multiple strains are present. Community sequencing approaches that skip the isolation step are, therefore, of interest for pathogen surveillance. Here, we evaluated the viability of amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene for serotyping
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>
              and

We developed a novel algorithm for serotype prediction, implemented as an R package (Seroplacer), which takes as input full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and outputs serovar predictions after phylogenetic placement into a reference phylogeny. We achieved over 89% accuracy in predicting

Although serotype prediction from 16S rRNA gene sequences is not as accurate as serotype prediction from WGS of isolates, the potential to identify dangerous serovars directly from amplicon sequencing of environmental samples is intriguing for pathogen surveillance. The capabilities developed here are also broadly relevant to other applications where intraspecies variation and direct sequencing from environmental samples could be valuable.

                In order to prevent and stop outbreaks of foodborne pathogens, it is important that we can detect when pathogenic bacteria are present in a food or food-associated site and identify connections between specific pathogenic bacteria present in different samples.

Our results suggest current limitations to serotyping from 16S rRNA gene sequencing alone but set the stage for further progress that we consider likely given the rapid advance in the long-read sequencing technologies and genomic databases our work leverages. If this research direction succeeds, it could enable better detection of foodborne pathogens before they reach the public and speed the resolution of foodborne pathogen outbreaks.

              Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem due to the high incidence affecting approximately one-third of the world’s population. NAFLD is usually linked to obesity and excessive weight. A subset of patients with NAFLD expresses normal or low body mass index; thus, the condition is called non-obese NAFLD or lean NAFLD. However, patients and healthcare professionals have little awareness and understanding of NAFLD in non-obese individuals. Furthermore, preclinical results from non-obese animal models with NAFLD are unclear. Gut microbiota and their metabolites in non-obese/lean-NAFLD patients differ from those in obese NAFLD patients. Therefore, we analyzed the biochemical indices, intestinal flora, and intestinal metabolites in a non-obese NAFLD mouse model established using a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. The significantly lean MCD mice had a remarkable fatty liver with lower serum triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as higher alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels than normal mice. 16S RNA sequencing of fecal DNA showed that the overall richness and diversity of the intestinal flora decreased in MCD mice, whereas the Firmicutes:Bacteroidota ratio was increased. g_

Fecal metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed the potential biomarkers for the prognosis and diagnosis of non-obese NAFLD, including high levels of tyramine glucuronide, 9,12,13-TriHOME, and pantetheine 4′-phosphate, and low levels of 3-carbamoyl-2-phenylpropionaldehyde, N-succinyl-L,L-2,6-diaminopimelate, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, homogentisic acid, and estriol. Our findings could be useful to identify and develop drugs to treat non-obese NAFLD and lean NAFLD.

              Patients and healthcare professionals have little awareness and understanding of NAFLD in non-obese individuals. In fact, about 40% of people with NAFLD worldwide are non-obese, and nearly one-fifth are lean. Lean NAFLD unfortunately may be unnoticed for years and remains undetected until hepatic damage is advanced and the prognosis is compromised. This study focused on the lean NAFLD, screened therapeutic agents, and biomarkers for the prognosis and diagnosis using MCD-induced male C57BL/6J mice. The metabolites tyramine glucuronide, 9,12,13-TriHOME, and pantetheine 4′-phosphate, together with the predominant flora including g_

              For embryo implantation and fetal development, the maternal immune system undergoes dramatic changes. The mechanisms involved in inducing alterations of maternal immunity have not been fully clarified. Gut microbiome and metabolites were thought to influence the host immune response. During normal pregnancy, notable changes occur in the gut microbiota and metabolites. However, the relationship of these alterations to immune function during pregnancy remains unclear. In this study, we examined gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, plasma metabolites, and cytokines in pregnant women and non-pregnant women. Our findings revealed that, in comparison to non-pregnant women, pregnant women exhibit a significant increase in the relative abundance of
              <jats:italic>Actinobacteriota</jats:italic>
              and notable differences in metabolic pathways related to bile acid secretion. Furthermore, there was a marked reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in pregnant women. Correlation analyses indicated that these alterations in cytokines may be linked to specific gut bacteria and metabolites. Bacteria within the same microbial modules exhibited consistent effects on cytokines, suggesting that gut bacteria may function as functional groups. Mediation analysis further identified that certain bacteria might influence cytokines through metabolites, such as bile acids and arachidonic acid. Our findings propose potential biological connections between bacteria, metabolites, and immunity, which require further validation in future studies.

The ProkFunFind tool was developed to bridge the gap between these various annotation approaches, providing a flexible and customizable search approach to annotate microbial functions. ProkFunFind is designed around hierarchical definitions of biological functions, where individual genes can be identified using heterogeneous search terms consisting of sequences, profile hidden Markov models, protein domains, and orthology groups. This flexible and customizable search approach allows for searches to be tailored to specific biological functions, and the search results are output in multiple formats to facilitate downstream analyses. The utility of the ProkFunFind search tool was demonstrated through its application in searching for bacterial flagella, which are complex organelles composed of multiple genes.

Here we present the first reference genome for this important plant pathogenic fungi and use it to study the population genomics of 70 isolates from an affected forest in the north of Spain. We find signs of introgression between the two main lineages, indicating that active mating is occurring in this region which could propitiate the appearance of novel traits in this species.

              Imbalanced gut microbiota (GM) and abnormal fecal bile acid (BA) are thought to be the key factors for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we explore the influence of the GM–BA–Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) axis on IBS-D. Twenty-five IBS-D patients and fifteen healthy controls were recruited to perform BA-related metabolic and metagenomic analyses. Further, the microbiota-humanized IBS-D rat model was established by fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) to investigate the GM–BA–TGR5 axis effects on the colonic barrier and visceral hypersensitivity (VH) in IBS-D. Finally, we used chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an important BA screened out by metabolome, to evaluate whether it affected diarrhea and VH via the TGR5 pathway. Clinical research showed that GM associated with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity such as
              <jats:italic>Bacteroides ovatus</jats:italic>
              was markedly reduced in the GM of IBS-D, accompanied by elevated total and primary BA levels. Moreover, we found that CDCA not only was increased as the most important primary BA in IBS-D patients but also could induce VH through upregulating TGR5 in the colon and ileum of normal rats. TGR5 inhibitor could reverse the phenotype, depression-like behaviors, pathological change, and level of fecal BSH in a microbiota-humanized IBS-D rat model. Our findings proved that human-associated FMT could successfully induce the IBS-D rat model, and the imbalanced GM–BA–TGR5 axis may promote colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction and enhance VH in IBS-D.

              Visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal mucosal barrier damage are important factors that cause abnormal brain–gut interaction in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Recently, it was found that the imbalance of the gut microbiota–bile acid axis is closely related to them. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the gut microbiota and bile acids and the underlying mechanisms by which they shape visceral hypersensitivity and mucosal barrier damage in IBS-D is critical. An examination of intestinal feces from IBS-D patients revealed that alterations in gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism underlie IBS-D and symptom onset. We also expanded beyond existing knowledge of well-studied gut microbiota and bile acid and found that
              <jats:italic>Bacteroides ovatus</jats:italic>
              and chenodeoxycholic acid may be potential bacteria and bile acid involved in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. Moreover, our data integration reveals the influence of the microbiota–bile acid–TGR5 axis on barrier function and visceral hypersensitivity.

              Engineering microbial hosts to synthesize pyruvate derivatives depends on blocking pyruvate oxidation, thereby causing severe growth defects in aerobic glucose-based bioprocesses. To decouple pyruvate metabolism from cell growth to improve pyruvate availability, a genome-scale metabolic model combined with constraint-based flux balance analysis, geometric flux balance analysis, and flux variable analysis was used to identify genetic targets for strain design. Using translation elements from a ~3,000 cistronic library to modulate
              <jats:italic>fxpK</jats:italic>
              expression in a bicistronic cassette, a bifido shunt pathway was introduced to generate three molecules of non-pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA from one molecule of glucose, bypassing pyruvate oxidation and carbon dioxide generation. The dynamic control of flux distribution by T7 RNAP-mediated synthetic small RNA decoupled pyruvate catabolism from cell growth. Adaptive laboratory evolution and multi-omics analysis revealed that a mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase functioned as a metabolic switch to activate the glyoxylate shunt as the only C4 anaplerotic pathway to generate malate from two molecules of acetyl-CoA input and bypass two decarboxylation reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A chassis strain for pyruvate derivative synthesis was constructed to reduce carbon loss by using the glyoxylate shunt as the only C4 anaplerotic pathway and the bifido shunt as a non-pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA synthetic pathway and produced 22.46, 27.62, and 6.28 g/L of

                Bio-manufacturing from biomass-derived carbon sources using microbes as a cell factory provides an eco-friendly alternative to petrochemical-based processes. Pyruvate serves as a crucial building block for the biosynthesis of industrial chemicals; however, it is different to improve pyruvate availability

                due to the coupling of pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA with microbial growth and energy metabolism via the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle. A genome-scale metabolic model combined with three algorithm analyses was used for strain design. Carbon metabolism was reprogrammed using two genetic control tools to fine-tune gene expression. Adaptive laboratory evolution and multi-omics analysis screened the growth-related regulatory targets beyond rational design. A novel metabolic pattern of glucose-grown bacteria is established to maintain growth fitness and minimize carbon loss under aerobic conditions for the synthesis of pyruvate-derived products. This study provides valuable insights into the design of a microbial cell factory for synthetic biology to produce industrial bio-products of interest.

              A grand challenge for the next century is in facing a changing climate through bioengineering solutions. Biological nitrogen fixation, the globally consequential, nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to bioavailable ammonia, is a vital area of focus. Nitrogen fixation engineering relies upon extensive understanding of underlying genetics in microbial models, including the broadly utilized gammaproteobacterium,

              (

              that integrates genomically via site-specific transposon insertion. We demonstrate that CRISPRi can repress transcription of an essential nitrogen fixation gene by ~60%. Further, we show that nitrogenase genes are suitably expressed from the transposon insertion site, indicating that CRISPRi and engineered nitrogen fixation genes can be co-integrated for combinatorial studies of gene expression and engineering. Our established CRISPRi system fills an important gap for engineering microbial nitrogen fixation for desired purposes.

                All life on Earth requires nitrogen to survive. About 78% of the atmosphere alone is nitrogen, yet humans cannot use it directly. Instead, we obtain the nitrogen we need for our survival through the food we eat. For more than 100 years, a substantial portion of agricultural productivity has relied on industrial methods for nitrogen fertilizer synthesis, which consumes significant amounts of nonrenewable energy resources and exacerbates environmental degradation and human-induced climate change. Promising alternatives to these industrial methods rely on engineering the only biological pathway for generating bioaccessible nitrogen: microbial nitrogen fixation. Bioengineering strategies require an extensive understanding of underlying genetics in nitrogen-fixing microbes, but genetic tools for this critical goal remain lacking. The CRISPRi gene silencing system that we report, developed in the broadly utilized nitrogen-fixing bacterial model,
                <jats:italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</jats:italic>

              The morphogenesis of sexual fruiting bodies of fungi is a complex process determined by a genetically encoded program.

In this work, we functionally characterized a highly conserved gene termed

We took advantage of this phenotype to study fruiting body differentiation using RNA-Seq analyses. This revealed differentially regulated genes and gene families that, based on wild-type RNA-Seq data, were upregulated early during development and showed tissue-specific expression, suggesting a potential role in differentiation.

              bacteria are renowned both for their antibiotic production capabilities and for their cryptic metabolic potential. Their metabolic repertoire is subject to stringent genetic control, with many of the associated biosynthetic gene clusters being repressed by the conserved nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2. In an effort to stimulate new antibiotic production in wild
              <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>
              isolates, we leveraged the activity of an Lsr2 knockdown construct and successfully enhanced antibiotic production in the wild
              <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>
              isolate WAC07094. We determined that this new activity stemmed from increased levels of the angucycline-like family member saquayamycin. Saquayamycin has both antibiotic and anti-cancer activities, and intriguingly, beyond Lsr2-mediated repression, we found saquayamycin production was also suppressed at high density on solid or in liquid growth media; its levels were greatest in low-density cultures. This density-dependent control was exerted at the level of the cluster-situated regulatory gene
              <jats:italic>sqnR</jats:italic>
              and was mediated in part through the activity of the PhoRP two-component regulatory system, where deleting
              <jats:italic>phoRP</jats:italic>
              led to both constitutive antibiotic production and
              <jats:italic>sqnR</jats:italic>
              expression. This suggests that PhoP functions to repress the expression of
              <jats:italic>sqnR</jats:italic>
              at high cell density. We further discovered that magnesium supplementation could alleviate this density dependence, although its action was independent of PhoP. Finally, we revealed that the nitrogen-responsive regulators GlnR and AfsQ1 could relieve the repression exerted by Lsr2 and PhoP. Intriguingly, we found that this low density-dependent production of saquayamycin was not unique to WAC07094; saquayamycin production by another wild isolate also exhibited low-density activation, suggesting that this spatial control may serve an important ecological function in their native environments.

                <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>
                isolate WAC07094, production of the angucycline-family compound saquayamycin is subject to a unique constellation of control factors. Notably, it is produced primarily at low cell density, in contrast to the high cell density production typical of most antibiotics. This unusual density dependence is conserved in other saquayamycin producers and is driven by the pathway-specific regulator SqnR, whose expression is influenced by both nutritional and genetic elements. Collectively, this work provides new insights into an intricate regulatory system governing antibiotic production and indicates there may be benefits to including low-density cultures in antibiotic screening platforms.

              Small RNAs have been found to control a broad range of bacterial phenotypes including tolerance to antibiotics. Vancomycin tolerance in multidrug resistance
              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
              is correlated with dysregulation of small RNAs although their contribution to antibiotic tolerance is poorly understood. RNA-RNA interactome profiling techniques are expanding our understanding of sRNA-mRNA interactions in bacteria; however, determining the function of these interactions for hundreds of sRNA-mRNA pairs is a major challenge. At steady-state, protein and mRNA abundances are often highly correlated and lower than expected protein abundance may indicate translational repression of an mRNA. To identify sRNA-mRNA interactions that regulate mRNA translation, we examined the correlation between gene transcript abundance, ribosome occupancy, and protein levels. We used the machine learning technique self-organizing maps (SOMs) to cluster genes with similar transcription and translation patterns and identified a cluster of mRNAs that appeared to be post-transcriptionally repressed. By integrating our clustering with sRNA-mRNA interactome data generated in vancomycin-tolerant
              <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>
              by RNase III-CLASH, we identified sRNAs that may be mediating translational repression. We have confirmed sRNA-dependant post-transcriptional repression of several mRNAs in this cluster. Two of these interactions are mediated by RsaOI, a sRNA that is highly upregulated by vancomycin. We demonstrate the regulation of HPr and the cell-wall autolysin Atl. These findings suggest that RsaOI coordinates carbon metabolism and cell wall turnover during vancomycin treatment.

              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
              (MRSA) is a major public health concern. Current treatment is dependent on the efficacy of last-line antibiotics like vancomycin. The most common cause of vancomycin treatment failure is strains with intermediate resistance or tolerance that arise through the acqusition of a diverse repertoire of point mutations. These strains have been shown to altered small RNA (sRNA) expression in response to antibiotic treatment. Here, we have used a technique termed RNase III-CLASH to capture sRNA interactions with their target mRNAs. To understand the function of these interactions, we have looked at RNA and protein abundance for mRNAs targeted by sRNAs. Messenger RNA and protein levels are generally well correlated and we use deviations from this correlation to infer post-transcriptional regulation and the function of individual sRNA-mRNA interactions. Using this approach we identify mRNA targets of the vancomycin-induced sRNA, RsaOI, that are repressed at the translational level. We find that RsaOI represses the cell wall autolysis Atl and carbon transporter HPr suggestion a link between vancomycin treatment and suppression of cell wall turnover and carbon metabolism.

              Iron is a transition metal used as a cofactor in many biochemical reactions. In bacteria, iron homeostasis involves Fur-mediated de-repression of iron uptake systems, such as the iron-chelating compounds siderophores. In this work, we identified and characterized novel regulatory systems that control siderophores in the environmental opportunistic pathogen
              <jats:italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</jats:italic>
              . Screening of a 10,000-transposon mutant library for siderophore halos identified seven possible regulatory systems involved in siderophore-mediated iron homeostasis in
              <jats:italic>C. violaceum</jats:italic>
              . Further characterization revealed a regulatory cascade that controls siderophores involving the transcription factor VitR acting upstream of the quorum-sensing (QS) system CviIR. Mutation of the regulator VitR led to an increase in siderophore halos, and a decrease in biofilm, violacein, and protease production. We determined that these effects occurred due to VitR-dependent de-repression of
              <jats:italic>vioS</jats:italic>
              . Increased VioS leads to direct inhibition of the CviR regulator by protein-protein interaction. Indeed, insertion mutations in

Classical QS-dependent processes (violacein, proteases, and antibiotics) were activated at high cell density by both CviI and CviR. However, genes related to iron homeostasis and many other processes were regulated by CviR but not CviI, suggesting that CviR acts without its canonical CviI autoinducer.

Many mutants with increased siderophore halos had transposon insertions in genes encoding transcription factors, including a novel regulator called VitR, and CviR, the regulator of the quorum-sensing (QS) system CviIR.

              Functional genomics techniques, such as transposon insertion sequencing and RNA-sequencing, are key to studying relative differences in bacterial mutant fitness or gene expression under selective conditions. However, certain stress conditions, mutations, or antibiotics can directly interfere with DNA synthesis, resulting in systematic changes in local DNA copy numbers along the chromosome. This can lead to artifacts in sequencing-based functional genomics data when comparing antibiotic treatment to an unstressed control. Further, relative differences in gene-wise read counts may result from alterations in chromosomal replication dynamics, rather than selection or direct gene regulation. We term this artifact “chromosomal location bias” and implement a principled statistical approach to correct it by calculating local normalization factors along the chromosome. These normalization factors are then directly incorporated into statistical analyses using standard RNA-sequencing analysis methods without modifying the read counts themselves, preserving important information about the mean-variance relationship in the data. We illustrate the utility of this approach by generating and analyzing a ciprofloxacin-treated transposon insertion sequencing data set in
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              as a case study. We show that ciprofloxacin treatment generates chromosomal location bias in the resulting data, and we further demonstrate that failing to correct for this bias leads to false predictions of mutant drug sensitivity as measured by minimum inhibitory concentrations. We have developed an R package and user-friendly graphical Shiny application, ChromoCorrect, that detects and corrects for chromosomal bias in read count data, enabling the application of functional genomics technologies to the study of antibiotic stress.

              Understanding the organizational principles of microbial communities is essential for interpreting ecosystem stability. Previous studies have investigated the formation of bacterial communities under nutrient-poor conditions or obligate relationships to observe cooperative interactions among different species. How microorganisms form stabilized communities in nutrient-rich environments, without obligate metabolic interdependency for growth, is still not fully disclosed. In this study, three bacterial strains isolated from the
              <jats:italic>Populus deltoides</jats:italic>
              rhizosphere were co-cultured in complex medium, and their growth behavior was tracked. These strains co-exist in mixed culture over serial transfer for multiple growth-dilution cycles. Competition is proposed as an emergent interaction relationship among the three bacteria based on their significantly decreased growth levels. The effects of different initial inoculum ratios, up to three orders of magnitude, on community structure were investigated, and the final compositions of the mixed communities with various starting composition indicate that community structure is not dependent on the initial inoculum ratio. Furthermore, the competitive relationships within the community were not altered by different initial inoculum ratios. The community structure was simulated by generalized Lotka-Volterra and dynamic flux balance analysis to provide mechanistic predictions into emergence of community structure under a nutrient-rich environment. Metaproteomic analyses provide support for the metabolite exchanges predicted by computational modeling and for highly altered physiologies when microbes are grown in co-culture. These findings broaden our understanding of bacterial community dynamics and metabolic diversity in higher-order interactions and could be significant in the management of rhizospheric bacterial communities.

Here, we provide a comparative analysis of the resistome from pigs, poultry, veal calves, turkey, and rainbow trout, for a total of 538 herds across nine European countries. We calculated the effects of per-farm management practices and antimicrobial usage (AMU) on the resistome in pigs, broilers, and veal calves. We also provide an in-depth study of the associations between bacterial diversity, resistome diversity, and AMR abundances as well as co-occurrence analysis of bacterial taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the universality of the latter. The resistomes of veal calves and pigs clustered together, as did those of avian origin, while the rainbow trout resistome was different. Moreover, we identified clear core resistomes for each specific food-producing animal species. We identified positive associations between bacterial alpha diversity and both resistome alpha diversity and abundance. Network analyses revealed very few taxa–ARG associations in pigs but a large number for the avian species. Using updated reference databases and optimized bioinformatics, previously reported significant associations between AMU, biosecurity, and AMR in pig and poultry farms were validated. AMU is an important driver for AMR; however, our integrated analyses suggest that factors contributing to increased bacterial diversity might also be associated with higher AMR load. We also found that dispersal limitations of ARGs are shaping livestock resistomes, and future efforts to fight AMR should continue to emphasize biosecurity measures.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>The human gut microbiota is a dynamic community of microorganisms that undergo variable changes over the entire life span. To thoroughly investigate the possible fluctuations of the microbiota throughout human life, we performed a pooled analysis of healthy fecal samples across different age groups covering the entire human life span. Our study integrated data from 79 publicly available studies and new stool samples from an Italian cohort, i.e., the Parma Microbiota project, resulting in 6,653 samples processed through the shotgun metagenomic approach. This approach has allowed species-level taxonomic reconstruction of the gut microbiota and investigation of its metabolic potential across the human life span. From a taxonomic point of view, our findings confirmed and detailed at species-level accuracy that the microbial richness of the gut microbiota gradually increases in the first stage of life, becoming relatively stable during adolescence. Moreover, the analysis identified the potential core microbiota representative of distinct age groups, revealing age-related bacterial patterns and the continuous rearrangement of the microbiota in terms of relative abundances across the life span rather than the acquisition and loss of taxa. Furthermore, the shotgun approach provided insights into the functional contribution of the human gut microbiome. The metagenomic analysis revealed functional age-related differences, particularly in carbohydrate and fiber metabolism, suggesting a co-evolution of the microbiome assembly with diet. Additionally, we identified correlations between vitamin synthesis, such as thiamine and niacin, and early life, suggesting a potential role of the microbiome in human physiology, in particular in the functions of the host’s nervous and immune systems.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>In this study, we provided comprehensive insights into the dynamic nature of the human gut microbiota across the human life span. In detail, we analyzed a large data set based on a shotgun metagenomic approach, combining public data sets and new samples from the Parma Microbiota project and obtaining a detailed overview of the possible relationship between gut microbiota development and aging. Our findings confirmed the main stages in microbial richness development and revealed specific core microbiota associated with different age stages. Moreover, the shotgun metagenomic approach allowed the disentangling of the functional changes in the microbiome across the human life span, particularly in diet-related metabolism, which is probably correlated to bacterial co-evolution with dietary habits. Notably, our study also uncovered positive correlations with vitamin synthesis in early life, suggesting a possible impact of the microbiota on human physiology.</jats:p>

              Secondary bacterial challenges during influenza virus infection “superinfection”) cause excessive mortality and hospitalization. Here, we present a longitudinal study of bulk gene expression changes in murine lungs during superinfection, with an initial influenza A virus infection and a subsequent
              <jats:italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              infection. In addition to the well-characterized impairment of the host response, we identified superinfection-specific alterations in the global transcriptional program that are linked to the host’s ability to resist the pathogens. Particularly, whereas superinfected mice manifested an excessive rapid induction of the resistance-to-infection program, there was a substantial tissue-level rewiring of this program: upon superinfection, interferon-regulated genes were switched from positive to negative correlations with the host’s resistance state, whereas genes of fatty acid metabolism switched from negative to positive correlations with resistance states. Thus, the transcriptional resistance state in superinfection is reprogrammed toward repressed interferon signaling and induced fatty acid metabolism. Our findings suggest new insights into a tissue-level remodeling of the host defense upon superinfection, providing promising targets for future therapeutic interventions.

              Secondary bacterial infections are the most frequent complications during influenza A virus (IAV) pandemic outbreaks, contributing to excessive morbidity and mortality in the human population. Most IAV-related deaths are attributed to
              <jats:italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              (SP) infections, which usually begin within the first week of IAV infection in the respiratory tracts. Here, we focused on longitudinal transcriptional responses during a superinfection model consisting of an SP infection that follows an initial IAV infection, comparing superinfection to an IAV-only infection, an SP-only infection, and control treatments. Our longitudinal data allowed a fine analysis of gene expression changes during superinfection. For instance, we found that superinfected mice exhibited rapid gene expression induction or reduction within the first 12 h after encountering the second pathogen. Cell proliferation and immune response activation processes were upregulated, while endothelial processes, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis were downregulated, providing promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. We further analyzed the longitudinal transcriptional responses in the context of a previously defined spectrum of the host’s resistance state, revealing superinfection-specific reprogramming of resistance states, such as reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism and interferon signaling. The reprogrammed functions are compelling new targets for switching the pathogenic superinfection state into a single-infection state.

Although studies have revealed the latitudinal patterns of microbial community structure and single ecosystem function, the latitudinal patterns of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) and how microbial communities affect EMF along a latitudinal gradient remain unclear. Here, we collected channel sediments, riparian rhizosphere soils, and riparian bulk soils from 30 rivers across China and calculated EMF using 18 variables related to nitrogen cycling, nutrient pool, plant productivity, and water quality. We also determined microbial diversity (taxonomic and functional) and microbial network complexity using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that EMF significantly decreased with increasing latitude in riparian rhizosphere and bulk soils but not in channel sediments. Microbial taxonomic and functional richness (observed species) in channel sediments were significantly higher in the low-latitude group than in the high-latitude group. However, microbial co-occurrence networks were more complex in the high-latitude group compared with the low-latitude group. Abiotic factors, primarily geographic and climatic factors, contributed more to EMF than microbial diversity and network complexity parameters in which only betweenness centralization had a significant relationship with EMF. Together, this study provides insight into the latitudinal pattern of EMF in rivers and highlights the importance of large-scale factors in explaining such latitudinal patterns.</jats:p>

              HB0801 that lacked the protein MbovP0725 induced a stronger inflammatory response but with a partial reduction of adhesion ability. Using transcriptome sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, we found that the mutant was upregulated by the mRNA expression of genes from the glycolysis pathway, while downregulated by the genes enriched in ABC transporters and acetate kinase–phosphate acetyltransferase pathway. Untargeted metabolomics showed that the disruption of the
              <jats:italic>Mbov_0725</jats:italic>
              gene caused the accumulation of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and the consumption of cytidine 5′-monophosphate, uridine monophosphate, and adenosine monophosphate. Both the exogenous and endogenous MbvoP0725 protein created by purification and transfection inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA production and could also attenuate the activation of MAPK-associated pathways after LPS treatment. A pull-down assay identified MAPK p38 and ERK as potential substrates for MbovP0725. These findings define metabolism- and virulence-related roles for a HAD family phosphatase and reveal its ability to inhibit the host pro-inflammatory response.

              Metabolic maladaptation in dairy cows after calving can lead to long-term elevation of ketones, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), representing the condition known as hyperketonemia, which greatly influences the health and production performance of cows during the lactation period. Although the gut microbiota is known to alter in dairy cows with hyperketonemia, the association of microbial metabolites with development of hyperketonemia remains unknown. In this study, we performed a multi-omics analysis to investigate the associations between fecal microbial community, fecal/plasma metabolites, and serum markers in hyperketonemic dairy cows during the transition period. Dynamic changes in the abundance of the phyla Verrucomicrobiota and Proteobacteria were detected in the gut microbiota of dairy cows, representing an adaptation to enhanced lipolysis and abnormal glucose metabolism after calving. Random forest and univariate analyses indicated that
              <jats:italic>Frisingicoccus</jats:italic>
              is a key bacterial genus in the gut of cows during the development of hyperketonemia, and its abundance was positively correlated with circulating branched-chain amino acid levels and the ketogenesis pathway. Taurodeoxycholic acid, belonging to the microbial metabolite, was strongly correlated with an increase in blood BHB level, and the levels of other secondary bile acid in the feces and plasma were altered in dairy cows prior to the diagnosis of hyperketonemia, which link the gut microbiota and hyperketonemia. Our results suggest that alterations in the gut microbiota and its metabolites contribute to excessive lipolysis and insulin insensitivity during the development of hyperketonemia, providing fundamental knowledge about manipulation of gut microbiome to improve metabolic adaptability in transition dairy cows.

              <jats:p>Accumulating evidence is pointing to an important association between gut microbiota-derived metabolites and metabolic disorders in humans and animals; however, this association in dairy cows from late gestation to early lactation is poorly understood. To address this gap, we integrated longitudinal gut microbial (feces) and metabolic (feces and plasma) profiles to characterize the phenotypic differences between healthy and hyperketonemic dairy cows from late gestation to early lactation. Our results demonstrate that cows underwent excessive lipid mobilization and insulin insensitivity before hyperketonemia was evident. The bile acids are functional readouts that link gut microbiota and host phenotypes in the development of hyperketonemia. Thus, this work provides new insight into the mechanisms involved in metabolic adaptation during the transition period to adjust to the high energy and metabolic demands after calving and during lactation, which can offer new strategies for livestock management involving intervention of the gut microbiome to facilitate metabolic adaptation.</jats:p>

              cultures grown in the presence of different oxidants using a novel ionization technique for mass spectrometry, laser desorption rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (LD-REIMS).

No pyocyanin was detectable and elastase concentrations were reduced by more than 75% in cultures grown with sub-lethal concentrations of HOCl, suggesting that this neutrophil-derived oxidant may disrupt the ability of

              This work demonstrates that a high-throughput ambient ionization mass spectrometry method can be used successfully to study a bacterial stress response. Its application to the opportunistic pathogen
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              led to the identification of specific oxidative stress biomarkers, and demonstrated that hypochlorous acid, an oxidant specifically produced by human neutrophils during infection, affects quorum sensing and reduces production of the virulence factors pyocyanin and elastase. No pyocyanin was detectable and elastase levels were reduced by more than 75% in bacteria grown in the presence of hypochlorous acid. This approach has the potential to be widely applicable to the characterization of the stress responses of bacteria.

              Cyanobacteria fix carbon dioxide and release carbon-containing compounds into the wider ecosystem, yet they are sensitive to small metabolites that may impact their growth and physiology. Several cyanobacteria can grow mixotrophically, but we currently lack a molecular understanding of how specific nutrients may alter the compounds they release, limiting our knowledge of how environmental factors might impact primary producers and the ecosystems they support. In this study, we develop a high-throughput phytoplankton culturing platform and identify how the model cyanobacterium

              sp. PCC 6803 responds to nutrient supplementation. We assess growth responses to 32 nutrients at two concentrations, identifying 15 that are utilized mixotrophically. Seven nutrient sources significantly enhance growth, while 19 elicit negative growth responses at one or both concentrations. High-throughput exometabolomics indicates that oxidative stress limits

Furthermore, glucose and valine induce strong changes in metabolite exudation in a possible effort to correct pathway imbalances or maintain intracellular elemental ratios. This study sheds light on the flexibility and limits of cyanobacterial physiology and metabolism, as well as how primary production and trophic food webs may be modulated by exogenous nutrients.

                Given the widespread conservation of two-component systems (TCSs) in bacteria and their pivotal role in regulating metabolic and virulence pathways, they present a compelling target for anti-microbial agents, especially in the face of rising multi-drug-resistant infections. Harnessing TCSs therapeutically necessitates a profound understanding of their evolutionary trajectory in signal transduction, as this underlies their unique or shared virulence regulatory pathways. Such insights are critical for effectively targeting TCS components, ensuring an optimized impact on bacterial virulence, and mitigating the risk of resistance emergence via the evolution of alternative pathways. Our research offers an in-depth exploration of virulence determinants controlled by TCSs in

              The regulation of
              <jats:italic>Bordetella pertussis</jats:italic>
              virulence is mediated by the two-component system BvgA/S, which activates the transcription of virulence-activated genes (
              <jats:italic>vag</jats:italic>
              s). In the avirulent phase, the
              <jats:italic>vag</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>B. pertussis</jats:italic>

              s is regulated by phosphorylated RisA. However, the expression of some, including those involved in flagellum biosynthesis and chemotaxis, requires RisA independently of phosphorylation. Many RisA-regulated genes encode proteins with regulatory functions, suggesting multiple RisA regulation cascades. By ChIPseq analyses, we identified 430 RisA-binding sites, 208 within promoter regions, 201 within open reading frames, and 21 in non-coding regions. RisA binding was demonstrated in the promoter regions of most

              The chaperone 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is important for cells from bacteria to humans to maintain proteostasis, and all eukaryotes and several prokaryotes encode Hsp70 paralogs. Although the mechanisms of Hsp70 function have been clearly illuminated, the function and evolution of Hsp70 paralogs is not well studied. DnaK is a highly conserved bacterial Hsp70 family. Here, we show that
              <jats:italic>dnaK</jats:italic>
              is present in 98.9% of bacterial genomes, and 6.4% of them possess two or more DnaK paralogs. We found that the duplication of
              <jats:italic>dnaK</jats:italic>
              is positively correlated with an increase in proteomic complexity (proteome size, number of domains). We identified the interactomes of the two DnaK paralogs of
              <jats:italic>Myxococcus xanthus</jats:italic>
              DK1622 (MxDnaKs), which revealed that they are mostly nonoverlapping, although both prefer α and β domain proteins. Consistent with the entire
              <jats:italic>M. xanthus</jats:italic>
              proteome, MxDnaK substrates have both significantly more multi-domain proteins and a higher isoelectric point than that of
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              , which encodes a single DnaK homolog. MxDnaK1 is transcriptionally upregulated in response to heat shock and prefers to bind cytosolic proteins, while MxDnaK2 is downregulated by heat shock and is more associated with membrane proteins. Using domain swapping, we show that the nucleotide-binding domain and the substrate-binding β domain are responsible for the significant differences in DnaK interactomes, and the nucleotide binding domain also determines the dimerization of MxDnaK2, but not MxDnaK1. Our work suggests that bacterial DnaK has been duplicated in order to deal with a more complex proteome, and that this allows evolution of distinct domains to deal with different subsets of target proteins.

                All eukaryotic and ~40% of prokaryotic species encode multiple 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) homologs with similar but diversified functions. Here, we show that duplication of canonical Hsp70 (DnaK in prokaryotes) correlates with increasing proteomic complexity and evolution of particular regions of the protein. Using the
                <jats:italic>Myxococcus xanthus</jats:italic>
                DnaK duplicates as a case, we found that their substrate spectrums are mostly nonoverlapping, and are both consistent to that of

                DnaK in structural and molecular characteristics, but show differential enrichment of membrane proteins. Domain/region swapping demonstrated that the nucleotide-binding domain and the β substrate-binding domain (SBDβ), but not the SBDα or disordered C-terminal tail region, are responsible for this functional divergence. This work provides the first direct evidence for regional evolution of DnaK paralogs.

              Bacterial secondary metabolites serve as an important source of molecules for drug discovery. They also play an important function in mediating the interactions of microbial producers with their living environment and surrounding organisms. However, little is known about the genetic novelty, distribution, and community-level impacts of soil bacterial biosynthetic potential on a large geographic scale. Here, we constructed the first catalog of 11,149 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from agricultural soils across China and unearthed hidden biosynthetic potential for new natural product discovery from the not-yet-cultivated soil bacteria. Notably, we revealed soil pH as the strongest environmental driver of BGC biogeography and predicted that soil acidification and global climate change could damage the biosynthetic potential of the soil microbiome. The co-occurrence network of bacterial genomes revealed two BGC-rich species, i.e.,
              <jats:italic>Nocardia niigatensis</jats:italic>
              from Actinobacteriota and

              from Acidobacteriota, as the module hub and connector, respectively, indicating their keystone positions in the soil microbial communities. We also uncovered a dominant role of BGC-inferred biotic interactions over environmental drivers in structuring the soil microbiome. Overall, this study achieved novel insights into the BGC landscape in agricultural soils of China, substantially expanding our understanding of the diversity and novelty of bacterial secondary metabolism and the potential role of secondary metabolites in microbiota assembly.

Here, we used culture-independent metagenomics to explore biosynthetic potentials in agricultural soils of China. Our analyses revealed a high degree of genetic diversity and novelty within biosynthetic gene clusters in agricultural soil environments, offering valuable insights for biochemists seeking to synthesize novel bioactive products.

              Maternal secretor status is one of the determinants of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) composition, which, in turn, influences the gut microbiota composition of infants. To understand if this change in gut microbiota impacts immune cell composition, intestinal morphology, and gene expression, 21-day-old germ-free C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with fecal microbiota from infants whose mothers were either secretors (SMM) or non-secretors (NSM) or from infants consuming dairy-based formula (MFM). For each group, one set of mice was supplemented with HMOs. HMO supplementation did not significantly impact the microbiota diversity; however, SMM mice had a higher abundance of genus

              <jats:italic>Klebsiella</jats:italic>
              . In MFM, gut microbiota was represented mainly by

              <jats:italic>Ruminococcaceae_unclassified</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Clostrodium_sensu_stricto</jats:italic>
              . In mesenteric lymph node, Foxp3+ T cells and innate lymphoid cells type 2 were increased in MFM mice supplemented with HMOs, while in the spleen, they were increased in SMM + HMOs mice. Similarly, serum immunoglobulin A was also elevated in MFM + HMOs group. Distinct global gene expression of the gut was observed in each microbiota group, which was enhanced with HMOs supplementation. Overall, our data show that distinct infant gut microbiota due to maternal secretor status or consumption of dairy-based formula and HMO supplementation impacts immune cell composition, antibody response, and intestinal gene expression in a mouse model.

            <jats:p>Early life factors like neonatal diet modulate gut microbiota, which is important for the optimal gut and immune function. One such factor, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), the composition of which is determined by maternal secretor status, has a profound effect on infant gut microbiota. However, how the infant gut microbiota composition determined by maternal secretor status or consumption of infant formula devoid of HMOs impacts infant intestinal ammorphology, gene expression, and immune signature is not well explored. This study provides insights into the differential establishment of infant microbiota derived from infants fed by secretor or non-secretor mothers milk or those consuming infant formula and demonstrates that the secretor status of mothers promotes Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides sps. establishment. This study also shows that supplementation of pooled HMOs in mice changed immune cell composition in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and immunoglobulins in circulation. Hence, this study highlights that maternal secretor status has a role in infant gut microbiota composition, and this, in turn, can impact host gut and immune system.</jats:p>

              The contamination of the plant phyllosphere with antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), caused by application of antibiotics, is a significant environmental issue in agricultural management. Alternatively, biocontrol agents are environmentally friendly and have attracted a lot of interest. However, the influence of biocontrol agents on the phyllosphere resistome remains unknown. In this study, we applied biocontrol agents to control the wildfire disease in the Solanaceae crops and investigated their effects on the resistome and the pathogen in the phyllosphere by using metagenomics. A total of 250 ARGs were detected from 15 samples, which showed a variation in distribution across treatments of biocontrol agents (BA), BA with Mg

              Our study applied metagenomics analysis to examine the impact of biocontrol agents (BAs) on the phyllosphere resistome and the pathogen. Irregular use of antibiotics has led to the escalating dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. The majority of BA research has focused on the effect of monospecies on the plant disease control process, the role of the compound BA with nutrition elements in the phyllosphere disease, and the resistome is still unknown. We believe BAs are eco-friendly alternatives for antibiotics to combat the transfer of ARGs. Our results revealed that BA-Mg

              During prolonged resource limitation, bacterial cells can persist in metabolically active states of non-growth. These maintenance periods, such as those experienced in stationary phase, can include upregulation of secondary metabolism and release of exometabolites into the local environment. As resource limitation is common in many environmental microbial habitats, we hypothesized that neighboring bacterial populations employ exometabolites to compete or cooperate during maintenance and that these exometabolite-facilitated interactions can drive community outcomes. Here, we evaluated the consequences of exometabolite interactions over the stationary phase among three environmental strains:

We compared the responses (transcripts) and outputs (exometabolites) of each member with and without neighbors. We found that transcriptional dynamics were changed with different neighbors and that some of these changes were coordinated between members. The dominant competitor
              <jats:italic>B. thailandensis</jats:italic>
              consistently upregulated biosynthetic gene clusters to produce bioactive exometabolites for both exploitative and interference competition. These results demonstrate that competition strategies during maintenance can contribute to community-level outcomes. It also suggests that the traditional concept of defining competitiveness by growth outcomes may be narrow and that maintenance competition could be an additional or alternative measure.

Thus, it is important to investigate microbial interactions in this common and ecologically relevant condition of non-growth. This work investigates the consequences of resource limitation for community metabolic output and for population interactions in simple synthetic bacterial communities. Despite non-growth, we observed active, exometabolite-mediated competition among the bacterial populations. Many of these interactions and produced exometabolites were dependent on the community composition but we also observed that one dominant competitor consistently produced interfering exometabolites regardless.

              Plant-associated diazotrophs strongly relate to plant nitrogen (N) supply and growth. However, our knowledge of diazotrophic community assembly and microbial N metabolism in plant microbiomes is largely limited. Here we examined the assembly and temporal dynamics of diazotrophic communities across multiple compartments (soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of root and leaf, and grain) of three cereal crops (maize, wheat, and barley) and identified the potential N-cycling pathways in phylloplane microbiomes. Our results demonstrated that the microbial species pool, influenced by site-specific environmental factors (e.g., edaphic factors), had a stronger effect than host selection (i.e., plant species and developmental stage) in shaping diazotrophic communities across the soil–plant continuum. Crop diazotrophic communities were dominated by a few taxa (~0.7% of diazotrophic phylotypes) which were mainly affiliated with

Metagenomic binning recovered 58 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the phylloplane, and the majority of them were identified as novel species (37 MAGs) and harbored genes potentially related to multiple N metabolism processes (e.g., nitrate reduction). Notably, for the first time, a high-quality MAG harboring genes involved in the complete denitrification process was recovered in the phylloplane and showed high identity to

In this study, we show that the site-specific microbial species pool largely shapes the structure of diazotrophic communities in the leaves and roots of three cereal crops. We further identify keystone diazotrophic taxa in crop microbiomes and characterize potential microbial N metabolism pathways in the phyllosphere, which provides essential information for developing microbiome-based tools in future sustainable agricultural production.</jats:p>

              Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota is involved in the regulation of the host’s sex hormone levels, such as through interfering with the sex hormone metabolism in the intestine. However, if gut microbiota or its metabolites directly influence the sex hormone biosynthesis in the gonad remains largely unknown. Our previous study showed that colistin, as a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, can significantly downregulate the serum testosterone levels and thus enhance the antitumor efficiency of anti-PD-L1 in male mice; however, the underlying mechanism for the regulation of the host’s testosterone levels remains uninvestigated. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of colistin on the immune microenvironment of the testis as well as the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota in male mice. Our results showed that colistin has an impact on the immune microenvironment of the testis and can downregulate serum testosterone levels in male mice through inhibition of
              <jats:italic>Akkermansia</jats:italic>
              , leading to destroyed inosine metabolism. Supplement with inosine can restore testosterone secretion probably by prompting the recovery of the intestinal mucus barrier and the serum lipopolysaccharides levels. All these findings reveal a new pathway for the regulation of the host’s sex hormone levels by gut microbiota.

              The production of dissolved organic matter during phytoplankton blooms and consumption by heterotrophic prokaryotes promote marine carbon biogeochemical cycling. Although prokaryotic viruses presumably affect this process, their dynamics during blooms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of taxonomic difference in bloom-forming phytoplankton on prokaryotes and their viruses. We analyzed the dynamics of coastal prokaryotic communities and viruses under the addition of dissolved intracellular fractions from taxonomically distinct phytoplankton, the diatom
              <jats:italic>Chaetoceros</jats:italic>
              sp. (CIF) and the raphidophycean alga
              <jats:italic>Heterosigma akashiwo</jats:italic>
              (HIF), using microcosm experiments. Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon and viral metagenomic analyses revealed that particular prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses specifically increased in either CIF or HIF, indicating that taxonomic difference in bloom-forming phytoplankton promotes distinct dynamics of not only the prokaryotic community but also prokaryotic viruses. Furthermore, combining our microcosm experiments with publicly available environmental data mining, we identified both known and novel possible host-virus pairs. In particular, the growth of prokaryotes associating with phytoplanktonic organic matter, such as Bacteroidetes (
              <jats:italic>Polaribacter</jats:italic>

                The primary production during marine phytoplankton bloom and the consumption of the produced organic matter by heterotrophic prokaryotes significantly contribute to coastal biogeochemical cycles. While the activities of those heterotrophic prokaryotes are presumably affected by viral infection, the dynamics of their viruses during blooms are not fully understood. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that intracellular fractions of taxonomically distinct bloom-forming phytoplankton species, the diatom

                promoted the growth of taxonomically different prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses. Based on their dynamics and predicted hosts of those viruses, we succeeded in detecting already-known and novel possible host-virus pairs associating with either phytoplankton species. Altogether, we propose that the succession of bloom-forming phytoplankton would change the composition of the abundant prokaryotes, resulting in an increase in their viruses. These changes in viral composition, depending on bloom-forming species, would alter the dynamics and metabolism of prokaryotes, affecting biogeochemical cycling in blooms.

In addition, we characterized a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous-like virus (AmFLV), which shares limited protein identities with the known Apis mellifera filamentous virus. The complete sequence of AmFLV, obtained by a combination of laboratory techniques and bioinformatics, spans 152,678 bp. Linear dsDNA genome encodes for 112 proteins, of which 49 are annotated. Another large virus we discovered is Apis mellifera nudivirus, which belongs to a group of

                Although bacteria constantly replicate under laboratory conditions, natural environments expose them to various stresses such as lack of nutrients, high salinity, and pH changes, which can trigger non-replicating states. These states can enable bacteria to (i) become tolerant to antibiotics (persisters), (ii) remain inactive in specific niches for an extended period (dormancy), and (iii) adjust to hostile environments. Non-replicating states have also been studied because of the possibility of repurposing energy for the production of additional metabolites or proteins.

              The microbial utilization of dietary carbohydrates is closely linked to the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in human health. Inherent to the modulation of complex microbial communities, a prebiotic implies the selective utilization of a specific substrate, relying on the metabolic capacities of targeted microbes. In this study, we investigated the metabolic capacities of 17 commensal bacteria of the human gut microbiome toward dietary carbohydrates with prebiotic potential. First,
              <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
              experiments allowed the classification of bacterial growth and fermentation profiles in response to various carbon sources, including agave inulin, corn fiber, polydextrose, and citrus pectin. The influence of phylogenetic affiliation appeared to statistically outweigh carbon sources in determining the degree of carbohydrate utilization. Second, we narrowed our focus on six commensal bacteria representative of the
              <jats:italic>Bacteroidetes</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic>
              phyla to perform an untargeted high-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis:
              <jats:italic>Bacteroides xylanisolvens</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Eubacterium rectale</jats:italic>
              exhibited distinct metabolomic profiles in response to different carbon sources. The relative abundance of bacterial metabolites was significantly influenced by dietary carbohydrates, with these effects being strain-specific and/or carbohydrate-specific. Particularly, the findings indicated an elevation in short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites, including succinate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and nicotinic acid. These metabolites were associated with putative health benefits. Finally, an RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach provided deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolization. Restricting our focus on four commensal bacteria, including

              <jats:italic>R. intestinalis</jats:italic>
              , carbon sources did significantly modulate the level of bacterial genes related to the enzymatic machinery involved in the metabolization of dietary carbohydrates. This study provides a holistic view of the molecular strategies induced during the dynamic interplay between dietary carbohydrates with prebiotic potential and gut commensal bacteria.

              Season and location have previously been shown to be associated with differences in the microbiota of raw milk, especially in milk from pasture-based systems. Here, we further advance research in this area by examining differences in the raw milk microbiota from several locations across Ireland over 12 months, and by investigating microbiota associations with climatic variables and chemical composition. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to investigate the microbiota of raw milk collected from nine locations (

Microbiota diversity significantly differed by season and location, with differences in seasonality and geography corresponding to 11.8% and 10.5% of the variation in the microbiota. Functional and antibiotic resistance profiles also varied across season and location. The analysis of other metadata revealed additional interactions, such as an association between mean daily air and grass temperatures with the abundance of spoilage taxa like
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>
              species. Correlations were identified between pathogenic, mastitis-related species, fat content, and the number of sun hours, suggesting a seasonal effect. Ultimately, this study expands our understanding of the interconnected nature of the microbiota, environment/climate variables, and chemical composition of raw milk and provides evidence of a season- and location-specific microbiota.

            <jats:p>The microbiota of raw milk is influenced by many factors that encourage or prevent the introduction and growth of both beneficial and undesirable microorganisms. The seasonal and geographical impacts on the microbial communities of raw milk have been previously seen, but the relationships with environmental factors and the chemical composition has yet to be investigated. In this year-long study, we found that while raw milk is highly diverse, a core microbiota was detected for Irish raw milk, with strong evidence of seasonal and geographical influence. We also found associations between groups of microorganisms, environmental factors, and milk composition, which expand current knowledge on the relationships between microbial and chemical composition and the climate. These results provide evidence for the development of a tool to allow for the prediction of raw milk quality and safety.</jats:p>

              employs a set of enzymes containing cysteine (Cys) instead of Sec. The genes coding for these Sec-/Cys-containing isoforms were the only genes known of which expression is influenced by the selenium status of the cell. Using proteomics and transcriptomics, approx. 7% and 12%, respectively, of all genes/proteins were found differentially expressed/synthesized in response to the selenium supply. Some of the genes identified involve methanogenesis, nitrogenase functions, and putative transporters. An increase of transcript abundance for putative transporters under selenium depletion indicated the organism’s effort to tap into alternative sources of selenium.

However, whether and how mucin could rescue fiber deprivation-induced intestinal barrier defects remains largely unexplored. Here, we sought to investigate the potential role and mechanism by which exogenous mucin maintains the gut barrier function. The results showed that dietary mucin alleviated fiber deprivation-induced disruption of colonic barrier integrity and reduced spermine production

Other phosphomodifications on Cys, Glu, and Lys remain largely unexplored.

              The gut microbiome affects the health status of the host through complex interactions with the host’s intestinal wall. These host-microbiome interactions may spatially vary along the physical and chemical environment of the intestine, but these changes remain unknown. This study investigated these intricate relationships through a gene co-expression network analysis based on dual transcriptome profiling of different intestinal sites—cecum, transverse colon, and rectum—of the primate common marmoset. We proposed a gene module extraction algorithm based on the graph theory to find tightly interacting gene modules of the host and the microbiome from a vast co-expression network. The 27 gene modules identified by this method, which include both host and microbiome genes, not only produced results consistent with previous studies regarding the host-microbiome relationships, but also provided new insights into microbiome genes acting as potential mediators in host-microbiome interplays. Specifically, we discovered associations between the host gene

              Algal blooms can give snowmelt a red color, reducing snow albedo and creating a runaway effect that accelerates snow melting. The occurrence of red snow is predicted to grow in polar and subpolar regions with increasing global temperatures. We hypothesize that these algal blooms affect virus-bacteria interactions in snow, with potential effects on snowmelt dynamics. A genomic analysis of double-stranded DNA virus communities in red and white snow from the Whistler region of British Columbia, Canada, identified 792 putative viruses infecting bacteria. The most abundant putative snow viruses displayed low genomic similarity with known viruses. We recovered the complete circular genomes of nine putative viruses, two of which were classified as temperate. Putative snow viruses encoded genes involved in energy metabolisms, such as NAD
              <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>
              synthesis and salvage pathways. In model phages, these genes facilitate increased viral particle production and lysis rates. The frequency of temperate phages was positively correlated with microbial abundance in the snow samples. These results suggest the increased frequency of temperate virus-bacteria interactions as microbial densities increase during snowmelt. We propose that this virus-bacteria dynamic may facilitate the red snow algae growth stimulated by bacteria.

These results are contextualized using the composition and functions observed in the bacterial communities from the same snow samples. Together, these data demonstrate the energy metabolism performed by viruses and bacteria in a snow algal bloom, as well as expand the overall knowledge of viral genomes in extreme environments.</jats:p>

In contrast, HaCaT cells emphasized barrier integrity and immune activation. We also observe bacterial modulation of host processes and metabolic shifts.

              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              strains, including five clinical isolates from the lung secretions of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). We provide three vignettes illustrating how secondary metabolite profiling aids in the identification of rare genomics traits in

              Most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) encoding the synthesis of important microbial secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, are either silent or poorly expressed; therefore, to ensure a strong pipeline of novel antibiotics, there is a need to develop rapid and efficient strain development approaches. This study uses comparative genome analysis to instruct rational strain improvement, using
              <jats:italic>Streptomyces rimosus</jats:italic>
              , the producer of the important antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) as a model system. Sequencing of the genomes of two industrial strains M4018 and R6-500, developed independently from a common ancestor, identified large DNA rearrangements located at the chromosome end. We evaluated the effect of these genome deletions on the parental
              <jats:italic>S. rimosus</jats:italic>
              Type Strain (ATCC 10970) genome where introduction of a 145 kb deletion close to the OTC BGC in the Type Strain resulted in massive OTC overproduction, achieving titers that were equivalent to M4018 and R6-500. Transcriptome data supported the hypothesis that the reason for such an increase in OTC biosynthesis was due to enhanced transcription of the OTC BGC and not due to enhanced substrate supply. We also observed changes in the expression of other cryptic BGCs; some metabolites, undetectable in ATCC 10970, were now produced at high titers. This study demonstrated for the first time that the main force behind BGC overexpression is genome rearrangement. This new approach demonstrates great potential to activate cryptic gene clusters of yet unexplored natural products of medical and industrial value.

                species are very rich source of antibiotics, typically encoding 20–60 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, under laboratory conditions, most are either silent or poorly expressed so that their products are only detectable at nanogram quantities, which hampers drug development efforts.

                strains producing high titers of a broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC), developed during decades of industrial strain improvement.

              Invertebrates constitute the majority of animal species on Earth, including most disease-causing agents or vectors, with more diverse viromes when compared to vertebrates. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have significantly expanded our understanding of invertebrate viruses, yet this knowledge remains biased toward a few well-studied animal lineages. In this study, we analyze invertebrate DNA and RNA viromes for 31 phyla using 417 publicly available RNA-Seq data sets from diverse environments in the marine-terrestrial and marine-freshwater gradients. This study aims to (i) estimate virome compositions at the family level for the first time across the animal tree of life, including the first exploration of the virome in several phyla, (ii) quantify the diversity of invertebrate viromes and characterize the structure of invertebrate-virus infection networks, and (iii) investigate host phylum and habitat influence on virome differences. Results showed that a set of few viral families of eukaryotes, comprising

              , and several families of giant DNA viruses, were ubiquitous and highly abundant. Nevertheless, some differences emerged between phyla, revealing for instance a less diverse virome in Ctenophora compared to the other animal phyla. Compositional analysis of the viromes showed that the host phylum explained over five times more variance in composition than its habitat. Moreover, significant similarities were observed between the viromes of some phylogenetically related phyla, which could highlight the influence of co-evolution in shaping invertebrate viromes.

              Seed endophytic microbiomes are shaped by host and environmental factors and play a crucial role in their host growth and health. Studies have demonstrated that host genotype, including hybridization, affects seed microbiomes. Heterosis features are also observed in root-associated microbiomes. It remains unclear, however, whether heterosis exists in seed endophytic microbiomes and whether hybrid microbiota provide noticeable advantages to host plant growth, especially to seed germination. Here, we investigated the structure of seed endophytic bacterial and fungal communities from three hybrid rice varieties and their respective parents using amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA and ITS2 genes. Heterosis was found in diversity and composition of seed endophytic microbiomes in hybrids, which hosted more diverse communities and significantly higher abundances of plant growth-promoting taxa, such as
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Rhizobium</jats:italic>
              genera compared with their parental lines. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that there are potentially tighter microbial interactions in the hybrid seeds compared with their parent seeds. Finally, inoculation of seed-cultivable endophytes, isolated from hybrids, resulted in a greater promotion of seed germination compared with those isolated from parent lines. These findings suggest that heterosis exists not only in plant traits but also in seed endophytic microbiota, the latter in turn promotes seed germination, which offers valuable guidance for microbiome-assisted rice breeding.

              <jats:p>Genetic and physiological changes associated with plant hybridization have been studied for many crop species. Still, little is known about the impact of hybridization on the seed microbiota. In this study, we indicate that hybridization has a significant impact on the endophytic bacterial and fungal communities in rice seeds. The seed endophytic microbiomes of hybrids displayed distinct characteristics from those of their parental lines and exhibited potential heterosis features. Furthermore, the inoculation of seed-cultivable endophytes isolated from hybrids exhibited a greater promotion effect on seed germination compared with those isolated from the parents. Our findings make a valuable contribution to the emerging field of microbiome-assisted plant breeding, highlighting the potential for a targeted approach that aims to achieve not only desired plant traits but also plant-beneficial microbial communities on the seeds.</jats:p>

              Corals establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms, especially endosymbiotic photosynthetic algae. Although other microbes have been commonly detected in coral tissues, their identity and beneficial functions for their host are unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial outcomes of the inoculation of bacteria selected as probiotics and use fluorescence

              Despite the promising results indicating the beneficial outcomes associated with the application of probiotics in corals and some scarce knowledge regarding the identity of bacterial cells found within the coral tissue, the correlation between these two aspects is still missing. This gap limits our understanding of the actual diversity of coral-associated bacteria and whether these symbionts are beneficial. Some researchers, for example, have been suggesting that probiotic screening should only focus on the very few known tissue-associated bacteria, such as
              <jats:italic>Endozoicomonas</jats:italic>
              sp., assuming that the currently tested probiotics are not tissue-associated. Here, we provide specific FISH probes for

The presence of these beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) inside host tissues and gastric cavities also supports the notion that direct interactions with the host may underpin their probiotic role. This is a new breakthrough; these results argue against the possibility that the positive effects of BMCs are due to factors that are not related to a direct symbiotic interaction, for example, that the host simply feeds on inoculated bacteria or that the bacteria change the water quality.

We designed a novel method called micro target hybrid capture system (MT-Capture) to enable whole-genome sequencing in a timely manner. The novel design of probes used in target binding exhibits a unique and synergistic “hand-in-hand” conjugation effect. The entire hybrid capture process is within 2.5 hours, overcoming the time-consuming and complex operation characteristics of the traditional liquid-phase hybrid capture (T-Capture) system. By designing specific probes for these coronaviruses, MT-Capture effectively enriched isolated strains and 112 clinical samples of coronaviruses with cycle threshold values below 37. Compared to multiplex PCR sequencing, it does not require frequent primer updates and has higher compatibility. MT-Capture is highly sensitive and capable of tracking variants.</jats:p>

This method utilizes innovative probe designs optimized through probe conjugation techniques, greatly shortening the time and simplifying the handwork compared with traditional hybridization capture processes. Our results demonstrate that MT-Capture surpasses multiplex PCR in terms of sensitivity, exhibiting a thousandfold increase. Moreover, MT-Capture excels in the identification of mutation sites.

              The efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics (synbiotics when combined) to improve symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has shown considerable inter-study variation, likely due to the complex, heterogeneous nature of the disorder and its associated behavioral, developmental, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Here, we present a precision synbiotic supplementation study in 296 children and adults diagnosed with ASD versus 123 age-matched neurotypical controls. One hundred seventy ASD participants completed the study. Baseline and post-synbiotic assessment of ASD and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and deep metagenomic sequencing were performed. Within the ASD cohort, there were significant differences in microbes between subpopulations based on the social responsiveness scale (SRS2) survey (

              compared to controls. Following the 3-month synbiotic supplementation, the ASD cohort showed increased taxonomic alpha diversity, shifts in taxonomy and metabolic pathway potential, and improvements in some ASD-related symptoms, including a significant reduction in GI discomfort and overall improved language, comprehension, cognition, thinking, and speech. However, the open-label study design may include some placebo effects. In summary, we found that precision synbiotics modulated the gut microbiome and could be used as supplementation to improve gastrointestinal and ASD-related symptoms.

              Microbial communities in nature are dynamically evolving as member species change their interactions subject to environmental variations. Accounting for such context-dependent dynamic variations in interspecies interactions is critical for predictive ecological modeling. In the absence of generalizable theoretical foundations, we lack a fundamental understanding of how microbial interactions are driven by environmental factors, significantly limiting our capability to predict and engineer community dynamics and function. To address this issue, we propose a novel theoretical framework that allows us to represent interspecies interactions as an explicit function of environmental variables (such as substrate concentrations) by combining growth kinetics and a generalized Lotka-Volterra model. A synergistic integration of these two complementary models leads to the prediction of alterations in interspecies interactions as the outcome of dynamic balances between positive and negative influences of microbial species in mixed relationships. The effectiveness of our method was experimentally demonstrated using a synthetic consortium of two
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              mutants that are metabolically dependent (due to an inability to synthesize essential amino acids) but competitively grow on a shared substrate. The analysis of the
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              binary consortium using our model not only showed how interactions between the two amino acid auxotrophic mutants are controlled by the dynamic shifts in limiting substrates but also enabled quantifying previously uncharacterizable complex aspects of microbial interactions, such as asymmetry in interactions. Our approach can be extended to other ecological systems to model their environment-dependent interspecies interactions from growth kinetics.

              The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) system widely occurs in prokaryotic organisms to recognize and destruct genetic invaders. Systematic collation and characterization of endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems are conducive to our understanding and potential utilization of this natural genetic machinery. In this study, we screened 39 complete and 692 incomplete genomes of myxobacteria using a combined strategy to dispose of the abridged genome information and revealed at least 19 CRISPR-Cas subtypes, which were distributed with a taxonomic difference and often lost stochastically in intraspecies strains. The
              <jats:italic>cas</jats:italic>
              genes in each subtype were evolutionarily clustered but deeply separated, while most of the CRISPRs were divided into four types based on the motif characteristics of repeat sequences. The spacers recorded in myxobacterial CRISPRs were in high G+C content, matching lots of phages, tiny amounts of plasmids, and, surprisingly, massive organismic genomes. We experimentally demonstrated the immune and self-target immune activities of three endogenous systems in

              Polymyxin is used as a last resort antibiotics for infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria and is often combined with other antibiotics to improve clinical effectiveness. However, the synergism of colistin and other antibiotics remains obscure. Here, we revealed a notable synergy between colistin and flavomycin, which was traditionally used as an animal growth promoter and has limited activity against Gram-negative bacteria, using checkerboard assay and time–kill curve analyses. The importance of membrane penetration induced by colistin was assessed by examining the intracellular accumulation of flavomycin and its antimicrobial impact on
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              (

              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              outer membrane by colistin, leading to increased intracellular accumulation of flavomycin and enhanced cell killing thereafter. The observed synergy was dependent on the antimicrobial activity of flavomycin, as mutation of its binding site abolished the synergy.

Previous studies have found that colistin can synergy with various drugs; however, its exact mechanisms with hydrophobic drugs are still unrevealed. Generally, the membrane destruction of colistin is thought to be the essential trigger for its interactions with its partner drugs. Here, we use clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) for specifically mutating the binding site of one hydrophobic drug (flavomycin) and show that antimicrobial activity of flavomycin is critical for the synergy.

              Bacterial phage shock protein (PSP) systems stabilize the bacterial cell membrane and protect against envelope stress. These systems have been associated with virulence, but despite their critical roles, PSP components are not well characterized outside proteobacteria. Using comparative genomics and protein sequence-structure-function analyses, we systematically identified and analyzed PSP homologs, phyletic patterns, domain architectures, and gene neighborhoods. This approach underscored the evolutionary significance of the system, revealing that its core protein PspA (Snf7 in ESCRT outside bacteria) was present in the last universal common ancestor and that this ancestral functionality has since diversified into multiple novel, distinct PSP systems across life. Several novel partners of the PSP system were identified: (i) the Toastrack domain, likely facilitating assembly of sub-membrane stress-sensing and signaling complexes, (ii) the newly defined HTH-associated α-helical signaling domain-PadR-like transcriptional regulator pair system, and (iii) multiple independent associations with ATPase, CesT/Tir-like chaperone, and Band-7 domains in proteins thought to mediate sub-membrane dynamics. Our work also uncovered links between the PSP components and other domains, such as novel variants of SHOCT-like domains, suggesting roles in assembling membrane-associated complexes of proteins with disparate biochemical functions.

              <jats:p>Phage shock proteins (PSP) are virulence-associated, cell membrane stress-protective systems. They have mostly been characterized in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We now show that a minimal PSP system was present in the last universal common ancestor that evolved and diversified into newly identified functional contexts. Recognizing the conservation and evolution of PSP systems across bacterial phyla contributes to our understanding of stress response mechanisms in prokaryotes. Moreover, the newly discovered PSP modularity will likely prompt new studies of lineage-specific cell envelope structures, lifestyles, and adaptation mechanisms. Finally, our results validate the use of domain architecture and genetic context for discovery in comparative genomics.</jats:p>

              A comprehensive pangenomic approach was employed to analyze the genomes of 75 type II methylotrophs spanning various genera. Our investigation revealed 256 exact core gene families shared by all 75 organisms, emphasizing their crucial role in the survival and adaptability of these organisms. Additionally, we predicted the functionality of 12 hypothetical proteins. The analysis unveiled a diverse array of genes associated with key metabolic pathways, including methane, serine, glyoxylate, and ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) metabolic pathways. While all selected organisms possessed essential genes for the serine pathway,
              <jats:italic>Methylooceanibacter marginalis</jats:italic>
              lacked serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and
              <jats:italic>Methylobacterium variabile</jats:italic>
              exhibited both isozymes of SHMT, suggesting its potential to utilize a broader range of carbon sources. Notably,
              <jats:italic>Methylobrevis</jats:italic>
              sp. displayed a unique serine-glyoxylate transaminase isozyme not found in other organisms. Only nine organisms featured anaplerotic enzymes (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) for the glyoxylate pathway, with the rest following the EMC pathway.
              <jats:italic>Methylovirgula</jats:italic>
              sp. 4MZ18 stood out by acquiring genes from both glyoxylate and EMC pathways, and
              <jats:italic>Methylocapsa</jats:italic>
              sp. S129 featured an A-form malate synthase, unlike the G-form found in the remaining organisms. Our findings also revealed distinct phylogenetic relationships and clustering patterns among type II methylotrophs, leading to the proposal of a separate genus for
              <jats:italic>Methylovirgula</jats:italic>

              Methylotrophs have played a significant role in methane-based product production for many years. However, a comprehensive investigation into the diverse genetic architectures across different genera of methylotrophs has been lacking. This study fills this knowledge gap by enhancing our understanding of core hypothetical proteins and unique enzymes involved in methane oxidation, serine, glyoxylate, and ethylmalonyl-CoA pathways. These findings provide a valuable reference for researchers working with other methylotrophic species. Furthermore, this study not only unveils distinctive gene characteristics and phylogenetic relationships but also suggests a reclassification for

              In arthropod-associated microbial communities, insect-specific viruses (ISVs) are prevalent yet understudied due to limited infectivity outside their natural hosts. However, ISVs might play a crucial role in regulating mosquito populations and influencing arthropod-borne virus transmission. Some studies have indicated a core virome in mosquitoes consisting of mostly ISVs. Employing single mosquito metagenomics, we comprehensively profiled the virome of native and invasive mosquito species in Belgium. This approach allowed for accurate host species determination, prevalence assessment of viruses and
              <jats:italic>Wolbachia</jats:italic>
              , and the identification of novel viruses. Contrary to our expectations, no abundant core virome was observed in
              <jats:italic>Culex</jats:italic>
              mosquitoes from Belgium. In that regard, we caution against rigidly defining mosquito core viromes and encourage nuanced interpretations of other studies. Nonetheless, our study identified 45 viruses of which 28 were novel, enriching our understanding of the mosquito virome and ISVs. We showed that the mosquito virome in this study is species-specific and less dependent on the location where mosquitoes from the same species reside. In addition, because

              Most of Earth’s trees rely on critical soil nutrients that ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) liberate and provide, and all of Earth’s land plants associate with bacteria that help them survive in nature. Yet, our understanding of how the presence of EcMF modifies soil bacterial communities, soil food webs, and root chemistry requires direct experimental evidence to comprehend the effects that EcMF may generate in the belowground plant microbiome. To this end, we grew
              <jats:italic>Pinus muricata</jats:italic>
              plants in soils that were either inoculated with EcMF and native forest bacterial communities or only native bacterial communities. We then profiled the soil bacterial communities, applied metabolomics and lipidomics, and linked omics data sets to understand how the presence of EcMF modifies belowground biogeochemistry, bacterial community structure, and their functional potential. We found that the presence of EcMF (i) enriches soil bacteria linked to enhanced plant growth in nature, (ii) alters the quantity and composition of lipid and non-lipid soil metabolites, and (iii) modifies plant root chemistry toward pathogen suppression, enzymatic conservation, and reactive oxygen species scavenging. Using this multi-omic approach, we therefore show that this widespread fungal symbiosis may be a common factor for structuring soil food webs.

              <jats:p>Understanding how soil microbes interact with one another and their host plant will help us combat the negative effects that climate change has on terrestrial ecosystems. Unfortunately, we lack a clear understanding of how the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF)—one of the most dominant soil microbial groups on Earth—shapes belowground organic resources and the composition of bacterial communities. To address this knowledge gap, we profiled lipid and non-lipid metabolites in soils and plant roots, characterized soil bacterial communities, and compared soils amended either with or without EcMF. Our results show that the presence of EcMF changes soil organic resource availability, impacts the proliferation of different bacterial communities (in terms of both type and potential function), and primes plant root chemistry for pathogen suppression and energy conservation. Our findings therefore provide much-needed insight into how two of the most dominant soil microbial groups interact with one another and with their host plant.</jats:p>

We assessed the gut microbiome in 64 fecal samples from end-stage lung disease patients before transplantation and 219 samples from lung transplant recipients after transplantation using metagenomic sequencing. To identify dysbiotic microbial signatures, we analyzed 243 fecal samples from age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. By unsupervised clustering, we identified five groups of lung transplant recipients using different combinations of immunosuppressants and antibiotics and analyzed them in relation to the gut microbiome. Finally, we investigated the gut microbiome of lung transplant recipients in different chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) stages and longitudinal gut microbiome changes after transplantation. We found 108 species (58.1%) in end-stage lung disease patients and 139 species (74.7%) in lung transplant recipients that were differentially abundant compared with healthy controls, with several species exhibiting sharp longitudinal increases from before to after transplantation. Different combinations of immunosuppressants and antibiotics were associated with specific gut microbial signatures. We found that the gut microbiome of lung transplant recipients in CLAD stage 0 was more similar to healthy controls compared to those in CLAD stage 1. Finally, the gut microbial diversity of lung transplant recipients remained lower than the average gut microbial diversity of healthy controls up to more than 20 years post-transplantation.

              Temperate bacteriophages (phages) are common features of bacterial genomes and can act as self-amplifying biological weapons, killing susceptible competitors and thus increasing the fitness of their bacterial hosts (lysogens). Despite their prevalence, however, the key characteristics of an effective temperate phage weapon remain unclear. Here, we use systematic mathematical analyses coupled with experimental tests to understand what makes an effective temperate phage weapon. We find that effectiveness is controlled by phage life history traits—in particular, the probability of lysis and induction rate—but that the optimal combination of traits varies with the initial frequency of a lysogen within a population. As a consequence, certain phage weapons can be detrimental when their hosts are rare yet beneficial when their hosts are common, while subtle changes in individual life history traits can completely reverse the impact of an individual phage weapon on lysogen fitness. We confirm key predictions of our model experimentally, using temperate phages isolated from the clinically relevant Liverpool epidemic strain of
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              . Through these experiments, we further demonstrate that nutrient availability can also play a critical role in driving frequency-dependent patterns in phage-mediated competition. Together, these findings highlight the complex and context-dependent nature of temperate phage weapons and the importance of both ecological and evolutionary processes in shaping microbial community dynamics more broadly.

Bacterial hosts that carry temperate bacteriophages can thus gain a fitness advantage within a given niche by killing competitors. But what makes an effective phage weapon? Here, we first use a simple mathematical model to explore the factors determining bacteriophage weapon utility. Our models suggest that bacteriophage weapons are nuanced and context-dependent; an individual bacteriophage may be beneficial or costly depending upon tiny changes to how it behaves or the bacterial community it inhabits. We then confirm these mathematical predictions experimentally, using phages isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. But, in doing so, we also find that another factor—nutrient availability—plays a key role in shaping bacteriophage-mediated competition. Together, our results provide new insights into how temperate bacteriophages modulate bacterial communities.</jats:p>

              Microorganisms play a central role in sustaining soil ecosystems and agriculture, and these functions are usually associated with their complex life history. Yet, the regulation and evolution of life history have remained enigmatic and poorly understood, especially in protozoa, the third most abundant group of organisms in the soil. Here, we explore the life history of a cosmopolitan species—
              <jats:italic>Colpoda steinii</jats:italic>
              . Our analysis has yielded a high-quality macronuclear genome for
              <jats:italic>C. steinii</jats:italic>
              , with size of 155 Mbp and 37,123 protein-coding genes, as well as mean intron length of ~93 bp, longer than most other studied ciliates. Notably, we identify two possible whole-genome duplication events in
              <jats:italic>C. steinii</jats:italic>
              , which may account for its genome being about twice the size of

While the translation-related genes are upregulated during the excystment of resting cysts. Reproductive cysts exhibit a significant reduction in cell adhesion. We also demonstrate that most genes expressed in specific life stages are under strong purifying selection. This study offers a deeper understanding of the life history evolution that underpins the extraordinary success and ecological functions of microorganisms in soil ecosystems.

This investigation reveals their exceptional macronuclear genomic features, including significantly large genome size, long introns, and numerous gene duplications. The gene expression profiles and the specific biological functions associated with the transitions between various life stages are also elucidated. The vast majority of genes linked to life stage transitions are subject to strong purifying selection, as inferred from multiple natural strains newly isolated and deeply sequenced.

Morphological analysis via transmission electron microscopy revealed slightly larger Neff EVs (average = 194.5 nm) compared to more polydisperse T4 EVs (average = 168.4 nm). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and dynamic light scattering validated these differences. Proteomic analysis of the EVs identified 1,352 proteins, with 1,107 common, 161 exclusive in Neff, and 84 exclusively in T4 EVs. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping revealed distinct molecular functions and biological processes and notably, the T4 EVs enrichment in serine proteases, aligned with its pathogenicity. Lipidomic analysis revealed a prevalence of unsaturated lipid species in Neff EVs, particularly triacylglycerols, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and phosphatidylserine, while T4 EVs were enriched in diacylglycerols and diacylglyceryl trimethylhomoserine, phosphatidylcholine and less unsaturated PEs, suggesting differences in lipid metabolism and membrane permeability. Metabolomic analysis indicated Neff EVs enrichment in glycerolipid metabolism, glycolysis, and nucleotide synthesis, while T4 EVs, methionine metabolism. Furthermore, RNA-seq of EVs revealed differential transcript between the strains, with Neff EVs enriched in transcripts related to gluconeogenesis and translation, suggesting gene regulation and metabolic shift, while in the T4 EVs transcripts were associated with signal transduction and protein kinase activity, indicating rapid responses to environmental changes.

              Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) have developed distinct ecological strategies to obtain reduced sulfur compounds for growth. These range from specialists that can only use a limited range of reduced sulfur compounds to generalists that can use many different forms as electron donors. Forming intimate symbioses with animal hosts is another highly successful ecological strategy for SOB, as animals, through their behavior and physiology, can enable access to sulfur compounds. Symbioses have evolved multiple times in a range of animal hosts and from several lineages of SOB. They have successfully colonized a wide range of habitats, from seagrass beds to hydrothermal vents, with varying availability of symbiont energy sources. Our extensive analyses of sulfur transformation pathways in 234 genomes of symbiotic and free-living SOB revealed widespread conservation in metabolic pathways for sulfur oxidation in symbionts from different host species and environments, raising the question of how they have adapted to such a wide range of distinct habitats. We discovered a gene family expansion of
              <jats:italic>soxY</jats:italic>
              in these genomes, with up to five distinct copies per genome. Symbionts harboring only the “canonical”

              were typically ecological “specialists” that are associated with specific host subfamilies or environments (e.g., hydrothermal vents, mangroves). Conversely, symbionts with multiple divergent
              <jats:italic>soxY</jats:italic>
              genes formed versatile associations across diverse hosts in various marine environments. We hypothesize that expansion and diversification of the

In the millions of years since they evolved, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria have adopted several highly successful strategies; some are ecological “specialists,” and some are “generalists,” but which genetic features underpin these ecological strategies are not well understood.

However, the impact of SLs on root-associated microbial communities in response to P availability remains unknown. Here, root microbiota of SL biosynthesis (

Using high-throughput sequencing, the relationship between SLs, P concentrations, and the root-associated microbiota was investigated to reveal the variation in microbial diversity, composition, and interaction. Plant genotypes and P availability played important but different roles in shaping the root-associated microbial community. Importantly, SLs were found to attract

Moreover, SLs could change the topologic structure within co-occurrence networks and increase the number of keystone taxa (e.g., Rhizobiaceae and Acidobacteriaceae) to enhance microbial community stability. This study reveals the key role of SLs in mediating root-associated microbiota interactions.

              The gut microbiota contributes to skeletal muscle energy metabolism and is an indirect factor affecting meat quality. However, the role of specific gut microbes in energy metabolism and fiber size of skeletal muscle in chickens remains largely unknown. In this study, we first performed cecal microbiota transplantation from Chinese indigenous Jingyuan chickens (JY) to Arbor Acres chickens (AA), to determine the effects of microbiota on skeletal muscle fiber and energy metabolism. Then, we used metagenomics, gas chromatography, and metabolomics analysis to identify functional microbes. Finally, we validated the role of these functional microbes in regulating the fiber size via glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle of chickens through feeding experiments. The results showed that the skeletal muscle characteristics of AA after microbiota transplantation tended to be consistent with that of JY, as the fiber diameter was significantly increased, and glucose metabolism level was significantly enhanced in the pectoralis muscle.

              Probiotics and synbiotics have been intensively used in animal husbandry due to their advantageous roles in animals’ health. However, there is a paucity of research on probiotic and synbiotic supplementation from maternal gestation to the postnatal growing phases of offspring piglets. Thus, we assessed the effects of dietary supplementation of these two additives to sows and offspring piglets on skeletal muscle and body metabolism, colonic microbiota composition, and metabolite profiles of offspring piglets. Pregnant Bama mini-pigs and their offspring piglets (after weaning) were fed either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with antibiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics. At 65, 95, and 125 days old, eight pigs per group were euthanized and sampled for analyses. Probiotics increased the intramuscular fat content in the psoas major muscle (PMM) at 95 days old, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and n-3 PUFA levels in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) at 65 days old, C16:1 level in the LDM at 125 days old, and upregulated

              <jats:italic>HSL</jats:italic>
              expressions in the PMM at 65 days old. Synbiotics increased the plasma HDL-C level at 65 days old and TC level at 65 and 125 days old and upregulated the
              <jats:italic>CPT-1</jats:italic>
              expression in the PMM at 125 days old. In addition, probiotics and synbiotics increased the plasma levels of HDL-C at 65 days old, CHE at 95 days old, and LDL-C at 125 days old, while decreasing the C18:1n9t level in the PMM at 65 days old and the plasma levels of GLU, LDH, and TG at 95 days old. Microbiome analysis showed that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation increased colonic Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia,
              <jats:italic>Faecalibacterium</jats:italic>
              ,

              <jats:italic>Unclassified_Lachnospiraceae</jats:italic>
              abundances. Furthermore, probiotic and synbiotic supplementation was associated with alterations in 8, 7, and 10 differential metabolites at three different age stages. Both microbiome and metabolome analyses showed that the differential metabolic pathways were associated with carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. However, antibiotic supplementation increased the C18:1n9t level in the PMM at 65 days old and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism at 125 days old. In conclusion, sow-offspring’s diets supplemented with these two additives showed conducive effects on meat flavor, nutritional composition of skeletal muscles, and body metabolism, which may be associated with the reshaping of colonic microbiota and metabolites. However, antibiotic supplementation has negative effects on colonic microbiota composition and fatty acid composition in the PMM.

              The integral sow-offspring probiotic and synbiotic supplementation improves the meat flavor and the fatty acid composition of the LDM to some extent.

              The emergence of nosocomial infections caused by hypervirulent and carbapenem-resistant
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              (hv-CRKP) has become a significant public health challenge. The genetic traits of virulence and resistance plasmids in hv-CRKP have been extensively studied; however, research on the adaptive evolution strategies of clinical strains inside the host was scarce. This study aimed to understand the effects of antibiotic treatment on the phenotype and genotype characteristics of hv-CRKP. We investigated the evolution of hv-CRKP strains isolated from the same patient to elucidate the transition between hospital invasion and colonization. A comparative genomics analysis was performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              promoter. Subsequent validation through RNA-seq and gene deletion confirmed that distinct
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              promoter sequences exert control over the mucoid phenotype. Additionally, biofilm experiments, cell adhesion assays, and animal infection models were conducted to illuminate the influence of
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              promoter diversity on virulence changes. We demonstrated that the P12T and P11T promoters of
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              possess strong activity, which leads to the evolution of CRKP into infectious and virulent strains. Meanwhile, the specific sequence of polyT motifs in the
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              promoter led to a decrease in the lethality of hv-CRKP and enhanced cell adhesion and colonization. To summarize, the
              <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
              promoter of hv-CRKP is utilized to control capsule production, thereby modifying pathogenicity to better suit the host’s ecological environment.

                (hv-CRKP) is significant, leading to prolonged antibiotic treatment. However, there are few reports on the phenotypic changes of hv-CRKP in patients undergoing antibiotic treatment. We performed a comprehensive examination of the genetic evolutionary traits of hv-CRKP obtained from the same patient and observed variations in the promoter sequences of the virulence factor
                <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
                . The strong activity of the promoter sequences P11T and P12T enhances the consistent production of capsule polysaccharides, resulting in an invasive strain. Conversely, weak promoter activity of P9T and P10T is advantageous for exposing pili, hence improving bacterial cell attachment ability and facilitating bacterial colonization. This finding also explains the confusion of some clinical strains carrying wild-type
                <jats:italic>rmpA</jats:italic>
                but exhibiting a low mucoid phenotype. This adaptive alteration facilitates the dissemination of

              <jats:italic>A. baumannii</jats:italic>
              . Here, a library of 11,648 natural compounds was subjected to a primary screening using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models generated from a ChEMBL data set with &gt;7,000 compounds with their reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against

              followed by a structure-based virtual screening against OmpW.
              <jats:italic>In silico</jats:italic>
              pharmacokinetic evaluation was conducted to assess the drug-likeness of these compounds. The ten highest-ranking compounds were found to bind with an energy score ranging from −7.8 to −7.0 kcal/mol where most of them belonged to curcuminoids. To validate these findings, one lead compound exhibiting promising binding stability as well as favorable pharmacokinetics properties, namely demethoxycurcumin, was tested against a panel of
              <jats:italic>A. baumannii</jats:italic>
              strains to determine its antibacterial activity using microdilution and time-kill curve assays. To validate whether the compound binds to the selected target, an OmpW-deficient mutant was studied and compared with the wild type. Our results demonstrate that demethoxycurcumin in monotherapy and in combination with colistin is active against all
              <jats:italic>A. baumannii</jats:italic>
              strains. Finally, the compound was found to significantly reduce the

              interaction with host cells, suggesting its anti-virulence properties. Collectively, this study demonstrates machine learning as a promising strategy for the discovery of curcuminoids as antimicrobial agents for combating

            <jats:p>The composition of the human gut microbiome varies tremendously among individuals, making the effects of dietary or treatment interventions difficult to detect and characterize. The consumption of fiber is important for gut health, yet the specific effects of increased fiber intake on the gut microbiome vary across studies. The variation in study outcomes might be due to inter-individual (or inter-population) variation or to the details of the interventions including the types of fiber, length of study, size of cohort, and molecular approaches. Thus, to identify generally (on average) consistent fiber-induced responses in the gut microbiome of healthy individuals, we re-analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from 21 dietary fiber interventions from 12 human studies, which included 2,564 fecal samples from 538 subjects across all interventions. Short-term increases in dietary fiber consumption resulted in highly consistent gut bacterial community responses across studies. Increased fiber consumption explained an average of 1.5% of compositional variation (vs 82% of variation attributed to the individual), reduced alpha-diversity, and resulted in phylogenetically conserved responses in relative abundances among bacterial taxa. Additionally, we identified bacterial clades, at approximately the genus level, that were highly consistent in their response (on average, increasing or decreasing in their relative abundance) to dietary fiber interventions across the studies.</jats:p>

              Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a crucial public health tool for population-level pathogen surveillance. Supported by funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the FDA‘s genomic epidemiology program, GenomeTrakr, was leveraged to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater sites across the United States. This initiative required the evaluation, optimization, development, and publication of new methods and analytical tools spanning sample collection through variant analyses. Version-controlled protocols for each step of the process were developed and published on protocols.io. A custom data analysis tool and a publicly accessible dashboard were built to facilitate real-time visualization of the collected data, focusing on the relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-lineages across different samples and sites throughout the project. From September 2021 through June 2023, a total of 3,389 wastewater samples were collected, with 2,517 undergoing sequencing and submission to NCBI under the umbrella BioProject,

              . Sequence data were released with explicit quality control (QC) tags on all sequence records, communicating our confidence in the quality of data. Variant analysis revealed wide circulation of Delta in the fall of 2021 and captured the sweep of Omicron and subsequent diversification of this lineage through the end of the sampling period. This project successfully achieved two important goals for the FDA’s GenomeTrakr program: first, contributing timely genomic data for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response, and second, establishing both capacity and best practices for culture-independent, population-level environmental surveillance for other pathogens of interest to the FDA.

Of note, we identified the formation of a novel Guangdong clade (Bayesian analysis of population structure lineage 1 [BAPS1]) genetically diversified from the global isolates and likely emerged around 1990s.

Furthermore, high genetic similarity was found between strains collected from Guangdong, Europe, and North America, indicating the association with multiple introductions from overseas. These results suggested that global dissemination and local clonal expansion simultaneously occurred in Guangdong, China, and horizontally acquired resistance to first-line and last-line antimicrobials at local level, underlying emergences of extensive drug and pan-drug resistance.

This species is of biotechnological importance because it is the primary yeast used in lager beer fermentation and is also a key model for studying the evolution of hybrid genomes, including expression pattern of ortholog genes, composition of protein complexes, and phenotypic plasticity.

The iSP_1513 comprises 4,062 reactions, 1,808 alleles, and 2,747 metabolites, and takes into account the functional redundancy in the gene-protein-reaction rule caused by the presence of orthologous genes. Moreover, a universal algorithm to constrain GSMM reactions using transcriptome data was developed as a python library and enabled the integration of temperature as parameter. Essentiality data sets, growth data on various carbohydrates and volatile metabolites secretion were used to validate the model and showed the potential of media engineering to improve specific flavor compounds. The iSP_1513 also highlighted the different contributions of the parental sub-genomes to the oxidative and non-oxidative parts of the pentose phosphate pathway.

              is far from uniform, with 22 global regulator (GR) proteins controlling one-third of all genes. So far, their production rates cannot be tracked by comparable fluorescent proteins. We developed a library of fluorescent reporters for 16 GRs for this purpose. Each consists of a single-copy plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the full-length copy of the native promoter. We tracked their activity in exponential and stationary growth, as well as under weak and strong stresses. We show that the reporters have high sensitivity and specificity to all stresses tested and detect single-cell variability in transcription rates. Given the influence of GRs on the TFN, we expect that the new library will contribute to dissecting global transcriptional stress-response programs of
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>

                Cells contain thousands of genes. Many genes are involved in the control of cellular activities. Some activities require a few hundred genes to run largely synchronous transcriptional programs. To achieve this, cells have evolved global regulator (GR) proteins that can influence hundreds of genes simultaneously. We have engineered a library of
                <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
                strains to track the levels over time of these, phenotypically critical, GRs. Each strain has a single-copy plasmid coding for a fast-maturing green fluorescent protein whose transcription is controlled by a copy of the natural GR promoter. By allowing the tracking of GR levels, with sensitivity and specificity, this library should become of wide use in scientific research on bacterial gene expression (from molecular to synthetic biology) and, later, be used in applications in therapeutics and bioindustries.

              <jats:italic>Archaea</jats:italic>
              from metagenomics, new computational methods need to be developed, followed by in-depth analysis. Among them is the genome-wide protein fusion screening performed here. Natural fusions and fissions of genes not only contribute to microbial evolution but also complicate the correct identification and functional annotation of sequences. The products of these processes can be defined as fusion (or composite) proteins, the ones consisting of two or more domains originally encoded by different genes and split proteins, and the ones originating from the separation of a gene in two (fission). Fusion identifications are required for proper phylogenetic reconstructions and metabolic pathway completeness assessments, while mappings between fused and unfused proteins can fill some of the existing gaps in metabolic models. In the archaeal genome-wide screening, more than 1,900 fusion/fission protein clusters were identified, belonging to both newly sequenced and well-studied lineages. These protein families are mainly associated with different types of metabolism, genetic, and cellular processes. Moreover, 162 of the identified fusion/fission protein families are archaeal specific, having no identified fused homolog within the bacterial domain. Our approach was validated by the identification of experimentally characterized fusion/fission cases. However, around 25% of the identified fusion/fission families lack functional annotations for both composite and split states, showing the need for experimental characterization in Archaea.

                on a broad taxonomic scale. The overlay of multiple computational techniques allows the detection of a fine-grained set of predicted fusion/fission families, instead of rough estimations based on conserved domain annotations only. The exhaustive mapping of fused proteins to bacterial organisms allows us to capture fusion/fission families that are specific to archaeal biology, as well as to identify links between bacterial and archaeal lineages based on cooccurrence of taxonomically restricted proteins and their sequence features. Furthermore, the identification of poorly characterized lineage-specific fusion proteins opens up possibilities for future experimental and computational investigations. This approach enhances our understanding of Archaea in general and provides potential candidates for in-depth studies in the future.

These patterns are critical to predictions of soil microbiome responses to climate change and resulting feedbacks that regulate greenhouse gas release from soils. To address this gap, we assay 1,512 manually curated soil metagenomes using complementary annotation databases, read-based taxonomy, and machine learning to extract multidimensional genomic fingerprints of global soil microbiomes. Our objective is to uncover novel biogeographical patterns of soil microbiomes across environmental factors and ecological biomes with high molecular resolution. We reveal shifts in the potential for (i) microbial nutrient acquisition across pH gradients; (ii) stress-, transport-, and redox-based processes across changes in soil bulk density; and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions across biomes. We also use an unsupervised approach to reveal a collection of soils with distinct genomic signatures, characterized by coordinated changes in soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity and in bulk density and clay content that may ultimately reflect soil environments with high microbial activity. Genomic fingerprints for these soils highlight the importance of resource scavenging, plant-microbe interactions, fungi, and heterotrophic metabolisms. Across all analyses, we observed phylogenetic coherence in soil microbiomes—more closely related microorganisms tended to move congruently in response to soil factors. Collectively, the genomic fingerprints uncovered here present a basis for global patterns in the microbial mechanisms underlying soil biogeochemistry and help beget tractable microbial reaction networks for incorporation into process-based models of soil carbon and nutrient cycling.</jats:p>

As microbes have different levels of tolerance to environmental changes and habitat preferences, they can be categorized into habitat generalists and specialists. Here, we explored the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of both prokaryotic and microeukaryotic habitat generalists and specialists from six urban parks across five habitat types, including moss, soil, tree hole, water, and sediment. Our results revealed that different ecological and evolutionary processes maintained and regulated microbial diversity in urban park ecosystems. Under ecological perspective, community assembly of microbial communities was mainly driven by stochastic processes; however, deterministic processes were higher for habitat specialists than generalists. Microbial interactions were highly dynamic among habitats, and habitat specialists played key roles as module hubs in intradomain networks. In aquatic interdomain networks, microeukaryotic habitat specialists and prokaryotic habitat specialists played crucial roles as module hubs and connectors, respectively. Furthermore, analyzing evolutionary characteristics, our results revealed that habitat specialists had a much higher diversification potential than generalists, while generalists showed shorter phylogenetic branch lengths as well as larger genomes than specialists.

              The ability to modify and control natural and engineered microbiomes is essential for biotechnology and biomedicine. Fungi are critical members of most microbiomes, yet technology for modifying the fungal members of a microbiome has lagged far behind that for bacteria. Interdomain conjugation (IDC) is a promising approach, as DNA transfer from bacterial cells to yeast enables
              <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
              modification. While such genetic transfers have been known to naturally occur in a wide range of eukaryotes and are thought to contribute to their evolution, IDC has been understudied as a technique to control fungal or fungal-bacterial consortia. One major obstacle to the widespread use of IDC is its limited efficiency. In this work, we manipulated metabolic and physical interactions between genetically tractable
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>
              to control the incidence of IDC. We test the landscape of population interactions between the bacterial donors and yeast recipients to find that bacterial commensalism leads to maximized IDC, both in culture and in mixed colonies. We demonstrate the capacity of cell-to-cell binding via mannoproteins to assist both IDC incidence and bacterial commensalism in culture and model how these tunable controls can predictably yield a range of IDC outcomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these controls can be utilized to irreversibly alter a recipient yeast population, by both “rescuing” a poor-growing recipient population and collapsing a stable population via a novel IDC-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system.

                Fungi are important but often unaddressed members of most natural and synthetic microbial communities. This work highlights opportunities for modifying yeast microbiome populations through bacterial conjugation. While conjugation has been recognized for its capacity to deliver engineerable DNA to a range of cells, its dependence on cell contact has limited its efficiency. Here, we find “knobs” to control DNA transfer, by engineering the metabolic dependence between bacterial donors and yeast recipients and by changing their ability to physically adhere to each other. Importantly, we functionally validate these “knobs” by irreversibly altering yeast populations. We use these controls to “rescue” a failing yeast population, demonstrate the capacity of conjugated CRISPR/Cas9 to depress or collapse populations, and show that conjugation can be easily interrupted by disrupting cell-to-cell binding. These results offer building blocks toward

            <jats:p>A dysfunction of human host genes and proteins in coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a key factor impacting clinical symptoms and outcomes. Yet, a detailed understanding of human host immune responses is still incomplete. Here, we applied RNA sequencing to 94 samples of COVID-19 patients with and without hematological tumors as well as COVID-19 uninfected non-tumor individuals to obtain a comprehensive transcriptome landscape of both hematological tumor patients and non-tumor individuals. In our analysis, we further accounted for the human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome, human protein interactome, and human protein complex subnetworks to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and host immune responses. Our data sets enabled us to identify important SARS-CoV-2 (non-)targeted differentially expressed genes and complexes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hematological tumor and non-tumor individuals. We found several unique differentially expressed genes, complexes, and functions/pathways such as blood coagulation (APOE, SERPINE1, SERPINE2, and TFPI), lipoprotein particle remodeling (APOC2, APOE, and CETP), and pro-B cell differentiation (IGHM, VPREB1, and IGLL1) during COVID-19 infection in patients with hematological tumors. In particular, APOE, a gene that is associated with both blood coagulation and lipoprotein particle remodeling, is not only upregulated in hematological tumor patients post-SARS-CoV-2 infection but also significantly expressed in acute dead patients with hematological tumors, providing clues for the design of future therapeutic strategies specifically targeting COVID-19 in patients with hematological tumors. Our data provide a rich resource for understanding the specific pathogenesis of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematological malignancies, and developing effective therapeutics for COVID-19.</jats:p>

Our study profiles changes in the transcriptome landscape post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in hematological tumor patients and non-tumor individuals. Furthermore, our integrative and comparative systems biology analysis of the interactome, complexome, and transcriptome provides new insights into the tumor-specific pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our findings confirm that SARS-CoV-2 potentially tends to target more non-functional host proteins to indirectly affect host immune responses in hematological tumor patients. The identified unique genes, complexes, functions/pathways, and expression patterns post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with hematological tumors increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the host molecular mechanism. Our observed differential genes/complexes and clinical indicators of normal/long infection and deceased COVID-19 patients provide clues for understanding the mechanism of COVID-19 progression in hematological tumors. Finally, our study provides an important data resource that supports the increasing value of the application of publicly accessible data sets to public health.</jats:p>

              In low-microbial biomass samples such as bovine milk, contaminants can outnumber endogenous bacteria. Because of this, milk microbiome research suffers from a critical knowledge gap, namely, does non-mastitis bovine milk contain a native microbiome? In this study, we sampled external and internal mammary epithelia and stripped and cisternal milk and used numerous negative controls, including air and sampling controls and extraction and library preparation blanks, to identify the potential sources of contamination. Two algorithms were used to mathematically remove contaminants and track the potential movement of microbes among samples. Results suggest that the majority (i.e., &gt;75%) of sequence data generated from bovine milk and mammary epithelium samples represents contaminating DNA. Contaminants in milk samples were primarily sourced from DNA extraction kits and the internal and external skin of the teat, while teat canal and apex samples were mainly contaminated during the sampling process. After decontamination, the milk microbiome displayed a more dispersed, less diverse, and compositionally distinct bacterial profile compared with epithelial samples. Similar microbial compositions were observed between cisternal and stripped milk samples, as well as between teat apex and canal samples.

              <jats:p>Obtaining a non-contaminated sample of bovine milk is challenging due to the nature of the sampling environment and the route by which milk is typically extracted from the mammary gland. Furthermore, the very low bacterial biomass of bovine milk exacerbates the impacts of contaminant sequences in downstream analyses, which can lead to severe biases. Our finding showed that bovine milk contains very low bacterial biomass and each contamination event (including sampling procedure and DNA extraction process) introduces bacteria and/or DNA fragments that easily outnumber the native bacterial cells. This finding has important implications for our ability to draw robust conclusions from milk microbiome data, especially if the data have not been subjected to rigorous decontamination procedures. Based on these findings, we strongly urge researchers to include numerous negative controls into their sampling and sample processing workflows and to utilize several complementary methods for identifying potential contaminants within the resulting sequence data. These measures will improve the accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, and interpretability of milk microbiome data and research.</jats:p>

              Microbial species that comprise host-associated microbiomes play an essential role in maintaining and mediating the health of plants and animals. While defining the role of individual or even complex communities is important toward quantifying the effect of the microbiome on host health, it is often challenging to develop causal studies that link microbial populations to changes in host fitness. Here, we investigated the impacts of reduced microbial load following antibiotic exposure on the fitness of the anemone,
              <jats:italic>Exaiptasia diaphana</jats:italic>
              and subsequent recovery of the host’s microbiome. Anemones were exposed to two different types of antibiotic solutions for 3 weeks and subsequently held in sterilized seawater for a 3-week recovery period. Our results revealed that both antibiotic treatments reduced the overall microbial load during and up to 1 week post-treatment. The observed reduction in microbial load was coupled with reduced anemone biomass, halted asexual reproduction rates, and for one of the antibiotic treatments, the partial removal of the anemone’s algal symbiont. Finally, our amplicon sequencing results of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that anemone bacterial composition only shifted in treated individuals during the recovery phase of the experiment, where we also observed a significant reduction in the overall diversity of the microbial community. Our work implies that the
              <jats:italic>E. diaphana’s</jats:italic>
              microbiome contributes to host fitness and that the recovery of the host’s microbiome following disturbance with antibiotics leads to a reduced, but stable microbial state.

Here, we applied antibiotics to quantify the impact of microbiome removal on host fitness as well as define trajectories in microbiome recovery following disturbance. We showed that reduction of the microbiome leads to negative impacts on host fitness, and that the microbiome does not recover to its original composition while held under aseptic conditions. Rather the microbiome becomes less diverse, but more consistent across individuals. Our work is important because it suggests that anemone microbiomes play a role in maintaining host fitness, that they are susceptible to disturbance events, and that it is possible to generate gnotobiotic individuals that can be leveraged in microbiome manipulation studies to investigate the role of individual species on host health.

              Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication deficiencies and stereotypic behaviors influenced by hereditary and/or environmental risk factors. There are currently no approved medications for treating the core symptoms of ASD. Human fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a potential intervention to improve autistic symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of human-derived FMT on behavioral and multi-omics profiles of the BTBR mice, an established model for ASD. FMT effectively alleviated the social deficits in the BTBR mice and normalized their distinct plasma metabolic profile, notably reducing the elevated long-chain acylcarnitines.

              Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with active COVID-19 infection often have more severe symptoms and worse recovery. COVID-19 infection can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is also a risk factor for poor outcomes in AIS patients. However, the association between gut microbiota and functional outcomes among AIS patients with COVID-19 infection has not been fully clarified yet. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbial community among AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection, AIS patients with post-acute COVID-19 infection, and AIS patients without COVID-19 infection. We found that AIS patients with acute COVID-19 experienced poorer recovery and significant gut dysbiosis, characterized by higher levels of

However, the specific connection between gut bacteria and the functional outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood yet. In our study, we observed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and shifts in the abundance of key bacterial families in AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we identified that the time window was a critical influence factor for stroke outcomes, and the enrichment of
                <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic>
                acted as a mediator in the relationship between the infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our research provides a new perspective on the complex interplay among AIS, COVID-19 infection, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, recognizing

                as a potential mediator of poor stroke prognosis offers a novel avenue for future exploration and therapeutic interventions.

              The Solar Lake in Taba, Egypt, encompasses one of the few modern-day microbial mats’ systems metabolically analogous to Precambrian stromatolites. Solar Lake benthic communities and their adaptation to the Lake’s unique limnological cycle have not been described for over two decades. In this study, we revisit the flat mat and describe the summer’s shallow water versus exposed microbial community; the latter occurs in response to the seasonal partial receding of water. We employed metagenomic NovaSeq-6000 shotgun sequencing and 16S rRNA,
              <jats:italic>mcrA,</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Candidatus</jats:italic>
              Aenigmatarchaeota, Micrarchaeota, and Omnitrophota MAGs were exclusively detected in the shallow-water mats, whereas

              and
              <jats:italic>Myxococcota</jats:italic>
              MAGs were specific to the exposed microbial mat. Functionally, genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification and osmotic pressure were more abundant in the exposed than in the shallow-water microbial mats, whereas genes involved in sulfate reduction/oxidation and nitrogen fixation were ubiquitously detected. Genes involved in the utilization of methylated amines for methane production were predominant when compared with genes associated with alternative methanogenesis pathways. Solar Lake methanogen MAGs belonged to
              <jats:italic>Methanosarcinia</jats:italic>

              Fifty-five years ago, the extremophilic “Solar Lake” was discovered on the Red Sea shores, garnering microbiologists’ interest worldwide from the 1970s to 1990s. Nevertheless, research on the lake paused at the turn of the millennium. In our study, we revisited the Solar Lake benthic community using a genome-centric approach and described the distinct microbial communities in the exposed versus shallow-water mat unveiling microbial zonation in the benthic communities surrounding the Solar Lake. Our findings highlighted the unique structural and functional adaptations employed by these microbial mat communities. Moreover, we report new methanogens and phototrophs, including an intriguing methanogen from the
              <jats:italic>Archaeoglobales</jats:italic>
              family. We describe how the Solar Lake’s flat mat microbial community adapts to stressors like oxygen intrusion and drought due to summer water level changes, which provides insights into the genomic strategies of microbial communities to cope with altered and extreme environmental conditions.

              The surface of smear-ripened cheeses constitutes a dynamic microbial ecosystem resulting from the successive development of different microbial groups such as lactic acid bacteria, fungi, and ripening bacteria. Recent studies indicate that a viral community, mainly composed of bacteriophages, also represents a common and substantial part of the cheese microbiome. However, the composition of this community, its temporal variations, and associations between bacteriophages and their hosts remain poorly characterized. Here, we studied a French smear-ripened cheese by both viral metagenomics and 16S metabarcoding approaches to assess both the succession of phages and bacterial communities on the cheese surface during cheese ripening and their temporal variations in ready-to-eat cheeses over the years of production. We observed a clear transition of the phage community structure during ripening with a decreased relative abundance of viral species (vOTUs) associated with
              <jats:italic>Lactococcus</jats:italic>
              phages, which were replaced by vOTUs associated with phages infecting ripening bacteria such as
              <jats:italic>Brevibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Pseudoalteromonas,</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Vibrio</jats:italic>
              . The dynamics of the phage community was strongly associated with bacterial successions observed on the cheese surface. Finally, while some variations in the distribution of phages were observed in ready-to-eat cheeses produced at different dates spanning more than 4 years of production, the most abundant phages were detected throughout. This result revealed the long-term persistence of the dominant phages in the cheese production environment. Together, these findings offer novel perspectives on the ecology of bacteriophages in smear-ripened cheese and emphasize the significance of incorporating bacteriophages in the microbial ecology studies of fermented foods.

              <jats:p>The succession of diverse microbial populations is critical for ensuring the production of high-quality cheese. We observed a temporal succession of phages on the surface of a smear-ripened cheese, with new phage communities showing up when ripening bacteria start covering this surface. Interestingly, the final phage community of this cheese is also consistent over large periods of time, as the same bacteriophages were found in cheese products from the same manufacturer made over 4 years. This research highlights the importance of considering these bacteriophages when studying the microbial life of fermented foods like cheese.</jats:p>

              <jats:italic>erm</jats:italic>
              is often induced by the macrolide-mediated ribosome stalling in the upstream co-transcribed leader sequence, thereby triggering a conformational switch of the intergenic RNA hairpins to allow the translational initiation of

              expression and MLS phenotypes. Subsequent experimental validation of 11 randomly selected variants demonstrated an impressive 91% accuracy in predicting MLS phenotypes. Furthermore, we uncovered a mixed distribution of MLS-sensitive and MLS-resistant
              <jats:italic>ermB</jats:italic>
              loci within the evolutionary tree, indicating repeated and independent evolution of MLS resistance. Taken together, this study not only elucidates the evolutionary processes driving the emergence and development of MLS resistance but also highlights the potential of using non-coding genomic allele data to predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes.

              Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a global health threat as the efficacy of available antibiotics has rapidly eroded due to the widespread transmission of AR genes. Using Erm-dependent MLS resistance as a model, this study highlights the significance of non-coding genomic allelic variations. Through a comprehensive analysis of upstream regulatory elements within the
              <jats:italic>erm</jats:italic>
              family, we elucidated the evolutionary emergence and development of AR mechanisms. Leveraging population-wide machine learning (ML)-based genomic analysis, we transformed substantial non-random allelic variations into discernible clusters of elements, enabling precise prediction of MLS phenotypes from non-coding regions. These findings offer deeper insight into AR evolution and demonstrate the potential of harnessing non-coding genomic allele data for accurately predicting AR phenotypes.

              In nature, bacteria often survive in a stationary state with low metabolic activity. Phages use the metabolic machinery of the host cell to replicate, and, therefore, their efficacy against non-dividing cells is usually limited. Nevertheless, it was previously shown that the
              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</jats:italic>
              phage SEP1 has the remarkable capacity to actively replicate in stationary-phase cells, reducing their numbers. Here, we studied for the first time the transcriptomic profiles of both exponential and stationary cells infected with SEP1 phage using RNA-seq to gain a better understanding of this rare phenomenon. We showed that SEP1 successfully takes over the transcriptional apparatus of both exponential and stationary cells. Infection was, however, delayed in stationary cells, with genes within the

              responded to SEP1 infection by upregulating three genes involved in a DNA modification system, with this being observed already 5 min after infection in exponential cells and later in stationary cells. In stationary cells, a significant number of genes involved in translation and RNA metabolic and biosynthetic processes were upregulated after 15 and 30 min of SEP1 infection in comparison with the uninfected control, showing that SEP1 activates metabolic and biosynthetic pathways necessary to its successful replication.

In particular, the gut bacterial diversity and community assembly processes of

              <jats:italic>Bombus pyrosoma</jats:italic>
              across the Chinese landscape and used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine their gut microbiota diversity and biogeography. The gut microbiota composition and community structure of

All or part of environmental factors such as latitude, annual mean temperature, elevation, human footprint, population density, and annual precipitation can affect the alpha diversity and community structure of gut bacteria. Further analysis showed that the assembly and shift of bumblebee gut bacterial communities under geographical variation were mainly driven by the stochastic drift of the neutral process rather than by variable selection of niche differentiation. In conclusion, our unprecedented sampling uncovers bumblebee gut microbiome diversity and shifts over evolutionary time.

              The microbiotas associated with organisms facilitates host health and fitness, and the homeostasis status of gut microbiota also reflects the habitat security faced by the host. In addition, managing gut microbiota is important to improve bumblebee health by understanding the ecological process of the gut microbiome. Thus, we first carried out an runprecedented sampling of 513 workers of the species
              <jats:italic>Bombus pyrosoma</jats:italic>
              across the Chinese landscape and used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to uncover their gut microbiota diversity and biogeography. Our study provides new insights into the understanding of gut microbiome diversity and shifts for Chinese Bumblebee over evolutionary time.

              The alarming rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections is driving efforts to develop alternatives to conventional antibiotics. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising candidates for their ability to target a broad range of microorganisms. However, the development of AMPs with optimal potency, selectivity, and/or stability profiles remains a challenge. To address it, computational tools for predicting AMP properties and designing novel peptides have gained increasing attention. PyAMPA is a novel platform for AMP discovery. It consists of five modules, namely AMPScreen, AMPValidate, AMPSolve, AMPMutate, and AMPOptimize, that allow high-throughput proteome inspection, candidate screening, and optimization through point-mutation and genetic algorithms. The platform also offers additional tools for predicting and evaluating AMP properties, including antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, and peptide half-life. By providing innovative and accessible inroads into AMP motifs in proteomes, PyAMPA will enable advances in AMP development and potential translation into clinically useful molecules. PyAMPA is available at:

              Bacterial chromosomal type I toxin-antitoxin systems consist of a small protein, typically under 60 amino acids, and a small RNA (sRNA) that represses toxin translation. These gene pairs have gained attention over the last decade for their contribution to antibiotic persistence and phage tolerance in bacteria. However, biological functions for many remain elusive as gene deletions often fail to produce an observable phenotype. For many pairs, it is still unknown when the toxin and/or antitoxin gene are natively expressed within the bacterium. We examined sequence conservation of three type I toxin-antitoxin systems,
              <jats:italic>tisB/istR-1, shoB/ohsC,</jats:italic>
              and

              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              strains, including pathogenic and commensal isolates. Using our custom database, we found that these gene pairs are widespread across
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              and have expression potential via BLASTn. We identified an alternative, dominant sequence variant of TisB and confirmed that it is toxic upon overproduction. Additionally, analyses revealed a highly conserved sequence in the
              <jats:italic>zorO</jats:italic>
              mRNA untranslated region that is required for full toxicity. We further noted that over 30% of
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              genomes contain an
              <jats:italic>orz</jats:italic>

                Chromosomal type I toxin-antitoxins are a class of genes that have gained increasing attention over the last decade for their roles in antibiotic persistence which may contribute to therapeutic failures. However, the control of many of these genes and when they function have remained elusive. We demonstrate that a simple genetic conservation-based approach utilizing free, publicly available data yields known and novel insights into the regulation and function of three chromosomal type I toxin-antitoxins in

              <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              . The factors that contribute to the emergence of HMV subpopulations remain unclear. In this study, eight
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              strains were recovered from an inpatient who had been hospitalized for 20 days. Three of the isolates exhibited a non-HMV phenotype, which was concomitant with higher biofilm formation than the other five HMV isolates. All eight isolates were highly susceptible to serum killing, albeit HMV strains were remarkably more infective than non-HMV counterparts in a mouse model of infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the eight isolates belonged to the K57-ST412 lineage. Average nucleotide identity (FastANIb) analysis indicated that eight isolates share 99.96% to 99.99% similarity and were confirmed to be the same clone. Through comparative genomics analysis, 12 non-synonymous mutations were found among these isolates, eight of which in the non-HMV variants, including

HMV was earlier attributed to the overproduction of capsular polysaccharide, and more data point to the possibility of several causes contributing to this bacterial phenotype. Here, we describe a unique event in which the same clonal population showed both HMV and non-HMV characteristics. Studies have demonstrated that this process is influenced by mutational processes and genes related to transport and central metabolism. These findings provide fresh insight into the mechanisms behind co-occurrence of HMV and non-HMV phenotypes in monoclonal populations as well as potentially being critical in developing strategies to control the further spread of HMV

Here, we sought to investigate the influence of changes in environmental physicochemical conditions and viral predation pressure by autochthonous and allochthonous viruses on host dynamics. For this purpose, we transplanted two microbiomes coming from distant hypersaline systems (solar salterns of Es Trenc in Spain and the thalassohaline lake of Aran-Bidgol lake in Iran), by exchanging the cellular fractions with the sterile-filtered accompanying brines with and without the free extracellular virus fraction. The midterm exposure (1 month) of the microbiomes to the new conditions showed that at the supraspecific taxonomic range, the assemblies from the solar saltern brine more strongly resisted the environmental changes and viral predation than that of the lake. The metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) analysis revealed an intraspecific transition at the ecotype level, mainly driven by changes in viral predation pressure, by both autochthonous and allochthonous viruses.</jats:p>

Previous studies have described the microbial community structures and functional potential in the seawater and surface sediment of MT. Still, the metabolic features and adaptation strategies of the microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling processes are poorly understood. In this study, comparative metagenomic approaches were used to study microbial nitrogen cycling in three MT habitats, including hadal seawater [9,600–10,500 m below sea level (mbsl)], surface sediments [0–46 cm below seafloor (cmbsf) at a water depth between 7,143 and 8,638 mbsl], and deep sediments (200–306 cmbsf at a water depth of 8,300 mbsl).

              The skin microbiome plays a pivotal role in human health by providing protective and functional benefits. Furthermore, its inherent stability and individual specificity present novel forensic applications. These aspects have sparked considerable research enthusiasm among scholars across various fields. However, the selection of specific 16S rRNA hypervariable regions for skin microbiome studies is not standardized and should be validated through extensive research tailored to different research objectives and targeted bacterial taxa. Notably, third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology leverages the full discriminatory power of the 16S gene and enables more detailed and accurate microbial community analyses. Here, we conducted full-length 16S sequencing of 141 skin microbiota samples from multiple human anatomical sites using the PacBio platform. Based on this data, we generated derived 16S sub-region data through an
              <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>
              experiment. Comparisons between the 16S full-length and the derived variable region data revealed that the former can provide superior taxonomic resolution. However, even with full 16S gene sequencing, limitations arise in achieving 100% taxonomic resolution at the species level for skin samples. Additionally, the capability to resolve high-abundance bacteria (TOP30) at the genus level remains generally consistent across different 16S variable regions. Furthermore, the V1-V3 region offers a resolution comparable with that of full-length 16S sequences, in comparison to other hypervariable regions studied. In summary, while acknowledging the benefits of full-length 16S gene analysis, we propose the targeting of specific sub-regions as a practical choice for skin microbial research, especially when balancing the accuracy of taxonomic classification with limited sequencing resources, such as the availability of only short-read sequencing or insufficient DNA.

              The development and growth of animals coincide with the establishment and maturation of their microbiotas. To evaluate the respiratory and fecal microbiotas of beef calves from birth to weaning, a total of 30 pregnant cows, and their calves at birth, were enrolled in this study. Deep nasal swabs and feces were collected from calves longitudinally, starting on the day of birth and ending on the day of weaning. Nasopharyngeal, vaginal, and fecal samples were also collected from cows, and the microbiotas of all samples were analyzed. The fecal microbiota of calves was enriched with
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>
              during the first 8 weeks of life, before being displaced by genera associated with fiber digestion, and then increasing in diversity across time. In contrast, the diversity of calf respiratory microbiota generally decreased with age. At birth, the calf and cow nasal microbiotas were highly similar, indicating colonization from dam contact. This was supported by microbial source-tracking analysis. The structure of the calf nasal microbiota remained similar to that of the cows, until weaning, when it diverged. The changes were driven by a decrease in
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>
              and an increase in genera typically associated with bovine respiratory disease, including

              <jats:p>In beef cattle production, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) accounts for most of the feedlot morbidities and mortalities. Metaphylaxis is a common management tool to mitigate BRD, however its use has led to increased antimicrobial resistance. Novel methods to mitigate BRD are needed, including microbiota-based strategies. However, information on the respiratory bacteria of beef calves prior to weaning was limited. In this study, it was shown that the microbiota of cows influenced the initial composition of both respiratory and fecal microbiotas in calves. While colonization of the respiratory tract of calves by BRD-associated genera occurred early in life, their relative abundances increased at weaning, and were negatively correlated with respiratory and gut bacteria. Thus, microbiotas of both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts have important roles in antagonism of respiratory pathogens and are potential targets for enhancing calf respiratory health. Modulation may be most beneficial, if done prior to weaning, before opportunistic pathogens establish colonization.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Are two adjacent genes in the same operon? What are the order and spacing between several transcription factor binding sites? Genome browsers are software data visualization and exploration tools that enable biologists to answer questions such as these. In this paper, we report on a major update to our browser, Genome Explorer, that provides nearly instantaneous scaling and traversing of a genome, enabling users to quickly and easily zoom into an area of interest. The user can rapidly move between scales that depict the entire genome, individual genes, and the sequence; Genome Explorer presents the most relevant detail and context for each scale. By downloading the data for the entire genome to the user’s web browser and dynamically generating visualizations locally, we enable ﬁne control of zoom and pan functions and real-time redrawing of the visualization, resulting in smoother and more intuitive exploration of a genome than is possible with other browsers. Further, genome features are presented together, in-line, using familiar graphical depictions. In contrast, many other browsers depict genome features using data tracks, which have low information density and can visually obscure the relative positions of features. Genome Explorer diagrams have a high information density that provides larger amounts of genome context and sequence information to be presented in a given-sized monitor than for tracks-based browsers. Genome Explorer provides optional data tracks for the analysis of large-scale data sets and a unique comparative mode that aligns genomes at orthologous genes with synchronized zooming.</jats:p>

              Antibiotic resistance and tolerance remain a major problem for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. Identifying genes that influence antibiotic susceptibility could open the door to novel antimicrobial strategies, including targets for new synergistic drug combinations. Here, we developed a genome-wide CRISPR interference library for
              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
              , demonstrated its use by quantifying gene fitness in different strains through CRISPRi-seq, and used it to identify genes that modulate susceptibility to the lipoglycopeptide dalbavancin. By exposing the library to sublethal concentrations of dalbavancin using both CRISPRi-seq and direct selection methods, we not only found genes previously reported to be involved in antibiotic susceptibility but also identified genes thus far unknown to affect antibiotic tolerance. Importantly, some of these genes could not have been detected by more conventional transposon-based knockout approaches because they are essential for growth, stressing the complementary value of CRISPRi-based methods. Notably, knockdown of a gene encoding the uncharacterized protein KapB specifically sensitizes the cells to dalbavancin, but not to other antibiotics of the same class, whereas knockdown of the Shikimate pathway showed the opposite effect. The results presented here demonstrate the promise of CRISPRi-seq screens to identify genes and pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility and pave the way to explore alternative antimicrobial treatments through these insights.

With this method, we identified genes that altered the sensitivity to dalbavancin upon knockdown, including genes involved in different cellular functions. CRISPRi-seq offers a means to uncover untapped antibiotic targets, including those that conventional screens would disregard due to their essentiality. This paves the way for the discovery of new ways to fight infections.

The results can be enriched with Pfam protein domain prediction, Cluster of Orthologs Genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, and Swissprot homologs. The web application allows searching for speciﬁc genes or annotations, running Blast queries, and comparing genomic regions and whole genomes. The metabolic capacities of organisms can be compared at either the module or pathway levels.

              Some lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can provide significant health benefits, which are critically important for the conservation of endangered animals, such as giant pandas. However, little is known about the diversity and culturability of LAB in the giant panda gut microbiota. To understand the roles of LAB in giant panda conservation, it is critical to culture bacterial strains of interest. In this study, we established a pipeline to culture bacterial strains using enrichment of target bacteria with different liquid media and growth conditions. Then, the strains were isolated in solid media to study their functions. Using 210 samples from the culture enrichment method and 138 culture-independent samples, we obtained 1120 amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) belonging to
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillales</jats:italic>
              . Out of the 1120 ASVs, 812 ASVs from the culture enrichment approach were twofold more diverse than 336 ASVs from the culture-independent approach. Many ASVs of interest were not detected in the culture-independent approach. Using this pipeline, we isolated many relevant bacterial strains and established a giant panda gut bacteria strain collection that included strains with low-abundance in culture-independent samples and included most of the giant panda LAB described by other researchers. The strain collection consisted of 60 strains representing 35 species of 12 genera. Thus, our pipeline is powerful and provides guidance in culturing gut microbiota of interest in hosts such as the giant panda.

In this study, we developed a pipeline with low-cost and user-friendly culture enrichment to reveal the diversity of LAB in giant pandas. We compared the difference between culture-independent and culture enrichment methods, screened strains of interest that produced high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we investigated the catalog of virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, butyrate and lactate synthesis genes of the strains at a genomic level.

              Skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) is currently the main disease threatening
              <jats:italic>Apostichopus japonicus</jats:italic>
              aquaculture due to its higher mortality rate and infectivity, which is caused by
              <jats:italic>Vibrio splendidus</jats:italic>
              . Our previous studies have demonstrated that SUS is accompanied by intestinal microbiota (IM) dysbiosis, alteration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content and the damage to the intestinal barrier. However, the mediating effect of IM on intestine dysfunction is largely unknown. Herein, we conducted comprehensive intestinal microbiota transplantation (IMT) to explore the link between IM and SUS development. Furthermore, we isolated and identified a
              <jats:italic>Bacillus coagulans</jats:italic>
              strain with an ability to produce acetic acid from both healthy individual and SUS individual with IM from healthy donors. We found that dysbiotic IM and intestinal barrier function in SUS recipients
              <jats:italic>A. japonicus</jats:italic>
              could be restored by IM from healthy donors. The
              <jats:italic>B. coagulans</jats:italic>
              strain could restore IM community and intestinal barrier function. Consistently, acetate supply also restores intestinal homeostasis of SUS-diseased and

              -infected
              <jats:italic>A. japonicus</jats:italic>
              . Mechanically, acetate was found to specifically bind to its receptor-free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) to mediate IM structure community and intestinal barrier function. Knockdown of FFAR2 by transfection of specific FFAR2 siRNA could hamper acetate-mediated intestinal homeostasis
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              . Furthermore, we confirmed that acetate/FFAR2 could inhibit

              restores pathogen-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction via acetate/FFAR2–NF-κB–MLCK–MLC axis, which provides new insights into the control and prevention of SUS outbreak from an ecological perspective.

                <jats:italic>A. japonicus</jats:italic>
                aquaculture industry. Intestinal microbiota (IM) has been studied extensively due to its immunomodulatory properties. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as an essential signal molecule for microbial regulation of host health also have attracted wide attention. Therefore, it is beneficial to explore the link between IM and SUS for prevention and control of SUS. In the study, the contribution of IM to SUS development has been examined. Additionally, our research further validated the restoration of SCFAs on intestinal barrier dysfunction caused by SUS via isolating SCFAs-producing bacteria. Notably, this restoration might be achieved by inhibition of NF-κB–MLCK–MLC signal pathway, which could be activated by
                <jats:italic>V. splendidus</jats:italic>
                . These findings may have important implications for exploration of the role of IM in SUS occurrence and provide insight into the SUS treatment.

              Winter is a relatively under-studied season in freshwater ecology. The paucity of wintertime surveys has led to a lack of knowledge regarding microbial community activity during the winter in Lake Erie, a North American Great Lake. Viruses shape microbial communities and regulate biogeochemical cycles by acting as top-down controls, yet very few efforts have been made to examine active virus populations during the winter in Lake Erie. Furthermore, climate change-driven declines in seasonal ice cover have been shown to influence microbial community structure, but no studies have compared viral community activity between different ice cover conditions. We surveyed surface water metatranscriptomes for viral hallmark genes as a proxy for active virus populations and compared activity metrics between ice-covered and ice-free conditions from two sampled winters. Transcriptionally active viral communities were detected in both winters, spanning diverse phylogenetic clades of putative bacteriophage (
              <jats:italic>Caudoviricetes</jats:italic>
              ), giant viruses (
              <jats:italic>Nucleocytoviricota</jats:italic>
              , or NCLDV), and RNA viruses (
              <jats:italic>Orthornavirae</jats:italic>
              ). However, viral community activity metrics revealed pronounced differences between the ice-covered and ice-free winters. Viral community composition was distinct between winters and viral hallmark gene richness was reduced in the ice-covered relative to the ice-free conditions. In addition, the observed differences in viral communities correlated with microbial community activity metrics. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the viral populations that are active during the winter in Lake Erie and suggest that viral community activity may be associated with ice cover extent.

              <jats:p>As seasonal ice cover is projected to become increasingly rare on large temperate lakes, there is a need to understand how microbial communities might respond to changing ice conditions. Although it is widely recognized that viruses impact microbial community structure and function, there is little known regarding wintertime viral activity or the relationship between viral activity and ice cover extent. Our metatranscriptomic analyses indicated that viruses were transcriptionally active in the winter surface waters of Lake Erie. These findings also expanded the known diversity of viral lineages in the Great Lakes. Notably, viral community activity metrics were significantly different between the two sampled winters. The pronounced differences we observed in active viral communities between the ice-covered and ice-free samples merit further research regarding how viral communities will function in future, potentially ice-free, freshwater systems.</jats:p>

              Non-heritable, phenotypic drug resistance toward antibiotics challenges antibiotic therapies. Characteristics of such phenotypic resistance have implications for the evolution of heritable resistance. Diverse forms of phenotypic resistance have been described, but phenotypic resistance characteristics remain less explored than genetic resistance. Here, we add novel combinations of single-cell characteristics of phenotypic resistant
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              cells and compare those to characteristics of susceptible cells of the parental population by exposure to different levels of recurrent ampicillin antibiotic. Contrasting expectations, we did not find commonly described characteristics of phenotypic resistant cells that arrest growth or near growth. We find that under ampicillin exposure, phenotypic resistant cells reduced their growth rate by about 50% compared to growth rates prior to antibiotic exposure. The growth reduction is a delayed alteration to antibiotic exposure, suggesting an induced response and not a stochastic switch or caused by a predetermined state as frequently described. Phenotypic resistant cells exhibiting constant slowed growth survived best under ampicillin exposure and, contrary to expectations, not only fast-growing cells suffered high mortality triggered by ampicillin but also growth-arrested cells. Our findings support diverse modes of phenotypic resistance, and we revealed resistant cell characteristics that have been associated with enhanced genetically fixed resistance evolution, which supports claims of an underappreciated role of phenotypic resistant cells toward genetic resistance evolution. A better understanding of phenotypic resistance will benefit combatting genetic resistance by developing and engulfing effective anti-phenotypic resistance strategies.

            <jats:p>Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge for modern medicine. Aside from genetic resistance to antibiotics, phenotypic resistance that is not heritable might play a crucial role for the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Using a highly controlled microfluidic system, we characterize single cells under recurrent exposure to antibiotics. Fluctuating antibiotic exposure is likely experienced under common antibiotic therapies. These phenotypic resistant cell characteristics differ from previously described phenotypic resistance, highlighting the diversity of modes of resistance. The phenotypic characteristics of resistant cells we identify also imply that such cells might provide a stepping stone toward genetic resistance, thereby causing treatment failure.</jats:p>

              Fast growth phenotypes are achieved through optimal transcriptomic allocation, in which cells must balance tradeoffs in resource allocation between diverse functions. One such balance between stress readiness and unbridled growth in
              <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
              has been termed the fear versus greed (f/g) tradeoff. Two specific RNA polymerase (RNAP) mutations observed in adaptation to fast growth have been previously shown to affect the f/g tradeoff, suggesting that genetic adaptations may be primed to control f/g resource allocation. Here, we conduct a greatly expanded study of the genetic control of the f/g tradeoff across diverse conditions. We introduced 12 RNA polymerase (RNAP) mutations commonly acquired during adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) and obtained expression profiles of each. We found that these single RNAP mutation strains resulted in large shifts in the f/g tradeoff primarily in the RpoS regulon and ribosomal genes, likely through modifying RNAP-DNA interactions. Two of these mutations additionally caused condition-specific transcriptional adaptations. While this tradeoff was previously characterized by the RpoS regulon and ribosomal expression, we find that the GAD regulon plays an important role in stress readiness and ppGpp in translation activity, expanding the scope of the tradeoff. A phylogenetic analysis found the greed-related genes of the tradeoff present in numerous bacterial species. The results suggest that the f/g tradeoff represents a general principle of transcriptome allocation in bacteria where small genetic changes can result in large phenotypic adaptations to growth conditions.

                must raise ribosomal content at the expense of non-growth functions. Previous studies have linked RNAP mutations to this transcriptional shift and increased growth but were focused on only two mutations found in the protein’s central region. RNAP mutations, however, commonly occur over a large structural range. To explore RNAP mutations’ impact, we have introduced 12 RNAP mutations found in laboratory evolution experiments and obtained expression profiles of each. The mutations nearly universally increased growth rates by adjusting said tradeoff away from non-growth functions. In addition to this shift, a few caused condition-specific adaptations. We explored the prevalence of this tradeoff across phylogeny and found it to be a widespread and conserved trend among bacteria.

              The communication between plants and their microbiota is highly dynamic and involves a complex network of signal molecules. Among them, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a critical phytohormone that not only regulates plant growth and development, but is emerging as an important inter- and intra-kingdom signal that modulates many bacterial processes that are important during interaction with their plant hosts. However, the corresponding signaling cascades remain largely unknown. Here, we advance our understanding of the largely unknown mechanisms by which IAA carries out its regulatory functions in plant-associated bacteria. We showed that IAA caused important changes in the global transcriptome of the rhizobacterium
              <jats:italic>Serratia plymuthica</jats:italic>
              and multidisciplinary approaches revealed that IAA sensing interferes with the signaling mediated by other pivotal plant-derived signals such as amino acids and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Exposure to IAA caused large alterations in the transcript levels of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, resulting in significant metabolic alterations. IAA treatment also increased resistance to toxic aromatic compounds through the induction of the AaeXAB pump, which also confers resistance to IAA. Furthermore, IAA promoted motility and severely inhibited biofilm formation; phenotypes that were associated with decreased c-di-GMP levels and capsule production. IAA increased capsule gene expression and enhanced bacterial sensitivity to a capsule-dependent phage. Additionally, IAA induced the expression of several genes involved in antibiotic resistance and led to changes in the susceptibility and responses to antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. Collectively, our study illustrates the complexity of IAA-mediated signaling in plant-associated bacteria.

            <jats:p>Signal sensing plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to ecological niches and hosts. This communication appears to be particularly important in plant-associated bacteria since they possess a large number of signal transduction systems that respond to a wide diversity of chemical, physical, and biological stimuli. IAA is emerging as a key inter- and intra-kingdom signal molecule that regulates a variety of bacterial processes. However, despite the extensive knowledge of the IAA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in plants, IAA signaling in bacteria remains largely unknown. Here, we provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms by which IAA regulates primary and secondary metabolism, biofilm formation, motility, antibiotic susceptibility, and phage sensitivity in a biocontrol rhizobacterium. This work has important implications for our understanding of bacterial ecology in plant environments and for the biotechnological and clinical applications of IAA, as well as related molecules.</jats:p>

              The gastric microbial community plays a fundamental role in gastric cancer (GC), and the two main anatomical subtypes of GC, non-cardia and cardia GC, are associated with different risk factors (
              <jats:italic>Helicobacter pylori</jats:italic>
              for non-cardia GC). To decipher the different microbial spatial communities of GC, we performed a multicenter retrospective analysis to characterize the gastric microbiota in 223 GC patients, including
              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              -positive or -negative patients, with tumors and paired adjacent normal tissues, using third-generation sequencing. In the independent validation cohort, both dental plaque and GC tumoral tissue samples were collected and sequenced. The prevalence of
              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              and oral-associated bacteria was verified using fluorescence
              <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
              hybridization (FISH) assays in GC tumoral tissues and matched nontumoral tissues. We found that the vertical distribution of the gastric microbiota, at the upper, middle, and lower third sites of GC, was likely an important factor causing microbial diversity in GC tumor tissues. The oral-associated microbiota cluster, which included
              <jats:italic>Veillonella parvula</jats:italic>
              ,
              <jats:italic>Streptococcus oralis</jats:italic>
              , and
              <jats:italic>Prevotella intermedia</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              was more abundant in the lower third of the GC and exhibited a significantly high degree of microbial correlation. The oral-associated microbiota module was co-exclusive with
              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              in the lower third site of the GC tumoral tissue. Importantly,
              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              -negative GC patients with oral-associated gastric microbiota showed worse overall survival, while the increase in microbial abundance in
              <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>
              -positive GC patients showed no difference in overall survival. The prevalence of
              <jats:italic>V. parvula</jats:italic>
              in both the dental plaque and GC tissue samples was concordant in the independent validation phase. We showed that the oral-associated species

            <jats:p>The occurrence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) is related to their physical and chemical environment. However, less is known about their associated microbial interactions and processes. In this study, cyanoHABs were analyzed as a microbial ecosystem, using 1 year of 16S rRNA sequencing and 70 metagenomes collected during the bloom season from Lake Okeechobee (Florida, USA). Biogeographical patterns observed in microbial community composition and function reflected ecological zones distinct in their physical and chemical parameters that resulted in bloom “hotspots” near major lake inflows. Changes in relative abundances of taxa within multiple phyla followed increasing bloom severity. Functional pathways that correlated with increasing bloom severity encoded organic nitrogen and phosphorus utilization, storage of nutrients, exchange of genetic material, phage defense, and protection against oxidative stress, suggesting that microbial interactions may promote cyanoHAB resilience. Cyanobacterial communities were highly diverse, with picocyanobacteria ubiquitous and oftentimes most abundant, especially in the absence of blooms. The identification of novel bloom-forming cyanobacteria and genomic comparisons indicated a functionally diverse cyanobacterial community with differences in its capability to store nitrogen using cyanophycin and to defend against phage using CRISPR and restriction-modification systems. Considering blooms in the context of a microbial ecosystem and their interactions in nature, physiologies and interactions supporting the proliferation and stability of cyanoHABs are proposed, including a role for phage infection of picocyanobacteria. This study displayed the power of “-omics” to reveal important biological processes that could support the effective management and prediction of cyanoHABs.</jats:p>

Although physical and chemical conditions in aquatic systems that facilitate bloom development are well studied, there are fundamental gaps in the biological understanding of the microbial ecosystem that makes a cyanobacterial bloom. High-throughput sequencing was used to determine the drivers of cyanobacteria blooms in nature. Multiple functions and interactions important to consider in cyanobacterial bloom ecology were identified. The microbial biodiversity of blooms revealed microbial functions, genomic characteristics, and interactions between cyanobacterial populations that could be involved in bloom stability and more coherently define cyanobacteria blooms.

              Beneficial interactions between plants and rhizosphere fungi can enhance plant adaptability during drought stress. However, harnessing these interactions will require an in-depth understanding of the response of fungal community assembly to drought. Herein, by using different varieties of wheat plants, we analyzed the drought-induced changes in fungal community assembly in rhizosphere and bulk soil. We demonstrated that drought significantly altered the fungal communities, with the contribution of species richness to community beta diversity increased in both rhizosphere and bulk soil compartments during drought stress. The stochastic processes dominated fungal community assembly, but the relative importance of deterministic processes, mainly homogeneous selection, increased in the drought-stressed rhizosphere. Drought induced an increase in the relative abundance of generalists in the rhizosphere, as opposed to specialists, and the top 10 abundant taxa that enriched under drought conditions were predominantly generalists. Notably, the most abundant drought-enriched taxon in rhizosphere was a generalist, and the corresponding
              <jats:italic>Chaetomium</jats:italic>
              strain was found capable of improving root length and activating ABA signaling in wheat plants through culture-based experiment. Together, these findings provide evidence that host plants exert a strong influence on rhizospheric fungal community assembly during stress and suggest the fungal communities that have experienced drought have the potential to confer fitness advantages to the host plants.

              Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) enables the capture and full-length sequencing of native RNAs, without recoding or amplification bias. Resulting data sets may be interrogated to define the identity and location of chemically modified ribonucleotides, as well as the length of poly(A) tails, on individual RNA molecules. The success of these analyses is highly dependent on the provision of high-resolution transcriptome annotations in combination with workflows that minimize misalignments and other analysis artifacts. Existing software solutions for generating high-resolution transcriptome annotations are poorly suited to small gene-dense genomes of viruses due to the challenge of identifying distinct transcript isoforms where alternative splicing and overlapping RNAs are prevalent. To resolve this, we identified key characteristics of DRS data sets that inform resulting read alignments and developed the nanopore guided annotation of transcriptome architectures (NAGATA) software package (

              ). We demonstrate, using a combination of synthetic and original DRS data sets derived from adenoviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses, and human cells, that NAGATA outperforms existing transcriptome annotation software and yields a consistently high level of precision and recall when reconstructing both gene sparse and gene-dense transcriptomes. Finally, we apply NAGATA to generate the first high-resolution transcriptome annotation of the neglected pathogen human adenovirus type F41 (HAdV-41) for which we identify 77 distinct transcripts encoding at least 23 different proteins.

              Airway microbiota are known to contribute to lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), but their contributions to pathogenesis are still unclear. To improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions, we have developed an integrated analytical and bioinformatic mass spectrometry (MS)-based metaproteomics workflow to analyze clinical bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from people with airway disease. Proteins from BAL cellular pellets were processed and pooled together in groups categorized by disease status (CF vs. non-CF) and bacterial diversity, based on previously performed small subunit rRNA sequencing data. Proteins from each pooled sample group were digested and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS spectra were matched to human and bacterial peptide sequences leveraging a bioinformatic workflow using a metagenomics-guided protein sequence database and rigorous evaluation. Label-free quantification revealed differentially abundant human peptides from proteins with known roles in CF, like neutrophil elastase and collagenase, and proteins with lesser-known roles in CF, including apolipoproteins. Differentially abundant bacterial peptides were identified from known CF pathogens (e.g.,
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>
              ), as well as other taxa with potentially novel roles in CF. We used this host-microbe peptide panel for targeted parallel-reaction monitoring validation, demonstrating for the first time an MS-based assay effective for quantifying host-microbe protein dynamics within BAL cells from individual CF patients. Our integrated bioinformatic and analytical workflow combining discovery, verification, and validation should prove useful for diverse studies to characterize microbial contributors in airway diseases. Furthermore, we describe a promising preliminary panel of differentially abundant microbe and host peptide sequences for further study as potential markers of host-microbe relationships in CF disease pathogenesis.

Our method uses both state-of-the art mass spectrometry-based instrumentation to detect proteins present in these samples and customized bioinformatic software tools to analyze the data and characterize detected proteins and their association with CF. We demonstrate the use of this method to characterize microbe and host proteins from individual BAL samples, paving the way for a new approach to understand molecular contributors to CF and other diseases of the airway.</jats:p>

              Cholestasis is a common morbid state that may occur in different phases; however, a comprehensive evaluation of the long-term effect post-recovery is still lacking. In the hepatic cholestasis mouse model, which was induced by a temporary complete blockage of the bile duct, the stasis of bile acids and liver damage typically recovered within a short period. However, we found that the temporary hepatic cholestasis had a long-term effect on gut microbiota dysbiosis, including overgrowth of small intestinal bacteria, decreased diversity of the gut microbiota, and an overall imbalance in its composition accompanied by an elevated inflammation level. Additionally, we observed an increase in
              <jats:italic>Escherichia-Shigella</jats:italic>
              (represented by ASV136078), rich in virulence factors, in both small and large intestines following cholestasis. To confirm the causal role of dysregulated gut microbiota in promoting hepatic inflammation and injury, we conducted gut microbiota transplantation into germ-free mice. We found that recipient mice transplanted with feces from cholestasis mice exhibited liver inflammation, damage, and accumulation of hepatic bile acids. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that cholestasis disrupts the overall load and structural composition of the gut microbiota in mice, and these adverse effects persist after recovery from cholestatic liver injury. This finding suggests the importance of monitoring the structural composition of the gut microbiota in patients with cholestasis and during their recovery.

We believe that our study contributes to novel and better understanding of the intricate interplay among bile acid homeostasis, gut microbiota, and cholestasis-associated complications.

            <jats:p>The application of fecal metaproteomics to large-scale studies of the gut microbiota requires high-throughput analysis and standardized experimental protocols. Although high-throughput protein cleanup and digestion methods are increasingly used in shotgun proteomics, no studies have yet critically compared such protocols using human fecal samples. In this study, human fecal protein extracts were processed using several different protocols based on three main approaches: filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), and suspension trapping (S-Trap). These protocols were applied in both low-throughput (i.e., microtube-based) and high-throughput (i.e., microplate-based) formats, and the final peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The FASP-based methods and the combination of SP3 with in-StageTips (iST) yielded the best results in terms of the number of peptides identified through a database search against gut microbiome and human sequences. The efficiency of protein digestion, the ability to preserve hydrophobic peptides and high molecular weight proteins, and the reproducibility of the methods were also evaluated for the different protocols. Other relevant variables, including interindividual variability of stool, duration of protocols, and total costs, were considered and discussed. In conclusion, the data presented here can significantly contribute to the optimization and standardization of sample preparation protocols in human fecal metaproteomics. Furthermore, the promising results obtained with the high-throughput methods are expected to encourage the development of automated workflows and their application to large-scale gut microbiome studies.</jats:p>

              Platinum-based chemotherapy failure represents a significant challenge in the management of ovarian cancer (OC) and contributes to disease recurrence and poor prognosis. Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of the gut microbiota in modulating anticancer treatments. However, the precise underlying mechanisms, by which gut microbiota regulates the response to platinum-based therapy, remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of gut microbiota on the anticancer response of cisplatin and its underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrate a substantial improvement in the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin following antibiotic-induced perturbation of the gut microbiota in OC-bearing mice. 16S rRNA sequencing showed a pronounced alteration in the composition of the gut microbiome in the cecum contents following exposure to cisplatin. Through metabolomic analysis, we identified distinct metabolic profiles in the antibiotic-treated group, with a notable enrichment of the gut-derived metabolite 3-methylxanthine in antibiotic-treated mice. Next, we employed a strategy combining transcriptome analysis and chemical–protein interaction network databases. We identified metabolites that shared structural similarity with 3-methylxanthine, which interacted with genes enriched in cancer-related pathways. It is identified that 3-methylxanthinesignificantly enhances the effectiveness of cisplatin by promoting apoptosis both

Importantly, through integrative multiomics analyses, we elucidated the mechanistic basis of this enhanced apoptosis, revealing a dopamine receptor D1-dependent pathway mediated by 3-methylxanthine. This study elucidated the mechanism by which gut-derived metabolite 3-methylxanthine mediated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Our findings highlight the potential translational significance of 3-methylxanthine as a promising adjuvant in conjunction with cisplatin, aiming to improve treatment outcomes for OC patients.

              <jats:p>The precise correlation between the gut microbiota and the anticancer effect of cisplatin in OC remains inadequately understood. Our investigation has revealed that manipulation of the gut microbiota via the administration of antibiotics amplifies the efficacy of cisplatin through the facilitation of apoptosis in OC-bearing mice. Metabolomic analysis has demonstrated that the cecum content from antibiotic-treated mice exhibits an increase in the levels of 3-methylxanthine, which has been shown to potentially enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of cisplatin by an integrated multiomic analysis. This enhancement appears to be attributable to the promotion of cisplatin-induced apoptosis, with 3-methylxanthine potentially exerting its influence via the dopamine receptor D1-dependent pathway. These findings significantly contribute to our comprehension of the impact of the gut microbiota on the anticancer therapy in OC. Notably, the involvement of 3-methylxanthine suggests its prospective utility as a supplementary component for augmenting treatment outcomes in patients afflicted with ovarian cancer.</jats:p>

Improvements in sequencing technology provide additional pairwise information on genome sequences, which may provide valuable information on genomic relationships. Mapping orthologous gene locations between genome pairs, known as synteny, is typically implemented in the discovery of new species and has not been systematically applied to bacterial genomes. Using a data set of 378 bacterial genomes, we developed and tested a new measure of synteny similarity between a pair of genomes, which was scaled onto 16S rRNA distance using covariance matrices. Based on the input gene functions used (i.e., core, antibiotic resistance, and virulence), we observed varying topological arrangements of bacterial relationship networks by applying (i) complete linkage hierarchical clustering and (ii) K-nearest neighbor graph structures to synteny-scaled 16S data. Our metric improved clustering quality comparatively to state-of-the-art average nucleotide identity metrics while preserving clustering assignments for the highest similarity relationships. Our findings indicate that syntenic relationships provide more granular and interpretable relationships for within-genera taxa compared to pairwise similarity measures, particularly in functional contexts.</jats:p>

              We use metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to understand single-carbon (C1) compound-cycling—particularly methane-cycling—microorganisms in montane riparian floodplain sediments. We generated 1,233 MAGs (&gt;50% completeness and &lt;10% contamination) from 50- to 150-cm depth below the sediment surface capturing the transition between oxic, unsaturated sediments and anoxic, saturated sediments in the Slate River (SR) floodplain (Crested Butte, CO, USA). We recovered genomes of putative methanogens, methanotrophs, and methylotrophs (

                The cycling of carbon by microorganisms in subsurface environments is of particular relevance in the face of global climate change. Riparian floodplain sediments contain high organic carbon that can be degraded into C1 compounds such as methane, methanol, and methylamines, the fate of which depends on the microbial metabolisms present as well as the hydrological conditions and availability of oxygen. In the present study, we generated over 1,000 MAGs from subsurface sediments from a montane river floodplain and recovered genomes for microorganisms that are capable of producing and consuming methane and other C1 compounds, highlighting a robust potential for C1 cycling in subsurface sediments both with and without oxygen.

              <jats:italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</jats:italic>
              serovar L2 (CTL) shifts from its normal growth to a non-replicating form, termed persistence. It is unclear if persistence reflects an adaptive response or a lack thereof. To understand this, transcriptomics data were collected for CTL grown under nutrient-replete and nutrient-starved conditions. Applying K-means clustering on transcriptomics data revealed a global transcriptomic rewiring of CTL under stress conditions in the absence of any canonical global stress regulator. This is consistent with previous data that suggested that CTL’s stress response is due to a lack of an adaptive response mechanism. To investigate the impact of this on CTL metabolism, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of CTL (iCTL278) and contextualized it with the collected transcriptomics data. Using the metabolic bottleneck analysis on contextualized iCTL278, we observed that phosphoglycerate mutase (
              <jats:italic>pgm</jats:italic>
              ) regulates the entry of CTL to the persistence state. Our data indicate that

              in the presence or absence of tryptophan revealed the importance of this gene in modulating persistence. Hence, this work, for the first time, introduces thermodynamics and enzyme cost as tools to gain a deeper understanding on CTL persistence.

              <jats:italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</jats:italic>
              serovar L2 (CTL) under tryptophan and iron starvation conditions. As CTL lacks many canonical transcriptional regulators, the model was used to assess two prevailing hypotheses on persistence—that the chlamydial response to nutrient starvation represents a passive response due to the lack of regulators or that it is an active response by the bacterium. K-means clustering of stress-induced transcriptomics data revealed striking evidence in favor of the lack of adaptive (i.e., a passive) response. To find the metabolic signature of this, metabolic modeling pin-pointed pgm as a potential regulator of persistence. Thermodynamic driving force, enzyme cost, and CRISPRi knockdown of pgm supported this finding. Overall, this work introduces thermodynamic driving force and enzyme cost as a tool to understand chlamydial persistence, demonstrating how systems biology-guided CRISPRi can unravel complex bacterial phenomena.

              <jats:italic>Arcobacteraceae</jats:italic>
              is divided into three large clades, among which members of clades A and B are almost all from terrestrial environments, while those of clade C are widely distributed in various marine habitats in addition to some terrestrial origins. All clades harbor genes putatively involved in chitin degradation, sulfide oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, thiosulfate oxidation, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, microaerophilic respiration, and metal (iron/manganese) reduction. Additionally, in clade C, more unique pathways were retrieved, including thiosulfate disproportionation, ethanol fermentation, methane oxidation, fatty acid oxidation, cobalamin synthesis, and dissimilatory reductions of sulfate, perchlorate, and arsenate. Within this clade, two mixotrophic Candidatus genera represented by UBA6211 and CAIJNA01 harbor genes putatively involved in the reverse tricarboxylic acid pathway for carbon fixation. Moreover, the metatranscriptomic data in deep-sea
              <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
              incubations indicated that the latter genus is a mixotroph that conducts carbon fixation by coupling sulfur oxidation and denitrification and metabolizing organic matter. Furthermore, global metatranscriptomic data confirmed the ubiquitous distribution and global relevance of

              The metabolic intimacy of symbiosis often demands the work of specialists. Natural products and defensive secondary metabolites can drive specificity by ensuring infection and propagation across host generations. But in contrast to bacteria, little is known about the diversity and distribution of natural product biosynthetic pathways among fungi and how they evolve to facilitate symbiosis and adaptation to their host environment. In this study, we define the secondary metabolism of
              <jats:italic>Escovopsis</jats:italic>
              and closely related genera, symbionts in the gardens of fungus-farming ants. We ask how the gain and loss of various biosynthetic pathways correspond to divergent lifestyles. Long-read sequencing allowed us to define the chromosomal features of representative
              <jats:italic>Escovopsis</jats:italic>
              strains, revealing highly reduced genomes composed of seven to eight chromosomes. The genomes are highly syntenic with macrosynteny decreasing with increasing phylogenetic distance, while maintaining a high degree of mesosynteny. An ancestral state reconstruction analysis of biosynthetic pathways revealed that, while many secondary metabolites are shared with non-ant-associated
              <jats:italic>Sordariomycetes</jats:italic>
              , 56 pathways are unique to the symbiotic genera. Reflecting adaptation to diverging ant agricultural systems, we observe that the stepwise acquisition of these pathways mirrors the ecological radiations of attine ants and the dynamic recruitment and replacement of their fungal cultivars. As different clades encode characteristic combinations of biosynthetic gene clusters, these delineating profiles provide important insights into the possible mechanisms underlying specificity between these symbionts and their fungal hosts. Collectively, our findings shed light on the evolutionary dynamic nature of secondary metabolism in

                species, as well as species from other symbiont genera, many of which are common with the gardens of fungus-growing ants, are defined by seven chromosomes. Despite a high degree of metabolic conservation, we observe some variation in the symbionts’ potential to produce secondary metabolites. As the phylogenetic distribution of the encoding biosynthetic gene clusters coincides with attine transitions in agricultural systems, we highlight the likely role of these metabolites in mediating adaptation by a group of highly specialized symbionts.

              Interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), plants, and the soil microbial community have the potential to increase the availability and uptake of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in agricultural systems. Nutrient exchange between plant roots, AMF, and the adjacent soil microbes occurs at the interface between roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi and soil, referred to as the mycorrhizosphere. Research on the P exchange focuses on plant–AMF or AMF–microbe interactions, lacking a holistic view of P exchange between the plants, AMF, and other microbes. Recently, N exchange at both interfaces revealed the synergistic role of AMF and bacterial community in N uptake by the host plant. Here, we highlight work carried out on each interface and build upon it by emphasizing research involving all members of the tripartite network. Both nutrient systems are challenging to study due to the complex chemical and biological nature of the mycorrhizosphere. We discuss some of the effective methods to identify important nutrient processes and the tripartite members involved in these processes. The extrapolation of

              Illumina whole-genome shotgun sequences and 1,263 complete genomes to produce 7,954 representative substrains. Pairwise comparison of average nucleotide identity revealed a natural boundary of 99.5% that could be used to define 145 distinct strains within the species. We found that intermediate frequency genes in the pangenome (present in 10%–95% of genomes) could be divided into those closely linked to strain background (“strain-concentrated”) and those highly variable within strains (“strain-diffuse”). Non-core genes had different patterns of chromosome location. Notably, strain-diffuse genes were associated with prophages; strain-concentrated genes were associated with the vSaβ genome island and rare genes (&lt;10% frequency) concentrated near the origin of replication. Antibiotic resistance genes were enriched in the strain-diffuse class, while virulence genes were distributed between strain-diffuse, strain-concentrated, core, and rare classes.

              The gut microbiota is diverse across various taxonomic levels. At the intra-species level, it comprises multiple strains, some of which may be host-specific. However, our understanding of fine-grained diversity has been hindered by the use of the conserved 16S rRNA gene. While shotgun metagenomics offers higher resolution, it remains costly, may fail to identify specific microbes in complex samples, and requires extensive computational resources and expertise. To address this, we employed a simple and cost-effective analysis of alternative genetic markers to explore diversity within
              <jats:italic>Clostridia</jats:italic>
              , a crucial group within the human gut microbiota whose diversity may be underestimated. We found high intra-species diversity for certain groups and associations with obesity. Notably, we identified

              Recent studies have revealed diverse RNA viral communities in soils. Yet, how environmental factors influence soil RNA viruses remains largely unknown. Here, we recovered RNA viral communities from bulk metatranscriptomes sequenced from grassland soils managed for 5 years under multiple environmental conditions including water content, plant presence, cultivar type, and soil depth. More than half of the unique RNA viral contigs (64.6%) were assigned with putative hosts. About 74.7% of these classified RNA viral contigs are known as eukaryotic RNA viruses suggesting eukaryotic RNA viruses may outnumber prokaryotic RNA viruses by nearly three times in this grassland. Of the identified eukaryotic RNA viruses and the associated eukaryotic species, the most dominant taxa were
              <jats:italic>Mitoviridae</jats:italic>
              with an average relative abundance of 72.4%, and their natural hosts, Fungi with an average relative abundance of 56.6%. Network analysis and structural equation modeling support that soil water content, plant presence, and type of cultivar individually demonstrate a significant positive impact on eukaryotic RNA viral richness directly as well as indirectly on eukaryotic RNA viral abundance via influencing the co-existing eukaryotic members. A significant negative influence of soil depth on soil eukaryotic richness and abundance indirectly impacts soil eukaryotic RNA viral communities. These results provide new insights into the collective influence of multiple environmental and community factors that shape soil RNA viral communities and offer a structured perspective of how RNA virus diversity and ecology respond to environmental changes.

              The gut microbiota is essential for providing colonization resistance against pathogens. Dietary sugars markedly shift the composition of the intestinal microbiota and alter host susceptibility to enteric infections. Here, we demonstrate the effect of L-arabinose on bacterial infection by using a mouse infection model with
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>

              <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic>
              , thereby decreasing the microbiota diversity and causing more severe systemic infection. However, L-arabinose supplementation does not alter the disease progression of

              infection in a microbiota-depleted mouse model. More importantly, short-term supplementation of L-arabinose fails to exert anti-diabetic effects in

              ), often affecting the health and welfare of the animal and ultimately their use as a research subject. The microbiome has been shown to be intimately connected to diet and gastrointestinal health. Here, we use shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics in fecal samples of common marmosets collected before, during, and after a dietary transition from a biscuit to a gel diet. The overall health of marmosets, measured as weight recovery and reproductive outcome, improved after the diet transition. Moreover, each marmoset pair had significant shifts in the microbiome and metabolome after the diet transition. In general, we saw a decrease in
              <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>

              species. Untargeted metabolic profiles indicated that polyamine levels, specifically cadaverine and putrescine, were high after diet transition, suggesting either an increase in excretion or a decrease in intestinal reabsorption at the intestinal level. In conclusion, our data suggest that
              <jats:italic>Bifidobacterium</jats:italic>
              species could potentially be useful as probiotic supplements to the laboratory marmoset diet. Future studies with a larger sample size will be beneficial to show that this is consistent with the diet change.

              Appropriate diet and health of the common marmoset in captivity are essential both for the welfare of the animal and to improve experimental outcomes. Our study shows that a gel diet compared to a biscuit diet improves the health of a marmoset colony, is linked to increases in
              <jats:italic>Bifidobacterium</jats:italic>
              species, and increases the removal of molecules associated with disease. The diet transition had an influence on the molecular changes at both the pair and time point group levels, but only at the pair level for the microbial changes. It appears to be more important which genes and functions present changed rather than specific microbes. Further studies are needed to identify specific components that should be considered when choosing an appropriate diet and additional supplementary foods, as well as to validate the benefits of providing probiotics. Probiotics containing
              <jats:italic>Bifidobacterium</jats:italic>
              species appear to be useful as probiotic supplements to the laboratory marmoset diet, but additional work is needed to validate these findings.

              Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are of high economic and ecological importance, owing to their diverse communities and the disproportionate role they play in carbon cycling, particularly in carbon sequestration. Organisms inhabiting these environments must overcome strong natural fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, and turbidity, as well as numerous climate change-induced disturbances such as land loss, sea level rise, and, in some locations, increasingly severe tropical cyclones that threaten to disrupt future ecosystem health. The northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) along the Louisiana coast contains dozens of estuaries, including the Mississippi–Atchafalaya River outflow, which dramatically influence the region due to their vast upstream watershed. Nevertheless, the microbiology of these estuaries and surrounding coastal environments has received little attention. To improve our understanding of microbial ecology in the understudied coastal nGoM, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene amplicon survey at eight sites and multiple time points along the Louisiana coast and one inland swamp spanning freshwater to high brackish salinities, totaling 47 duplicated Sterivex (0.2–2.7 µm) and prefilter (&gt;2.7 µm) samples. We cataloged over 13,000 Amplicon Sequence ariants (ASVs) from common freshwater and marine clades such as SAR11 (Alphaproteobacteria),
              <jats:italic>Synechococcus</jats:italic>
              (Cyanobacteria), and acI and
              <jats:italic>Candidatus</jats:italic>
              Actinomarina (Actinobacteria). We observed correlations with freshwater or marine habitats in many organisms and characterized a group of taxa with specialized distributions across brackish water sites, supporting the hypothesis of an endogenous brackish-water community. Additionally, we observed brackish-water associations for several aquatic clades typically considered marine or freshwater taxa, such as SAR11 subclade II, SAR324, and the acI Actinobacteria. The data presented here expand the geographic coverage of microbial ecology in estuarine communities, help delineate the native and transitory members of these environments, and provide critical aquatic microbiological baseline data for coastal and estuarine sites in the nGoM.

              <jats:p>Estuarine and coastal waters are diverse ecosystems influenced by tidal fluxes, interconnected wetlands, and river outflows, which are of high economic and ecological importance. Microorganisms play a pivotal role in estuaries as “first responders” and ecosystem architects, yet despite their ecological importance, they remain underrepresented in microbial studies compared to open ocean environments. This leads to substantial knowledge gaps that are important for understanding global biogeochemical cycling and making decisions about conservation and management strategies in these environments. Our study makes key contributions to the microbial ecology of estuarine and coastal habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our microbial community data support the concept of a globally distributed, core brackish microbiome and emphasize previously underrecognized brackish-water taxa. Given the projected worsening of land loss, oil spills, and natural disasters in this region, our results will serve as important baseline data for researchers investigating the microbial communities found across estuaries.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Microbial immigration is an ecological process in natural environments; however, the ecological trade-off mechanisms that govern the balance between species extinction and migration are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the migration of diazotrophic communities from soil to leaves across six natural mangrove habitats in southern China. The results showed that the diazotrophic alpha and beta diversity exhibited significant regional and locational variations. The diazotrophic species pool gradually increased from the leaves to nonrhizosphere soil at each site, exhibiting a vertical distribution pattern. Mantel test analyses suggested that climate factors, particularly mean annual temperature, significantly influenced the structure of the diazotrophic community. The diazotrophic community assembly was mainly governed by dispersal limitation in soil and root samples, whereas dispersal limitation and ecological drift were dominant in leaves. Partial least squares path modeling revealed that the species pool and soil properties, particularly the oxidation-reduction potential and pH, were closely linked to the species-immigration ratio of diazotrophic communities. Our study provides novel insights for understanding the ecological trait diversity patterns and spread pathways of functional microbial communities between below- and aboveground habitats in natural ecosystems.</jats:p>

                were more abundant in root-associated soil than in leaves by internal and external pathways. The nonrhizospheric and rhizospheric soil samples harbored the most core amplicon sequence variants, indicating that these dominant diazotrophs could adapt to broader ecological niches. Correlation analysis indicated that the diversities of the diazotrophic community were regulated by biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, this study found a lower species immigration ratio in the soil than in the leaves. Both species pool and soil properties regulate the species-immigration mechanisms of the diazotrophic community. These results suggest that substantial species immigration is a widespread ecological process, leading to alterations in local community diversity across diverse host environments.

              Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are self-assembling protein megacomplexes that encapsulate metabolic pathways. Although approximately 20% of sequenced bacterial genomes contain operons encoding putative BMCs, few have been thoroughly characterized, nor any in the most studied

                The properties of bacterial microcompartments make them an ideal tool for building orthogonal network structures with minimal interactions with native metabolic and regulatory networks. However, this requires an understanding of how BMCs work natively. In this study, we combined genetic manipulation, multi-omics, modeling, and microscopy to address this issue for Eut BMCs. We show that the Eut BMC in
                <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
                turns ethanolamine into usable carbon and nitrogen substrates to sustain growth. These results improve our understanding of compartmentalization in a widely used bacterial chassis.

                Colonization is generally the first step in pathogenesis for bacteria with pathogenic potential. This step provides a unique window for intervention since a given potential pathogen has yet to cause damage to its host. Moreover, intervention during the colonization stage may help alleviate the burden of therapy failure as antimicrobial resistance rises. Yet, to understand the therapeutic potential of interventions that target colonization, we must first understand the biology of colonization and if biomarkers at the colonization stage can be used to stratify infection risk. The bacterial genus
                <jats:italic>Klebsiella</jats:italic>
                includes many species with varying degrees of pathogenic potential. Members of the
                <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>
                species complex have the highest pathogenic potential. Patients colonized in their gut by these bacteria are at higher risk of subsequent infection with their colonizing strain. However, we do not understand if other members of the gut microbiota can be used as a biomarker to predict infection risk. In this study, we show that the gut microbiota differs between colonized patients who develop an infection versus those who do not. Additionally, we show that integrating gut microbiota data with bacterial factors improves the ability to classify infections. Surprisingly, patient clinical factors were not useful for classifying infections alone or when added to microbiota-based models. This indicates that the bacterial genotype and the microbial community in which it exists may determine the progression to infection. As we continue to explore colonization as an intervention point to prevent infections in individuals colonized by potential pathogens, we must develop effective means for predicting and stratifying infection risk.

              <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>
              , increases these microorganisms’ virulence and decreases the efficacy of common antibiotic regimens. Probiotics possess a variety of strain-specific strategies to reduce biofilm formation in competing organisms; however, the mechanisms and compounds responsible for these phenomena often go uncharacterized. In this study, we identified a mixture of small probiotic-derived peptides capable of Agr quorum sensing interference as one of the mechanisms driving antibiofilm activity against

              . This collection of peptides also improved antibiotic killing and protected human gut epithelial cells from

We conclude that purposeful strain screening and selection efforts can be used to identify unique probiotic strains that possess specially desired mechanisms of action. This information can be used to further improve our understanding of the ways in which probiotic and probiotic-derived compounds can be applied to prevent bacterial infections or improve bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics in clinical and agricultural settings.

              ) stress response-related genes that are required for the removal of reactive oxygen species (glutathione synthetase, c7144) and genes involved in the response to osmotic stress in the hemocoel, such as those encoding proteins involved in the G, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways (

                Insect hormones are highly important for the regulation of insect growth, development, and immune system function. Thus, the expansion of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) could be affected by these hormones when they inhabit the host hemocoel. However, the molecular basis of EPF in response to insect hormones has yet to be determined. Our results revealed that EPF are impacted by 20E and JH, both of which act as signals, as these hormones lead to changes in metabolic pathways of the fungus, thus demonstrating a direct relationship between the fungus and the hormones. Furthermore, adaptive strategies, such as the use of ecdysone-inactivating enzymes and secreted filamentous proteins in
                <jats:italic>H. satumaensis</jats:italic>

            <jats:p>Shotgun metagenomics allows comprehensive sampling of the genomic information of microbes in a given environment and is a tool of choice for studying complex microbial systems. Mapping sequencing reads against a set of reference or metagenome-assembled genomes is in principle a simple and powerful approach to define the species-level composition of the microbial community under investigation. However, despite the widespread use of this approach, there is no established way to properly interpret the alignment results, with arbitrary relative abundance thresholds being routinely used to discriminate between present and absent species. Such an approach can be affected by significant biases, especially in the identification of rare species. Therefore, it is important to develop new metrics to overcome these biases. Here, we present Metapresence, a new tool to perform reliable identification of the species in metagenomic samples based on the distribution of mapped reads on the reference genomes. The analysis is based on two metrics describing the breadth of coverage and the genomic distance between consecutive reads. We demonstrate the high precision and wide applicability of the tool using data from various synthetic communities, a real mock community, and the gut microbiome of healthy individuals and antibiotic-associated-diarrhea patients. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed approach has a robust performance in hard-to-analyze microbial communities containing contaminated or closely related genomes in low abundance.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>Despite the prevalent use of genome-centric alignment-based methods to characterize microbial community composition, there lacks a standardized approach for accurately identifying the species within a sample. Currently, arbitrary relative abundance thresholds are commonly employed for this purpose. However, due to the inherent complexity of genome structure and biases associated with genome-centric approaches, this practice tends to be imprecise. Notably, it introduces significant biases, particularly in the identification of rare species. The method presented here addresses these limitations and contributes significantly to overcoming inaccuracies in precisely defining community composition, especially when dealing with rare members.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Hospitals are subject to strict microbial control. Stringent cleaning and confinement measures in hospitals lead to a decrease in microbial diversity, but an increase in resistance genes. Given the rise of antimicrobial resistances and healthcare-associated infections, understanding the hospital microbiome and its resistome is crucial. This study compared the microbiome and resistome at different levels of confinement (CL) within a single hospital. Using amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and genome/plasmid reconstruction, we demonstrate that microbial composition differs in a stable way between the CLs and that the most restrictive confinement level CL1 had the lowest microbial but the highest functional diversity. This CL also exhibited a greater abundance of functions related to virulence, disease, defense, and stress response. Comparison of antibiotic resistance also showed differences among CLs in terms of the selection process and specific mechanisms for antimicrobial/antibiotic resistance. The resistances found in the samples of CL1 were mostly mediated via antibiotic efflux pumps and were mainly located on chromosomes, whereas in the other, less restrictive CL antibiotic resistances were more present on plasmids. This could be of particular importance for patient-related areas (CL2), as the potential spread of antibiotic resistances could be a major concern in this area. Our results show that there are differences in the microbiome and resistome even within a single hospital, reflecting room utilization and confinement. Since restrictive confinement selects for resistant microorganisms, strategies are required to deepen our understanding of dynamic processes of microbiome and resistome within hospital environments.</jats:p>

This study adds to previous knowledge by focusing on the conditions in a single hospital, resolving the microbiomes and their resistomes in three different confinement levels (CL): operating room, patient-related areas, and non-patient-related areas. We were able to identify stable key taxa; profiled the capacities of taxa, functions, and antimicrobial resistances (AMR); and reconstruct genomes and plasmids in each CL. Our results show that the most restrictive CL indeed had the highest functional diversity, but that resistances were mostly encoded on chromosomes, indicating a lower possibility of resistance spread.

              . At slow dilution rates, limitation by P and C appeared to alter cell growth efficiencies as reflected by changes in cellular C quotas and rates of oxygen consumption, both of which were highest under P- and lowest under C- stress. Underlying these phenotypic changes was differential gene expression of terminal oxidases used for ATP generation that allows for increased energy generation efficiency. In all treatments under fast dilution rates, KT2440 formed aggregates and biofilms, a physiological response that hindered an accurate assessment of growth rate, but which could serve as a mechanism that allows cells to remain in conditions where growth is favorable. Our findings highlight the ways that microorganisms dynamically adjust their physiology under different resource supply conditions, with distinct mechanisms depending on the limiting resource at slow growth and convergence toward an aggregative phenotype with similar compositions under conditions that attempt to force fast growth.

            <jats:p>Bacteria perform diverse redox chemistries in the periplasm, cell wall, and extracellular space. Electron transfer for these extracytosolic activities is frequently mediated by proteins with covalently bound flavins, which are attached through post-translational flavinylation by the enzyme ApbE. Despite the significance of protein flavinylation to bacterial physiology, the basis and function of this modification remain unresolved. Here we apply genomic context analyses, computational structural biology, and biochemical studies to address the role of ApbE flavinylation throughout bacterial life. We identify ApbE flavinylation sites within structurally diverse protein domains and show that multi-flavinylated proteins, which may mediate longer distance electron transfer via multiple flavinylation sites, exhibit substantial structural heterogeneity. We identify two novel classes of flavinylation substrates that are related to characterized proteins with non-covalently bound flavins, providing evidence that protein flavinylation can evolve from a non-covalent flavoprotein precursor. We further find a group of structurally related flavinylation-associated cytochromes, including those with the domain of unknown function DUF4405, that presumably mediate electron transfer in the cytoplasmic membrane. DUF4405 homologs are widespread in bacteria and related to ferrosome iron storage organelle proteins that may facilitate iron redox cycling within ferrosomes. These studies reveal a complex basis for flavinylated electron transfer and highlight the discovery power of coupling comparative genomic analyses with high-quality structural models.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>This study explores the mechanisms bacteria use to transfer electrons outside the cytosol, a fundamental process involved in energy metabolism and environmental interactions. Central to this process is a phenomenon known as flavinylation, where a flavin molecule—a compound related to vitamin B2—is covalently attached to proteins, to enable electron transfer. We employed advanced genomic analysis and computational modeling to explore how this modification occurs across different bacterial species. Our findings uncover new types of proteins that undergo this modification and highlight the diversity and complexity of bacterial electron transfer mechanisms. This research broadens our understanding of bacterial physiology and informs potential biotechnological applications that rely on microbial electron transfer, including bioenergy production and bioremediation.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Modeling microbial metabolic dynamics is important for the rational optimization of both biosynthetic systems and industrial processes to facilitate green and efficient biomanufacturing. Classical approaches utilize explicit equation systems to represent metabolic networks, enabling the quantification of pathway fluxes to identify metabolic bottlenecks. However, these white-box models, despite their diverse applications, have limitations in simulating metabolic dynamics and are intrinsically inaccurate for industrial strains that lack information on network structures and kinetic parameters. On the other hand, black-box models do not rely on prior mechanistic knowledge of strains but are built upon observed time-series trajectories of biosynthetic systems in action. In practice, these observations are typically irregular, with discontinuously observed time points across multiple independent batches, each time point potentially containing missing measurements. Learning from such irregular data remains challenging for existing approaches. To address this issue, we present the Bidirectional Time-Series State Transfer Network (BTSTN) for modeling metabolic dynamics directly from irregular observations. Using evaluation data sets derived from both ideal dynamic systems and a real-world fermentation process, we demonstrate that BTSTN accurately reconstructs dynamic behaviors and predicts future trajectories. This approach exhibits enhanced robustness against missing measurements and noise, as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>Industrial biosynthetic systems often involve strains with unclear genetic backgrounds, posing challenges in modeling their distinct metabolic dynamics. In such scenarios, white-box models, which commonly rely on inferred networks, are thereby of limited applicability and accuracy. In contrast, black-box models, such as statistical models and neural networks, are directly fitted or learned from observed time-series trajectories of biosynthetic systems in action. These methods typically assume regular observations without missing time points or measurements. If the observations are irregular, a pre-processing step becomes necessary to obtain a fully filled data set for subsequent model training, which, at the same time, inevitably introduces errors into the resulting models. BTSTN is a novel approach that natively learns from irregular observations. This distinctive feature makes it a unique addition to the current arsenal of technologies modeling metabolic dynamics.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Metagenomic sequencing has advanced our understanding of biogeochemical processes by providing an unprecedented view into the microbial composition of different ecosystems. While the amount of metagenomic data has grown rapidly, simple-to-use methods to analyze and compare across studies have lagged behind. Thus, tools expressing the metabolic traits of a community are needed to broaden the utility of existing data. Gene abundance profiles are a relatively low-dimensional embedding of a metagenome’s functional potential and are, thus, tractable for comparison across many samples. Here, we compare the abundance of KEGG Ortholog Groups (KOs) from 6,539 metagenomes from the Joint Genome Institute’s Integrated Microbial Genomes and Metagenomes (JGI IMG/M) database. We find that samples cluster into terrestrial, aquatic, and anaerobic ecosystems with marker KOs reflecting adaptations to these environments. For instance, functional clusters were differentiated by the metabolism of antibiotics, photosynthesis, methanogenesis, and surprisingly GC content. Using this functional gene approach, we reveal the broad-scale patterns shaping microbial communities and demonstrate the utility of ortholog abundance profiles for representing a rapidly expanding body of metagenomic data.</jats:p>

Metagenome databases were created to compile sequencing data across studies, but it remains challenging to compare and gain insight from these large data sets. Consequently, there is a need to develop accessible approaches to extract knowledge across metagenomes. The abundance of different orthologs (i.e., genes that perform a similar function across species) provides a simplified representation of a metagenome’s metabolic potential that can easily be compared with others. In this study, we cluster the ortholog abundance profiles of thousands of metagenomes from diverse environments and uncover the traits that distinguish them. This work provides a simple to use framework for functional comparison and advances our understanding of how the environment shapes microbial communities.</jats:p>

Top-down community engineering is a promising strategy that could be used to obtain communities of desired function. However, the ecological factors that control the balance between community shaping and propagation are not well understood. Dairy backslopping, which consists of using part of the previous production to inoculate a new one, can be used as a model engineering approach to investigate community dynamics during serial propagations. In this study, 26 raw milk samples were serially propagated 6 times each, giving rise to 26 community lineages. Bacterial community structures were analyzed by metabarcoding, and acidification was recorded by pH monitoring. The results revealed that different types of community lineages could be obtained in terms of taxonomic composition and dynamics. Five lineages reached a repeatable community structure in a few propagation steps, with little variation between the final generations, giving rise to stable acidification kinetics. Moreover, these stabilized communities presented a high variability of structure and diverse acidification properties between community lineages. Besides, the other lineages were characterized by different levels of dynamics leading to parallel or divergent trajectories. The functional properties and dynamics of the communities were mainly related to the relative abundance and the taxonomic composition of lactic acid bacteria within the communities. These findings highlight that short-term schemes of serial fermentation can produce communities with a wide range of dynamics and that the balance between community shaping and propagation is intimately linked to community structure.</jats:p>

The microbiomes had a high degree of host specificity in terms of taxonomic composition and potential functions, including CAZymes profiles. Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were abundant across all microalgal hosts, but

              microbiomes had a much higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, whereas the two other algal microbiomes had higher relative abundances of Rhodobacteraceae. This could be due to the bacterivorous mixotrophic nature of
              <jats:italic>I. galbana</jats:italic>
              affecting the carbohydrate composition available to the microbiomes, which was supported by the CAZymes profile of

The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and horizontal transfer mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from eight strains of NTS detected in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, China. Fecal samples from outpatients with food-borne diarrhea were collected in 2022. The NTS isolates were identified, and their susceptibility was tested with the Vitek 2 Compact system. The genomes of the NTS isolates were sequenced with the Illumina NovaSeq platform and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. The AMR genes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were predicted with the relevant open access resources. Eight strains of NTS were isolated from 153 specimens, and

Eleven MGEs carrying 34 AMR genes were identified on the chromosomes of 3 of the 8 NTS, including 3 resistance islands, 6 composite transposons (Tns), and 2 integrons. Eighteen plasmids carrying 40 AMR genes were detected in the 8 NTS strains, including 6 mobilizable plasmids, 3 conjugative plasmids, and 9 nontransferable plasmids, 7 of which carried 10 composite Tns and 3 integrons. This study provided a theoretical basis, from a genetic perspective, for the prevention and control of NTS resistance in Zhenjiang City.

              Mexican Americans are disproportionally affected by metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which often co-occurs with diabetes. Despite extensive evidence on the causative role of the gut microbiome in MASLD, studies determining the involvement of the gut phageome are scarce. In this cross-sectional study, we characterized the gut phageome in Mexican Americans of South Texas by stool shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 340 subjects, concurrently screened for liver steatosis by transient elastography. Inter-individual variations in the phageome were associated with gender, country of birth, diabetes, and liver steatosis. The phage signatures for diabetes and liver steatosis were subsequently determined. Enrichment of

              (Mtb) exposure leads to a range of outcomes including clearance, latent TB infection (LTBI), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Some heavily exposed individuals resist tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) release assay (IGRA) conversion (RSTR), which suggests that they employ IFNγ-independent mechanisms of Mtb control. Here, we compare monocyte epigenetic profiles of RSTR and LTBI from a Ugandan household contact cohort. Chromatin accessibility did not differ between uninfected RSTR and LTBI monocytes. By contrast, methylation significantly differed at 174 CpG sites and across 63 genomic regions. Consistent with previous transcriptional findings in this cohort, differential methylation was enriched in lipid- and cholesterol-associated pathways including the genes APOC3, KCNQ1, and PLA2G3. In addition, methylation was enriched in Hippo signaling, which is associated with cholesterol homeostasis and includes CIT and SHANK2. Lipid export and Hippo signaling pathways were also associated with gene expression in response to Mtb in RSTR as well as IFN stimulation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from an independent healthy donor cohort. Moreover, serum-derived high-density lipoprotein from RSTR had elevated ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) compared to LTBI. Our findings suggest that resistance to TST/IGRA conversion is linked to regulation of lipid accumulation in monocytes, which could facilitate early Mtb clearance among RSTR subjects through IFNγ-independent mechanisms.

                <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
                often results in latent TB latent infection (LTBI), subpopulations exist that are either resistant to infection or contain Mtb with interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-independent mechanisms not indicative of LTBI. These resisters provide an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of TB disease and discover novel therapeutic targets. Here, we compare monocyte epigenetic profiles of RSTR and LTBI from a Ugandan household contact cohort. We identify methylation signatures in host lipid and cholesterol pathways with potential relevance to early TB clearance before the sustained IFN responses indicative of LTBI. This adds to a growing body of literature linking TB disease outcomes to host lipids.

            <jats:p>Ocean and estuarine microbiomes play critical roles in global element cycling and ecosystem function. Despite the importance of these microbial communities, many species still have not been cultured in the lab. Environmental sequencing is the primary way the function and population dynamics of these communities can be studied. Long-read sequencing provides an avenue to overcome limitations of short-read technologies to obtain complete microbial genomes but comes with its own technical challenges, such as needed sequencing depth and obtaining high-quality DNA. We present here new sampling and bioinformatics methods to attempt decomposing an estuarine microbiome into its constituent genomes. Our results suggest there are only a few strains that comprise most of the species abundances from viruses to picoeukaryotes, and to fully decompose a metagenome of this diversity requires 1 Tbp of long-read sequencing. We anticipate that as long-read sequencing technologies continue to improve, less sequencing will be needed.</jats:p>

              gene resulting in loss of function of the carbon catabolite repression protein Crc. Furthermore, the combined absence of RhlR and CbrA leads to a drastic reduction in the abundance of the Crc antagonist small RNA CrcZ. Thus, CrcZ acts as the molecular convergence point for quorum- and nutrient-sensing cues. We find that in the absence of antagonism by CrcZ, Crc promotes the expression of biofilm matrix components—Pel exopolysaccharide, and CupB and CupC fimbriae. Therefore, this study uncovers a regulatory link between nutritional adaption and quorum sensing with potential implications for anti-biofilm targeting strategies.

                Bacteria often form multicellular communities encased in an extracytoplasmic matrix called biofilms. Biofilm development is controlled by various environmental stimuli that are decoded and converted into appropriate cellular responses. To understand how information from two distinct stimuli is integrated, we used biofilm formation in the human pathogen
                <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
                as a model and studied the intersection of two global sensory signaling pathways—quorum sensing and nutritional adaptation. Global transcriptomics on biofilm cells and reporter assays suggest parallel regulation of biofilms by each pathway that converges on the abundance of a small RNA antagonist of the carbon catabolite repression protein, Crc. We find a new role of Crc as it modulates the expression of biofilm matrix components in response to the environment. These results expand our understanding of the genetic regulatory strategies that allow

              Targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized the way we look at bacterial communities. It can be used for the species-specific detection of bacteria as well as for the determination of the microbiome and resistome and can be applied to samples from almost any environment. However, the results of targeted HTS can be influenced by many factors, which poses a major challenge for its use in clinical diagnostics. In this study, we investigated the impact of the DNA extraction method on the determination of the bacterial microbiome and resistome by targeted HTS using principles from metrology and diagnostics such as repeatability and analytical sensitivity. Sputum samples spiked with

DNA was extracted from each sample on 2 separate days in three replicates each using three different extraction methods based on cetrimonium bromide, magnetic beads, and silica membranes. All three spiked bacteria were detected in sputum, and the DNA extraction method had no significant effect on detection. However, the DNA extraction method had significant effects on the composition of the microbiome and the resistome. The sequencing results were repeatable in the majority of cases. The silica membrane-based DNA extraction kit provided the most repeatable results and the highest diversity of the microbiome and resistome. Targeted HTS has been shown to be a reliable tool for determining the microbiome and resistome; however, the method of DNA extraction should be carefully selected to minimize its impact on the results.

            <jats:p>High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is one of the crucial new technologies that gives us insights into previously hidden parts of microbial communities. The DNA extraction method is an important step that can have a major impact on the results, and understanding this impact is of paramount importance for their reliable interpretation. Our results are of great value for the interpretation of sputum microbiome and resistome results obtained by targeted HTS. Our findings allow for a more rational design of future microbiome studies, which would lead to higher repeatability of results and easier comparison between different laboratories. This could also facilitate the introduction of targeted HTS in clinical microbiology for reliable identification of pathogenic bacteria and testing for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As AMR is a major threat to public health, the improved methods for determining AMR would bring great benefits to both the healthcare system and society as a whole.</jats:p>

Recent studies have revealed that specific microbial species directly instigate mutations in the host nucleus DNA, thereby accelerating the progression of colorectal cancer. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in promoting colorectal cancer, it is reasonable to postulate that gut microbes may induce mitochondrial gene mutations, thereby inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we focus on gut microbial genotoxins and their known and potential targets in mitochondrial genes. Consequently, we propose that targeted disruption of genotoxin transport pathways may effectively reduce the rate of mitochondrial gene mutations and yield substantial benefits for the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.</jats:p>

              (MRSA) sequence type 630 (ST630) is a rarely reported lineage worldwide. This study aimed to trace the dissemination of the emerging MRSA ST630 clones in China and investigate their virulence potential. We collected 22 ST630-MRSA isolates from across China and performed whole-genome sequencing analysis and virulence characterization on these isolates. Epidemiological results showed that MRSA ST630 isolates were primarily isolated from pus/wound secretions, mainly originating from Jiangxi province, and carried diverse virulence and drug resistance genes. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type V (SCCmec V) predominated (11/22, 50.0%) among the MRSA ST630 isolates. Interestingly, nearly half (45.5%) of the 22 ST630-MRSA isolates tested lacked intact SCCmec elements. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that ST630-MRSA could be divided into two distinct clades, with widespread dissemination mainly in Chinese regions. Five representative isolates were selected for phenotypic assays, including hemolysin activity, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, western blot analysis, hydrogen peroxide killing assay, blood killing assay, cell adhesion and invasion assay, and mouse skin abscess model. The results showed that, compared to the USA300-LAC strain, ST630 isolates exhibited particularly strong invasiveness and virulence in the aforementioned phenotypic assays. This study described the emergence of a highly virulent ST630-MRSA lineage and improved our insight into the molecular epidemiology of ST630 clones in China.

Furthermore, tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed abundant differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the CMSs compared with P2. Of these, seven key fitness-related DEPs distributed in two-component systems, galactose and tryptophan metabolism pathways, were verified using parallel reaction monitoring analysis. The DEPs in the CMSs influenced bacterial motility, environmental stress tolerance, colonization ability, carbohydrate utilization, cell morphology maintenance, and chemotaxis to restore fitness costs and adapt to the mammalian gut environment.

In this study, we employed a meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously characterize the infectome contributing to different disease syndromes and to investigate spatial, demographic, and ecological factors influencing pathogen diversity and community composition in a cohort of 27 hospitalized cats and seven stray cats.

We demonstrated that the increase in infectome diversity can be explained by a variety of predictors including age growth, temperature increase, and a higher proportion of females, with age growth presenting the strongest effect. Fine-scale analysis indicated that a higher diversity of infectomes were harbored in young cats rather than adult ones. Our results demonstrated that most feline diseases are better explained by the presence of virus–bacteria or virus–virus coinfection. This study serves as a timely endorsement for clinical diagnosis by vets to consider the cause of a disease based on a panel of cryptical co-infecting pathogens rather than on individual infectious agents.

Cats have a physically close interaction with their owners through activities like petting, kissing, and being licked on the cheek and hands.

After 12 days of evolution, we measured a decrease in spontaneous induction in both exponential and stationary phase growth. Co-existing variation in spontaneous induction rates in the exponential phase depended on the way the coexisting strains resolved genetic conflict. Multiple mutational modes to resolve genetic conflict between host and phage resulted in coexistence in evolved populations of single lysogens that maintained CRISPR immunity to other phages and polylysogens that lost immunity completely. This work highlights a new dimension of the role of lysogenic phages in the evolution of their hosts.

            <jats:p>Characterization of microbial community metabolic output is crucial to understanding their functions. Construction of genome-scale metabolic models from metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) has enabled prediction of metabolite production by microbial communities, yet little is known about their accuracy. Here, we examined the performance of two approaches for metabolite prediction from metagenomes, one that is MAG-guided and another that is taxonomic reference-guided. We applied both on shotgun metagenomics data from human and environmental samples, and validated findings in the human samples using untargeted metabolomics. We found that in human samples, where taxonomic profiling is optimized and reference genomes are readily available, when number of input taxa was normalized, the reference-guided approach predicted more metabolites than the MAG-guided approach. The two approaches showed significant overlap but each identified metabolites not predicted in the other. Pathway enrichment analyses identified significant differences in inferences derived from data based on the approach, highlighting the need for caution in interpretation. In environmental samples, when the number of input taxa was normalized, the reference-guided approach predicted more metabolites than the MAG-guided approach for total metabolites in both sample types and non-redundant metabolites in seawater samples. Nonetheless, as was observed for the human samples, the approaches overlapped substantially but also predicted metabolites not observed in the other. Our findings report on utility of a complementary input to genome-scale metabolic model construction that is less computationally intensive forgoing MAG assembly and refinement, and that can be applied on shallow shotgun sequencing where MAGs cannot be generated.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>Little is known about the accuracy of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of microbial communities despite their influence on inferring community metabolic outputs and culture conditions. The performance of GEMs for metabolite prediction from metagenomes was assessed by applying two approaches on shotgun metagenomics data from human and environmental samples, and validating findings in the human samples using untargeted metabolomics. The performance of the approach was found to be dependent on sample type, but collectively, the reference-guided approach predicted more metabolites than the MAG-guided approach. Despite the differences, the predictions from the approaches overlapped substantially but each identified metabolites not predicted in the other. We found significant differences in biological inferences based on the approach, with some examples of uniquely enriched pathways in one group being invalidated when using the alternative approach, highlighting the need for caution in interpretation of GEMs.</jats:p>

              As antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance shifts to genomics, ensuring the quality of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data produced across laboratories is critical. Participation in genomic proficiency tests (GPTs) not only increases individual laboratories' WGS capacity but also provides a unique opportunity to improve species-specific thresholds for WGS quality control (QC) by repeated resequencing of distinct isolates. Here, we present the results of the EU Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance (EURL-AR) network GPTs of 2021 and 2022, which included 25 EU national reference laboratories (NLRs). A total of 392 genomes from 12 AMR-bacteria were evaluated based on WGS QC metrics. Two percent (
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 9) of the data were excluded, due to contamination, and 11% (
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 41) of the remaining genomes were identified as outliers in at least one QC metric and excluded from computation of the adjusted QC thresholds (AQT). Two QC metric correlation groups were identified through linear regression. Eight percent (
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 28) of the submitted genomes, from 11 laboratories, failed one or more of the AQTs. However, only three laboratories (12%) were identified as underperformers, failing across AQTs for uncorrelated QC metrics in at least two genomes. Finally, new species-specific thresholds for “N50” and “number of contigs &gt; 200 bp” are presented for guidance in routine laboratory QC. The continued participation of NRLs in GPTs will reveal WGS workflow flaws and improve AMR surveillance data. GPT data will continue to contribute to the development of reliable species-specific thresholds for routine WGS QC, standardizing sequencing data QC and ensure inter- and intranational laboratory comparability.

              <jats:p>Illumina next-generation sequencing is an integral part of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and the most widely used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) platform. The high-throughput, relative low-cost, high discriminatory power, and rapid turnaround time of WGS compared to classical biochemical methods means the technology will likely remain a fundamental tool in AMR surveillance and public health. In this study, we present the current level of WGS capacity among national reference laboratories in the EU Reference Laboratory for AMR network, summarizing applied methodology and statistically evaluating the quality of the obtained sequence data. These findings provide the basis for setting new and revised thresholds for quality metrics used in routine WGS, which have previously been arbitrarily defined. In addition, underperforming participants are identified and encouraged to evaluate their workflows to produce reliable results.</jats:p>

              Horizontal gene transfer is one of the main mechanisms by which bacteria acquire new genes. However, it represents only the first step as the transferred genes have also to be functionally and regulatory integrated into the recipient’s cellular machinery.

              , a member of bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadota, acquired its photosynthesis genes via distant horizontal gene transfer from a purple bacterium. Thus, it represents a unique natural experiment, in which the entire package of photosynthesis genes was transplanted into a distant host. We show that

              lacks the regulation of photosynthesis gene expressions in response to oxygen concentration and light intensity that are common in purple bacteria. This restricts its growth to low-light habitats with reduced oxygen. Understanding the regulation of horizontally transferred genes is important not only for microbial evolution but also for synthetic biology and the engineering of novel organisms, as these rely on the successful integration of foreign genes.

Under acid, neutral, or alkaline pH, a total of 115 genes are needed for primary attachment under one or more environmental pH, with 22 genes required for all. These include components of cell surfaces and membranes, together with enzymes that construct and modify them. Mechanisms of dealing with stress also play a part; however, exact requirements vary depending on environmental pH. RNASeq showed that knocking out the two transcriptional regulators required for attachment causes massive changes in the bacterial cell surface. Approximately half of the 54 proteins required for attachment at pH 7.0 have a role in the later stages of nodule formation. We found no evidence for a single rhicadhesin responsible for alkaline attachment, although sonicated cell surface fractions inhibited root attachment at alkaline pH. Our results demonstrate the complexity of primary root attachment and illustrate the diversity of mechanisms involved.

The highest performance was achieved for modern β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor drugs, namely, ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam. For these drugs, the model demonstrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.869 and 0.856, specificity of 0.925 and 0.897, and sensitivity of 0.731 and 0.714, respectively. As part of this work, we developed dynamic binning, a feature engineering technique that effectively reduces the high-dimensional feature set and has wide-ranging applicability to MALDI-TOF MS data. Compared to conventional feature engineering approaches, the dynamic binning method yielded highest performance in 7 of 10 antimicrobials. Moreover, we showcased the efficacy of transfer learning in enhancing the AUROC performance for 8 of 11 antimicrobials. By assessing the contribution of features to the model's prediction, we identified proteins that may contribute to AMR mechanisms.

              Metabolic exchange plays a crucial role in shaping microbial community interactions and functions, including the exchange of small molecules such as cofactors. Cofactors are fundamental to enzyme catalytic activities; however, the role of cofactors in microbial stress tolerance is unclear. Here, we constructed a synergistic consortium containing two strains that could efficiently mineralize di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate under hyperosmotic stress. Integration of transcriptomic analysis, metabolic profiling, and a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) facilitated the discovery of the potential mechanism of microbial interactions. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the vitamin B

              to enhance biofilm formation, and the species collaborate with each other by exchanging cofactors to improve consortium hyperosmotic stress tolerance. These findings offer new insights into the role of cofactors in microbial interactions and stress tolerance and are potentially exploitable for environmental remediation.

              Enhancing the availability of representative isolates from hydrothermal vents (HTVs) is imperative for comprehending the microbial processes that propel the vent ecosystem. In recent years, Campylobacteria have emerged as the predominant and ubiquitous taxon across both shallow and deep-sea vent systems. Nevertheless, only a few isolates have been cultured, primarily originating from deep-sea HTVs. Presently, no cultivable isolates of Campylobacteria are accessible in shallow water vent systems (&lt;200 m), which exhibit markedly distinct environmental conditions from their deep-sea counterparts. In this study, we enriched a novel isolate (genus
              <jats:italic>Sulfurospirillum</jats:italic>
              , Campylobacteria) from shallow-water HTVs of Kueishan Island. Genomic and physiological analysis revealed that this novel Campylobacteria species grows on a variety of substrate and carbon/energy sources. The pan-genome and phenotypic comparisons with 12 previously isolated

To conclude, the metabolic characteristics of this novel Campylobacteria augment our understanding of Campylobacteria spanning from deep-sea to shallow-water vent systems.

                Campylobacteria emerge as the dominant and ubiquitous taxa within vent systems, playing important roles in the vent ecosystems. However, isolated representatives of Campylobacteria have been mainly from the deep-sea hydrothermal fields, leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding the functions, activities, and adaptation strategies of the vent microorganisms in shallow-water hydrothermal vents (HTVs).

Eighty-nine foods were individually combined with breastmilk, and the 12 combinations with the strongest influence on the microbial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) were identified. Fiber-rich and polyphenol-rich foods, like pumpkin and blackcurrant, resulted in the greatest increase in predicted fluxes of total SCFAs and individual fluxes of propionate and acetate when combined, respectively, with breastmilk. Identified foods were further combined with other foods and breastmilk, resulting in 66 multiple food-breastmilk combinations. These combinations altered

              The global rise of antibiotic resistance has renewed interest in phage therapy, as an alternative to antibiotics to eliminate multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. However, optimizing the broad-spectrum efficacy of phage therapy remains a challenge. In this study, we addressed this issue by employing strategies to improve antimicrobial efficacy of phage therapy against MDR
              <jats:italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:italic>
              strains, which are notorious for their resistance to conventional antibiotics. This includes the selection of broad host range phages, optimization of phage formulation, and combinations with last-resort antibiotics. Our findings unveil that having a broad host range was a dominant trait of isolated phages, and increasing phage numbers in combination with antibiotics significantly enhanced the suppression of bacterial growth. The decreased incidence of bacterial infection was explained by a reduction in pathogen density and emergence of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) demonstrated considerable broad-spectrum antibacterial potential against different clades of clinical MDR
              <jats:italic>K. pneumoniae</jats:italic>

One important goal of this study was to optimize the therapeutic efficiency of phage-antibiotic combinations, known as phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS). Through comprehensive analysis of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of a large number of CRKp-specific phages, we developed a systematic model for phage cocktail combinations.

              Weaning weight is a reflection of management during the breastfeeding phase and will influence animal performance in subsequent phases, considered important indicators within production systems. The aims of this study were as follows: (i) to investigate variability in the growth rate among individual lambs from ewes rearing single or twin lambs fed with two different diets and (ii) to explore the molecular mechanisms regulating the growth rate and the potential long-term effects on the host. No significant change in lamb average daily gain (ADG) was observed in litter size and diet treatment, and there were large variations among individual lambs (ranging from 0.13 to 0.41 kg/day). Further analysis was conducted on serum amino acids, rumen fermentation characteristics, rumen metagenomics and transcriptome, and hepatic transcriptome of lambs with extremely high (HA;
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 6) and low (LA;
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 6) ADG. We observed significant increases in serum lysine, leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine in the HA group. The metagenome revealed that the HA group presented a higher rumen propionate molar proportion via increasing gene abundance in the succinate pathway for propionate synthesis. For the rumen transcriptome, higher expressed gene sets in the HA group were mainly related to rumen epithelial growth, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and adherens junction. For the liver transcriptome, the upregulated KEGG pathways in the HA group were primarily associated with fatty acid degradation, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and the immune system. This research suggests that preweaning lambs with high ADG may benefit from rumen development and enhanced liver metabolic and immune function.

              Intestinal helminth parasite (IHP) infection induces alterations in the composition of microbial communities across vertebrates, although how gut microbiota may facilitate or hinder parasite infection remains poorly defined. In this work, we utilized a zebrafish model to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and IHP infection. We found that extreme disparity in zebrafish parasite infection burden is linked to the composition of the gut microbiome and that changes in the gut microbiome are associated with variation in a class of endogenously produced signaling compounds, N-acylethanolamines, that are known to be involved in parasite infection. Using a statistical mediation analysis, we uncovered a set of gut microbes whose relative abundance explains the association between gut metabolites and infection outcomes. Experimental investigation of one of the compounds in this analysis reveals salicylaldehyde, which is putatively produced by the gut microbe

            <jats:p>Intestinal helminth parasites (IHPs) impact human health globally and interfere with animal health and agricultural productivity. While anthelmintics are critical to controlling parasite infections, their efficacy is increasingly compromised by drug resistance. Recent investigations suggest the gut microbiome might mediate helminth infection dynamics. So, identifying how gut microbes interact with parasites could yield new therapeutic targets for infection prevention and management. We conducted a study using a zebrafish model of parasitic infection to identify routes by which gut microbes might impact helminth infection outcomes. Our research linked the gut microbiome to both parasite infection and to metabolites in the gut to understand how microbes could alter parasite infection. We identified a metabolite in the gut, salicylaldehyde, that is putatively produced by a gut microbe and that inhibits parasitic egg growth. Our results also point to a class of compounds, N-acyl-ethanolamines, which are affected by changes in the gut microbiome and are linked to parasite infection. Collectively, our results indicate the gut microbiome may be a source of novel anthelmintics that can be harnessed to control IHPs.</jats:p>

              Engineering identical genetic circuits into different species typically results in large differences in performance due to the unique cellular environmental context of each host, a phenomenon known as the “chassis-effect” or ""context-dependency"". A better understanding of how genomic and physiological contexts underpin the chassis-effect will improve biodesign strategies across diverse microorganisms. Here, we combined a pangenomic-based gene expression analysis with quantitative measurements of performance from an engineered genetic inverter device to uncover how genome structure and function relate to the observed chassis-effect across six closely related
              <jats:italic>Stutzerimonas</jats:italic>
              hosts. Our results reveal that genome architecture underpins divergent responses between our chosen non-model bacterial hosts to the engineered device. Specifically, differential expression of the core genome, gene clusters shared between all hosts, was found to be the main source of significant concordance to the observed differential genetic device performance, whereas specialty genes from respective accessory genomes were not significant. A data-driven investigation revealed that genes involved in denitrification and components of trans-membrane transporter proteins were among the most differentially expressed gene clusters between hosts in response to the genetic device. Our results show that the chassis-effect can be traced along differences among the most conserved genome-encoded functions and that these differences create a unique biodesign space among closely related species.

                Contemporary synthetic biology endeavors often default to a handful of model organisms to host their engineered systems. Model organisms such as
                <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
                serve as attractive hosts due to their tractability but do not necessarily provide the ideal environment to optimize performance. As more novel microbes are domesticated for use as biotechnology platforms, synthetic biologists are urged to explore the chassis-design space to optimize their systems and deliver on the promises of synthetic biology. The consequences of the chassis-effect will therefore only become more relevant as the field of biodesign grows. In our work, we demonstrate that the performance of a genetic device is highly dependent on the host environment it operates within, promoting the notion that the chassis can be considered a design variable to tune circuit function. Importantly, our results unveil that the chassis-effect can be traced along similarities in genome architecture, specifically the shared core genome. Our study advocates for the exploration of the chassis-design space and is a step forward to empowering synthetic biologists with knowledge for more efficient exploration of the chassis-design space to enable the next generation of broad-host-range synthetic biology.

              Gut dysbiosis is closely related to dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the intestinal epithelial cells, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD). We investigated the relationship between fecal gut microbiome (GM) and intestinal tissue miRNAs in different stages of pediatric CD. Metagenomic analysis and miRNA sequencing were conducted to examine the GM and intestinal miRNA profiles of CD patients before and after clinical induction therapy and the controls. Twenty-seven newly diagnosed, therapy-naïve pediatric patients with active CD and 11 non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) controls were recruited in this study. Among CD patients, 11 patients completed induction treatment and reached clinical remission. Both GM and miRNA profiles were significantly changed between CD patients and controls. Seven key bacteria were identified at species level including

Eight key miRNAs were also identified including hsa-miR-215-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p, hsa-miR-12135, hsa-miR-509-3-5p, hsa-miR-212-5p, hsa-miR-4448, hsa-miR-501-3p, and hsa-miR-503-5p. The functional enrichment analysis of differential miRNAs indicated the significantly altered cyclin protein, cyclin-dependent protein, and cell cycle pathway. The close interactions between seven key bacteria and eight key miRNAs were further investigated by miRNA target prediction. The association between specific miRNA expressions and key gut bacteria at different stages of CD supported their important roles as potential molecular biomarkers. Understanding the relationship between them will help us to explore the molecular mechanisms of CD.

            <jats:p>Elemental profiling of fungal species as a phenotyping tool is an understudied topic and is typically performed to examine plant tissue or non-biological materials. Traditional analytical techniques such as inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) have been used to identify elemental profiles of fungi; however, these techniques can be cumbersome due to the difficulty of preparing samples. Additionally, the instruments used for these techniques can be expensive to procure and operate. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an alternative elemental analytical technique—one that is sensitive across the periodic table, easy to use on various sample types, and is cost-effective in both procurement and operation. LIBS has not been used on axenic filamentous fungal isolates grown in substrate media. In this work, as a proof of concept, we used LIBS on two genetically distinct fungal species grown on a nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor substrate media to determine whether robust elemental profiles can be detected and whether differences between the fungal isolates can be identified. Our results demonstrate a distinct correlation between fungal species and their elemental profile, regardless of the substrate media, as the same strains shared a similar uptake of carbon, zinc, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium, which could play a vital role in their survival and propagation. Independently, each fungal species exhibited a unique elemental profile. This work demonstrates a unique and valuable approach to rapidly phenotype fungi through optical spectroscopy, and this approach can be critical in understanding these fungi's behavior and interactions with the environment.</jats:p>

To our knowledge, ionomic profiling of microbes, particularly fungi, has not been investigated to answer applied and fundamental biological questions. The reason is that current ionomic analytical techniques can be laborious in sample preparation, fail to measure all potential elements accurately, are cost-prohibitive, or provide inconsistent results across replications. In our previous efforts, we explored whether laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) could be used in determining the elemental profiles of poplar tissue, which was successful. In this proof-of-concept endeavor, we undertook a transdisciplinary effort between applied and fundamental mycology and elemental analytical techniques to address the biological question of how LIBS can used for fungi grown axenically in a nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor environment.</jats:p>

              Nitrogen (N)-fixing organisms, also known as diazotrophs, play a crucial role in N-limited ecosystems by controlling the production of bioavailable N. The carbon-dominated cold-seep ecosystems are inherently N-limited, making them hotspots of N fixation. However, the knowledge of diazotrophs in cold-seep ecosystems is limited compared to other marine ecosystems. In this study, we used multi-omics to investigate the diversity and catabolism of diazotrophs in deep-sea cold-seep bottom waters. Our findings showed that the relative abundance of diazotrophs in the bacterial community reached its highest level in the cold-seep bottom waters compared to the cold-seep upper waters and non-seep bottom waters. Remarkably, more than 98% of metatranscriptomic reads aligned on diazotrophs in cold-seep bottom waters belonged to the genus
              <jats:italic>Sagittula</jats:italic>
              , an alphaproteobacterium. Its metagenome-assembled genome, named Seep-BW-D1, contained catalytic genes (

In addition, we observed abundant transcripts mapped to genes involved in the transport systems for acetate, spermidine/putrescine, and pectin oligomers, suggesting that Seep-BW-D1 can utilize organics from the intermediates synthesized by methane-oxidizing microorganisms, decaying tissues from cold-seep benthic animals, and refractory pectin derived from upper photosynthetic ecosystems. Overall, our study corroborates that carbon-dominated cold-seep bottom waters select for diazotrophs and reveals the catabolism of a novel chemosynthetic alphaproteobacterial diazotroph in cold-seep bottom waters.

              Bioavailable nitrogen (N) is a crucial element for cellular growth and division, and its production is controlled by diazotrophs. Marine diazotrophs contribute to nearly half of the global fixed N and perform N fixation in various marine ecosystems. While previous studies mainly focused on diazotrophs in the sunlit ocean and oxygen minimum zones, recent research has recognized cold-seep ecosystems as overlooked N-fixing hotspots because the seeping fluids in cold-seep ecosystems introduce abundant bioavailable carbon but little bioavailable N, making most cold seeps inherently N-limited. With thousands of cold-seep ecosystems detected at continental margins worldwide in the past decades, the significant role of cold seeps in marine N biogeochemical cycling is emphasized. However, the diazotrophs in cold-seep bottom waters remain poorly understood. Through multi-omics, this study identified a novel alphaproteobacterial chemoheterotroph belonging to

Imbalanced cytokines in patients were demonstrated to be associated with gut dysbiosis, which led us to suspect that B-CS is associated with gut microbiota and immune dysregulation. Next, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) mice models examined the link between gut dysbiosis and B-CS. FMT models showed damaged liver tissues, posterior inferior vena cava, and increased

Furthermore, a significant increase of the same cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-13) and endotoxin levels in B-CS-FMT mice were observed. Our study suggested that gut microbial dysbiosis may cause B-CS through immunological dysregulation.

Gut dysbiosis enhanced intestinal permeability, and toxic metabolites and imbalanced cytokines activated the immune system. Consequently, the escalation of causative factors led to their concentration in the portal vein, thereby compromising both the liver parenchyma and outflow tract. Therefore, we proposed that gut microbial dysbiosis induced immune imbalance by chronic systemic inflammation, which contributed to the B-CS development. Furthermore,

              The vaginal microbiome (VM) is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and progression, but a thorough understanding of the relation between HPV infection, and VM needs to be elucidated. From August to December 2022, women who underwent routine gynecological examinations were screened for HPV infection. The distribution of HPV variants and clinical characteristics were collected. Then, a total of 185 participants were enrolled and divided into HPV-negative (HC), high-risk HPV (H), low-risk HPV (L), multiple high-risk HPV (HH), and mixed high-low risk HPV (HL) groups. Samples were collected from the mid-vagina of these 185 participants and sent for 16S rDNA sequencing (V3–V4 region). Among 712 HPV-positive women, the top 3 most frequently detected genotypes were HPV52, HPV58, and HPV16. Among 185 participants in the microbiology study, the β diversity of the HC group was significantly different from HPV-positive groups (

This study displayed that HPV52, HPV58, and HPV16 were the most prevalent high-risk variants in south China. In addition, high-risk HPV infection was featured by
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus iners</jats:italic>
              , while low-risk HPV infection was by
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</jats:italic>
              . Further sub-group analysis showed that
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</jats:italic>
              was significantly reduced in patients with cervical lesions. Finally, CST clustering showed that CST IV was the most common type in HC group, while CST I accounted the most in H group. In a word, this study for the first time systemically profiled vaginal microbiome of different HPV infections, which may add bricks to current knowledge on HPV infection and lay the foundation for novel treatment/prevention development.

            Group A streptococcal (GAS) strains causing severe, invasive infections often have mutations in the control of virulence two-component regulatory system (CovRS) which represses capsule production, and high-level capsule production is considered critical to the GAS hypervirulent phenotype. Additionally, based on studies in
            <jats:italic>emm1</jats:italic>
            GAS, hyperencapsulation is thought to limit transmission of CovRS-mutated strains by reducing GAS adherence to mucosal surfaces. It has recently been identified that about 30% of invasive GAS strains lacks capsule, but there are limited data regarding the impact of CovS inactivation in such acapsular strains. Using publicly available complete genomes (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>

These data suggest that the hypervirulence induced by CovS inactivation in acapsular GAS follows distinct pathways from the better studied encapsulated strains and that factors other than hyperencapsulation may account for the lack of transmission of CovRS-mutated strains.

              Devastating infections due to group A streptococci (GAS) tend to occur sporadically and are often caused by strains that contain mutations in the control of virulence regulatory system (CovRS). In well-studied
              <jats:italic>emm1</jats:italic>
              GAS, the increased production of capsule induced by CovRS mutation is considered key to both hypervirulence and limited transmissibility by interfering with proteins that mediate attachment to eukaryotic cells. Herein, we show that the rates of covRS mutations and genetic clustering of CovRS-mutated isolates are independent of capsule status. Moreover, we found that CovS inactivation in multiple acapsular GAS
              <jats:italic>emm</jats:italic>
              types results in dramatically altered transcript levels of a diverse array of cell-surface protein-encoding genes and a unique transcriptome relative to encapsulated GAS. These data provide new insights into how a major human pathogen achieves hypervirulence and indicate that factors other than hyperencapsulation likely account for the sporadic nature of the severe GAS disease.

            Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, especially butyric acid) have been demonstrated to play a promising role in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recently, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is also suggested to increase the risk of ASD. However, the mechanism underlying SCFAs and HPA axis in ASD development remains unknown. Here, we show that children with ASD exhibited lower SCFA concentrations and higher cortisol levels, which were recaptured in prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-exposed rat model of ASD. These offspring also showed decreased SCFA-producing bacteria and histone acetylation activity as well as impaired corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) expression. Sodium butyrate (NaB), which can act as histone deacetylases inhibitors, significantly increased histone acetylation at the CRHR2 promoter
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and normalized the corticosterone as well as CRHR2 expression level
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Behavioral assays indicated ameliorative effects of NaB on anxiety and social deficit in LPS-exposed offspring. Our results imply that NaB treatment can improve ASD-like symptoms via epigenetic regulation of the HPA axis in offspring; thus, it may provide new insight into the SCFA treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.

              Growing evidence suggests that microbiota can affect brain function and behavior through the “microbiome–gut–brain’’ axis, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that both children with autism and LPS-exposed rat model of autism exhibited lower SCFA concentrations and overactivation of HPA axis. SCFA-producing bacteria,
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus</jats:italic>
              , might be the key differential microbiota between the control and LPS-exposed offspring. Interestingly, NaB treatment contributed to the regulation of HPA axis (such as corticosterone as well as CRHR2) and improvement of anxiety and social deficit behaviors in LPS-exposed offspring. The potential underlying mechanism of the ameliorative effect of NaB may be mediated via increasing histone acetylation to the CRHR2 promoter. These results enhance our understanding of the relationship between the SCFAs and the HPA axis in the development of ASD. And gut microbiota-derived SCFAs may serve as a potential therapeutic agent to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.

              Biological nitrogen (N) fixation, an important pathway of N, inputs from the atmosphere to Earth’s ecosystems, is well demonstrated to decline under N input. However, it remains unclear why N fixers sustain N fixation in many forests under high atmospheric N deposition. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the response of the diazotroph community to low N loads (short-term and low N addition; 3-year N addition at the rates of 25–50 kg N ha

Richness and alpha diversity (ACE and Chao1) of the soil diazotroph community decreased under low but not high N loads. Approximately 67.1%–74.4% of the

              This study examined the changes in soil diazotroph community under different loads of simulated N deposition and analyzed its relationship with N fixation rates in in five forests using high-throughput sequencing. The magnitudes of N fixation rates reduced by low N loads were higher than those by high N loads. Low N loads decreased richness and diversity of diazotroph community, whereas diazotroph community structure remained stable under high N loads. Compared with low N loads, high N loads resulted in a less similarity and overlap of
              <jats:italic>nifH</jats:italic>
              gene sequences among the treatments and a larger adjustment of diazotroph community. Low N loads increased soil NH4+ concentrations, which decreased diazotroph community richness, diversity, and N fixation rates, whereas the increased soil NH4+ under high N loads did not have negative impacts on diazotroph community structure and N fixation. Based on these findings, it is urgently needed to incorporate the loads of N deposition and the composition of diazotroph community into terrestrial N-cycling models for accurate understanding of N inputs in forest ecosystems.

While planktonic and benthic microbes are well-studied, host-associated microbes likely play an important role in mitigating the negative impacts of aquatic pollution and represent an unrealized source of microbial potential. For example, aquatic organisms that thrive in highly polluted environments or concentrate pollutants may have microbiomes adapted to these selective pressures. Understanding microbe–pollutant interactions in sensitive and valuable species could help protect human well-being and improve ecosystem resilience. Investigating these interactions using appropriate experimental systems and overcoming methodological challenges will present novel opportunities to protect and improve aquatic systems.

          <jats:p>
            The intra-host composition of horizontally transmitted microbial symbionts can vary across host populations due to interactive effects of host genetics, environmental, and geographic factors. While adaptation to local habitat conditions can drive geographic subdivision of symbiont strains, it is unknown how differences in ecological characteristics among host-symbiont associations influence the genomic structure of symbiont populations. To address this question, we sequenced metagenomes of different populations of the deep-sea mussel
            <jats:italic>Bathymodiolus septemdierum</jats:italic>
            , which are common at Western Pacific deep-sea hydrothermal vents and show characteristic patterns of niche partitioning with sympatric gastropod symbioses.
            <jats:italic>Bathymodiolus septemdierum</jats:italic>
            lives in close symbiotic relationship with sulfur-oxidizing chemosynthetic bacteria but supplements its symbiotrophic diet through filter-feeding, enabling it to occupy ecological niches with little exposure to geochemical reductants. Our analyses indicate that symbiont populations associated with
            <jats:italic>B. septemdierum</jats:italic>
            show structuring by geographic location, but that the dominant symbiont strain is uncorrelated with vent site. These patterns are in contrast to co-occurring

            and
            <jats:italic>Ifremeria</jats:italic>
            gastropod symbioses that exhibit greater symbiont nutritional dependence and occupy habitats with higher spatial variability in environmental conditions. Our results suggest that relative habitat homogeneity combined with sufficient symbiont dispersal and genomic mixing might promote persistence of similar symbiont strains across geographic locations, while mixotrophy might decrease selective pressures on the host to affiliate with locally adapted symbiont strains. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of the potential mechanisms influencing symbiont population structure across a spectrum of marine microbial symbioses that occupy contrasting ecological niches.

            <jats:p>Beneficial relationships between animals and microbial organisms (symbionts) are ubiquitous in nature. In the ocean, microbial symbionts are typically acquired from the environment and their composition across geographic locations is often shaped by adaptation to local habitat conditions. However, it is currently unknown how generalizable these patterns are across symbiotic systems that have contrasting ecological characteristics. To address this question, we compared symbiont population structure between deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels and co-occurring but ecologically distinct snail species. Our analyses show that mussel symbiont populations are less partitioned by geography and do not demonstrate evidence for environmental adaptation. We posit that the mussel's mixotrophic feeding mode may lower its need to affiliate with locally adapted symbiont strains, while microhabitat stability and symbiont genomic mixing likely favors persistence of symbiont strains across geographic locations. Altogether, these findings further our understanding of the mechanisms shaping symbiont population structure in marine environmentally transmitted symbioses.</jats:p>

Here, we aim to identify gut and oral microbiome markers that predict COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients, specifically severely ill patients compared to moderately ill ones. Moreover, we investigate whether hospital feeding (solid versus enteral), an important cofounder, influences the microbial composition of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We used random forest classification machine learning models with interpretable secondary analyses. The gut, but not the oral microbiota, was a robust predictor of both COVID-19-related fatality and severity of hospitalized patients, with a higher predictive value than most clinical variables.

We reconstructed the metabolic network of each strain from its genome sequence and looked for the metabolic pathways differentiating the different reconstructed networks and, by extension, the different strains. Finally, we conducted an experimental validation by determining the metabolic profile of each strain with the Biolog technology. Results revealed that the metabolism is conserved between strains, with a core metabolism composed of 82% of the pan-reactome. The three species composing the species complex could be distinguished according to the presence/absence of some metabolic pathways, in particular, one involving salicylic acid degradation. Phenotypic assays revealed that the trophic preferences on organic acids and several amino acids such as glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine are conserved between strains. Finally, we generated mutants lacking the quorum-sensing-dependent regulator PhcA in four diverse strains, and we showed that the

None of the published genomic comparative studies have focused on the metabolism of the strains so far. We developed a new bioinformatic pipeline to build high-quality metabolic networks and used a combination of metabolic modeling and high-throughput phenotypic Biolog microplates to look for the metabolic differences between 11 strains across the three species. Our study revealed that genes encoding enzymes are overall conserved, with few variations between strains. However, more variations were observed when considering substrate usage. These variations probably result from regulation rather than the presence or absence of enzymes in the genome.

          <jats:p>A deep understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–host interactions is crucial to developing effective therapeutics and addressing the threat of emerging coronaviruses. The role of noncoding regions of viral RNA (ncrRNAs) has yet to be systematically scrutinized. We developed a method using MS2 affinity purification coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and designed a diverse set of bait ncrRNAs to systematically map the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 ncrRNA in Calu-3, Huh7, and HEK293T cells. Integration of the results defined the core ncrRNA–host protein interactomes among cell lines. The 5′ UTR interactome is enriched with proteins in the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins family and is a target for the regulation of viral replication and transcription. The 3′ UTR interactome is enriched with proteins involved in the stress granules and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins family. Intriguingly, compared with the positive-sense ncrRNAs, the negative-sense ncrRNAs, especially the negative-sense of 3′ UTR, interacted with a large array of host proteins across all cell lines. These proteins are involved in the regulation of the viral production process, host cell apoptosis, and immune response. Taken together, our study depicts the comprehensive landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 ncrRNA–host protein interactome and unveils the potential regulatory role of the negative-sense ncrRNAs, providing a new perspective on virus–host interactions and the design of future therapeutics. Given the highly conserved nature of UTRs in positive-strand viruses, the regulatory role of negative-sense ncrRNAs should not be exclusive to SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>

            Contamination of hospital sinks with microbial pathogens presents a serious potential threat to patients, but our understanding of sink colonization dynamics is largely based on infection outbreaks. Here, we investigate the colonization patterns of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in intensive care unit sinks and water from two hospitals in the USA and Pakistan collected over 27 months of prospective sampling. Using culture-based methods, we recovered 822 bacterial isolates representing 104 unique species and genomospecies. Genomic analyses revealed long-term colonization by
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>
            spp. and
            <jats:italic>Serratia marcescens</jats:italic>
            strains across multiple rooms. Nanopore sequencing uncovered examples of long-term persistence of resistance-conferring plasmids in unrelated hosts. These data indicate that antibiotic resistance (AR) in
            <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic>
            spp. is maintained both by strain colonization and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), while HGT maintains AR within
            <jats:italic>Acinetobacter</jats:italic>
            spp. and Enterobacterales, independent of colonization. These results emphasize the importance of proactive, genomic-focused surveillance of built environments to mitigate MDRO spread.

            <jats:p>Hospital sinks are frequently linked to outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track the long-term colonization patterns in intensive care unit (ICU) sinks and water from two hospitals in the USA and Pakistan collected over 27 months of prospective sampling. We analyzed 822 bacterial genomes, representing over 100 different species. We identified long-term contamination by opportunistic pathogens, as well as transient appearance of other common pathogens. We found that bacteria recovered from the ICU had more antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in their genomes compared to matched community spaces. We also found that many of these ARGs are harbored on mobilizable plasmids, which were found shared in the genomes of unrelated bacteria. Overall, this study provides an in-depth view of contamination patterns for common nosocomial pathogens and identifies specific targets for surveillance.</jats:p>

              The development of synthetic microbial consortia in recent years has revealed that complex interspecies interactions, notably the exchange of cytoplasmic material, exist even among organisms that originate from different ecological niches. Although morphogenetic characteristics, viable RNA and protein dyes, and fluorescent reporter proteins have played an essential role in exploring such interactions, we hypothesized that ribosomal RNA-fluorescence
              <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>
              hybridization (rRNA-FISH) could be adapted and applied to further investigate interactions in synthetic or semisynthetic consortia. Despite its maturity, several challenges exist in using rRNA-FISH as a tool to quantify individual species population dynamics and interspecies interactions using high-throughput instrumentation such as flow cytometry. In this work, we resolve such challenges and apply rRNA-FISH to double and triple co-cultures of
              <jats:italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium ljungdahlii,</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Clostridium kluyveri</jats:italic>
              . In pursuing our goal to capture each organism’s population dynamics, we demonstrate dynamic rRNA, and thus ribosome, exchange between the three species leading to the formation of hybrid cells. We also characterize the localization patterns of the translation machinery in the three species, identifying distinct, dynamic localization patterns among them. Our data also support the use of rRNA-FISH to assess the culture’s health and expansion potential, and, here again, our data find surprising differences among the three species examined. Taken together, our study argues for rRNA-FISH as a valuable and accessible tool for quantitative exploration of interspecies interactions, especially in organisms which cannot be genetically engineered or in consortia where selective pressures to maintain recombinant species cannot be used.

            There are gaps in our understandings on how did the evolutionary relationships among members of the phytobiomes shape their ability to produce tremendously complex specialized metabolites under the influence of plant host. To determine these relationships, we investigated the phylogenetic conservation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) on a global collection of 4,519 high-quality and nonredundant (out of 12,181) bacterial isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 different plant hosts and soil, by adopting three independent phylogenomic approaches (

            -test, Pagel’s λ, and consenTRAIT). We report that the BGCs are phylogenetically conserved to varying strengths and depths in their different classes. We show that the ability to produce specialized metabolites qualifies as a complex trait, and the depth of conservation is equivalent to ecologically relevant complex microbial traits. Interestingly, terpene and aryl polyene BGCs had the strongest phylogenetic conservation in the phytobiomes, but not in the soil microbiomes. Furthermore, we showed that terpenes are largely uncharacterized in phytobiomes and pinpointed specific clades that harbor potentially novel terpenes. Taken together, this study sheds light on the evolution of specialized metabolites’ biosynthesis potential in phytobiomes under the influence of plant hosts and presents strategies to rationally guide the discovery of potentially novel classes of metabolites.

              Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a severe inflammatory response that can lead to organ dysfunction and death. Modulating the gut microbiome is a promising therapeutic approach for managing SIRS. This study assesses the therapeutic potential of the Xuanfei Baidu (XFBD) formula in treating SIRS. The results showed that XFBD administration effectively reduced mortality rates and inflammation in SIRS mice. Using 16S rRNA sequencing and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), we substantiated that the therapeutic effects of XFBD are partly attributed to gut microbiota modulation. We conducted
              <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
              experiments to accurately assess the gut microbiome remodeling effects of 51 compounds isolated from XFBD. These compounds exhibited varying abilities to induce a microbial structure that closely resembles that of the healthy control group. By quantifying their impact on microbial structure and clustering their regulatory patterns, we devised multiple gut microbiome remodeling compound (GMRC) cocktails. GMRC cocktail C, comprising aucubin, gentiopicroside, syringic acid, gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, para-hydroxybenzoic acid, and isoimperatorin, demonstrated superior efficacy in treating SIRS compared to a single compound or to other cocktails. Finally,

            evolution experiments at sub-lethal concentrations of the antibiotic. All four cefiderocol-resistant strains obtained harbored mutations in two-component system BaeS-BaeR. When we engineered the mutations of BaeS (D89V) and BaeR (S104N) into the genome of ATCC 17978, these mutations increased cefiderocol minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by 8-fold to 16-fold. Transcriptome analyses showed that the expression of MacAB-TolC and MFS transporters was up-regulated in BaeSR mutants. Strains over-expressing MFS transporter and MacAB-TolC displayed higher MICs and higher median inhibition concentration (IC

Moreover, bacteria should recognize and react to environmental signals quickly in host cells. Two-component system (TCS) is an important way for bacteria to perceive external environmental signals and transmit them to the interior to trigger the associated regulatory mechanism.

            Biotic factors that influence the temporal stability of microbial community
                    functioning are an emerging research focus for control of natural and engineered
                    systems. Discovery of common features within community ensembles that differ in
                    functional stability over time is a starting point to explore biotic factors. We
                    serially propagated a suite of soil microbial communities through five
                    generations of 28 d microcosm incubations to examine microbial community
                    compositional and functional stability during plant-litter decomposition. Using
                    DOC abundance as a target function, we hypothesized that microbial diversity,
                    compositional stability, and associated changes in interactions would explain
                    the
            <jats:italic>relative</jats:italic>
            stability of the ecosystem function between
                    generations. Communities with initially high DOC abundance tended to converge
                    towards a “low DOC” phenotype within two generations, but across all
                    microcosms, functional stability between generations was highly variable. By
                    splitting communities into two cohorts based on their relative DOC functional
                    stability, we found that compositional shifts, diversity, and interaction
                    network complexity were associated with the stability of DOC abundance between
                    generations. Further, our results showed that legacy effects were important in
                    determining compositional and functional outcomes, and we identified taxa
                    associated with high DOC abundance. In the context of litter decomposition,
                    achieving functionally stable communities is required to utilize soil
                    microbiomes to increase DOC abundance and long-term terrestrial DOC
                    sequestration as 1 solution to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
                    Identifying factors that stabilize function for a community of interest may
                    improve the success of microbiome engineering applications.

            Bacteriophages, viruses that parasitize bacteria, are known to be abundant at sites of bacterial colonization, but the relationship between phages and bacteria at sites of infection is unclear. Bacteriophages are highly specific to their bacterial host species, and so we hypothesize that phage populations would mirror those of bacterial pathogens within infected tissues. To test this, here we study publicly available cell-free DNA (cfDNA) generated using next-generation sequencing of infected bodily fluids, including urine, joint fluid, peritoneal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and abscess fluid, as well as uninfected control samples. These were analyzed using a computational pipeline for identifying bacteriophage sequences in cfDNA. We find that bacteriophage sequences are present in both infected and uninfected bodily fluids and represent a variety of bacteriophage morphologies and bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages from
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            ,

These data indicate that phages reflect the relative abundance of their bacterial hosts at sites of infection. Bacteriophage sequences may help inform future investigative and diagnostic approaches that utilize cell-free DNA to study the microbiome within infected tissues.

However, its physiology and ecological roles are completely unknown since, to date, not a single PAUC43f isolate or metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) has been characterized.

This group was detected in 4,965 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets, mainly from marine sediments, sponges, corals, soils, and lakes, reaching up to 34.3% relative abundance, which highlights its cosmopolitan character, mainly salt-related. The potential metabolic capabilities inferred from 52

          <jats:p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and metabarcoding approaches are increasingly applied to wild animal populations, but there is a disconnect between the widely applied generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approaches commonly used to study phenotypic variation and the statistical toolkit from community ecology typically applied to metabarcoding data. Here, we describe the suitability of a novel GLMM-based approach for analyzing the taxon-specific sequence read counts derived from standard metabarcoding data. This approach allows decomposition of the contribution of different drivers to variation in community composition (e.g., age, season, individual) via interaction terms in the model random-effects structure. We provide guidance to implementing this approach and show how these models can identify how responsible specific taxonomic groups are for the effects attributed to different drivers. We applied this approach to two cross-sectional data sets from the Soay sheep population of St. Kilda. GLMMs showed agreement with dissimilarity-based approaches highlighting the substantial contribution of age and minimal contribution of season to microbiota community compositions, and simultaneously estimated the contribution of other technical and biological factors. We further used model predictions to show that age effects were principally due to increases in taxa of the phylum Bacteroidetes and declines in taxa of the phylum Firmicutes. This approach offers a powerful means for understanding the influence of drivers of community structure derived from metabarcoding data. We discuss how our approach could be readily adapted to allow researchers to estimate contributions of additional factors such as host or microbe phylogeny to answer emerging questions surrounding the ecological and evolutionary roles of within-host communities.</jats:p>

Associated positions (exact

Cliques of different sizes represented theoretical combinations of changing residues in sequence space, allowing the identification of significant aminoacidic combinations in single sequences of real-world populations. Our analytic approach that links network structural aspects to mutational aminoacidic combinations in the spike sequence population offers a novel way to understand virus epidemiology and evolution.

            Stable isotope probing (SIP) facilitates culture-independent identification of active microbial populations within complex ecosystems through isotopic enrichment of nucleic acids. Many DNA-SIP studies rely on 16S rRNA gene sequences to identify active taxa, but connecting these sequences to specific bacterial genomes is often challenging. Here, we describe a standardized laboratory and analysis framework to quantify isotopic enrichment on a per-genome basis using shotgun metagenomics instead of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To develop this framework, we explored various sample processing and analysis approaches using a designed microbiome where the identity of labeled genomes and their level of isotopic enrichment were experimentally controlled. With this ground truth dataset, we empirically assessed the accuracy of different analytical models for identifying active taxa and examined how sequencing depth impacts the detection of isotopically labeled genomes. We also demonstrate that using synthetic DNA internal standards to measure absolute genome abundances in SIP density fractions improves estimates of isotopic enrichment. In addition, our study illustrates the utility of internal standards to reveal anomalies in sample handling that could negatively impact SIP metagenomic analyses if left undetected. Finally, we present
            <jats:italic>SIPmg</jats:italic>
            , an R package to facilitate the estimation of absolute abundances and perform statistical analyses for identifying labeled genomes within SIP metagenomic data. This experimentally validated analysis framework strengthens the foundation of DNA-SIP metagenomics as a tool for accurately measuring the

              within complex microbial communities is paramount for our ability to model, predict, and modulate microbiomes for improved human and planetary health. These questions can be pursued using stable isotope probing to track the incorporation of labeled compounds into cellular DNA during microbial growth. However, with traditional stable isotope methods, it is challenging to establish links between an active microorganism’s taxonomic identity and genome composition while providing quantitative estimates of the microorganism’s isotope incorporation rate. Here, we report an experimental and analytical workflow that lays the foundation for improved detection of metabolically active microorganisms and better quantitative estimates of genome-resolved isotope incorporation, which can be used to further refine ecosystem-scale models for carbon and nutrient fluxes within microbiomes.

          <jats:p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a large, oncogenic DNA virus belonging to the gammaherpesvirus subfamily. KSHV has been extensively studied with various high-throughput RNA-sequencing approaches to map the transcription start and end sites, the splice junctions, and the translation initiation sites. Despite these efforts, the comprehensive annotation of the viral transcriptome remains incomplete. In the present study, we generated a long-read sequencing data set of the lytic and latent KSHV transcriptome using native RNA and direct cDNA-sequencing methods. This was supplemented with Cap Analysis of Gene Expression sequencing based on a short-read platform. We also utilized data sets from previous publications for our analysis. As a result of this combined approach, we have identified a number of novel viral transcripts and RNA isoforms and have either corroborated or improved the annotation of previously identified viral RNA molecules, thereby notably enhancing our comprehension of the transcriptomic architecture of the KSHV genome. We also evaluated the coding capability of transcripts previously thought to be non-coding by integrating our data on the viral transcripts with translatomic information from other publications.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>A key challenge in the analysis of microbiome data is the integration of multi-omic datasets and the discovery of interactions between microbial taxa, their expressed genes, and the metabolites they consume and/or produce. In an effort to improve the state of the art in inferring biologically meaningful multi-omic interactions, we sought to address some of the most fundamental issues in causal inference from longitudinal multi-omics microbiome data sets. We developed METALICA, a suite of tools and techniques that can infer interactions between microbiome entities. METALICA introduces novel unrolling and de-confounding techniques used to uncover multi-omic entities that are believed to act as confounders for some of the relationships that may be inferred using standard causal inferencing tools. The results lend support to predictions about biological models and processes by which microbial taxa interact with each other in a microbiome. The unrolling process helps identify putative intermediaries (genes and/or metabolites) to explain the interactions between microbes; the de-confounding process identifies putative common causes that may lead to spurious relationships to be inferred. METALICA was applied to the networks inferred by existing causal discovery, and network inference algorithms were applied to a multi-omics data set resulting from a longitudinal study of IBD microbiomes. The most significant unrollings and de-confoundings were manually validated using the existing literature and databases.</jats:p>

METALICA introduces novel techniques called unrolling and de-confounding that are employed to uncover multi-omic entities considered to be confounders for some of the relationships that may be inferred using standard causal inferencing tools. To evaluate our method, we conducted tests on the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dataset from the iHMP longitudinal study, which we pre-processed in accordance with our previous work. From this dataset, we generated various subsets, encompassing different combinations of metagenomics, metabolomics, and metatranscriptomics datasets. Using these multi-omics datasets, we demonstrate how the unrolling process aids in the identification of putative intermediaries (genes and/or metabolites) to explain the interactions between microbes. Additionally, the de-confounding process identifies potential common causes that may give rise to spurious relationships to be inferred.

              Gut microbiome plays a vital role in the intestinal ecosystem and has close association with metabolites. Due to the development of metabolomics and microbiomics, recent studies have observed that alteration of either the gut microbiome or metabolites may have effects on the progression of pancreatitis. Several new treatments based on the gut microbiome or metabolites have been studied extensively in recent years. Gut microbes, such as

              , and metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, vitamin, hydrogen sulfide, and alcohol, have different effects on pancreatitis. Some preliminary studies about new intervention measures were based on the gut microbiome and metabolites such as diet, prebiotic, herbal medicine, and fecal microbiota transplantation. This review aims to summarize the recent advances about the gut microbiome, metabolites, and pancreatitis in order to determine the potential beneficial role of the gut microbiome and metabolites in pancreatitis.

            Microbial necromass contributes significantly to both soil carbon (C) persistence and ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability, but quantitative estimates of C and N movement from necromass into soils and decomposer communities are lacking. Additionally, while melanin is known to slow fungal necromass decomposition, how it influences microbial C and N acquisition as well as elemental release into soils remains unclear. Here, we tracked decomposition of isotopically labeled low and high melanin fungal necromass and measured
            <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>
            C and
            <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>
            N accumulation in surrounding soils and microbial communities over 77 d in a temperate forest in Minnesota, USA. Mass loss was significantly higher from low melanin necromass, corresponding with greater
            <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>
            C and
            <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>

            <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>
            C and/or
            <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>
            N at all sampling points, with enrichment being consistently higher on low melanin necromass and earlier in decomposition. Similar patterns of preferential C and N enrichment of many bacterial and fungal genera early in decomposition suggest that both microbial groups co-contribute to the rapid assimilation of resource-rich soil organic matter inputs. While overall richness of taxa enriched in C was higher than in N for both bacteria and fungi, there was a significant positive relationship between C and N in co-enriched taxa. Collectively, our results demonstrate that melanization acts as a key ecological trait mediating not only fungal necromass decomposition rate but also necromass C and N release and that both elements are rapidly co-utilized by diverse bacterial and fungal decomposers in natural settings.

            <jats:p>Recent studies indicate that microbial dead cells, particularly those of fungi, play an important role in long-term carbon persistence in soils. Despite this growing recognition, how the resources within dead fungal cells (also known as fungal necromass) move into decomposer communities and soils are poorly quantified, particularly in studies based in natural environments. In this study, we found that the contribution of fungal necromass to soil carbon and nitrogen availability was slowed by the amount of melanin present in fungal cell walls. Further, despite the overall rapid acquisition of carbon and nitrogen from necromass by a diverse range of both bacteria and fungi, melanization also slowed microbial uptake of both elements. Collectively, our results indicate that melanization acts as a key ecological trait mediating not only fungal necromass decomposition rate, but also necromass carbon and nitrogen release into soil as well as microbial resource acquisition.</jats:p>

In biofilms, genetically identical cells often exhibit heterogeneous transcriptional phenotypes, so that subpopulations of cells carry out essential yet costly cellular processes that allow the entire population to thrive. Surprisingly, the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity and the relationships between subpopulations of cells within biofilms of even in well-studied bacterial systems like
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            remains largely unknown. To determine relationships between these subpopulations of cells, we created 182 strains containing pairwise combinations of fluorescent transcriptional reporters for the expression state of 14 different genes associated with potential cellular subpopulations. We determined the spatial organization of the expression of these genes within biofilms using confocal microscopy, which revealed that many reporters localized to distinct areas of the biofilm, some of which were co-localized. We used flow cytometry to quantify reporter co-expression, which revealed that many cells “multi-task,” simultaneously expressing two reporters. These data indicate that prior models describing
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            cells as differentiating into specific cell types, each with a specific task or function, were oversimplified. Only a few subpopulations of cells, including surfactin and plipastatin producers, as well as sporulating and competent cells, appear to have distinct roles based on the set of genes examined here. These data will provide us with a framework with which to further study and make predictions about the roles of diverse cellular phenotypes in

              Many microbes differentiate, expressing diverse phenotypes to ensure their survival in various environments. However, studies on phenotypic differentiation have typically examined only a few phenotypes at one time, thus limiting our knowledge about the extent of differentiation and phenotypic overlap in the population. We investigated the spatial organization and gene expression relationships for genes important in
              <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
              biofilms. In doing so, we mapped spatial gene expression patterns and expanded the number of cell populations described in the
              <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
              literature. It is likely that other bacteria also display complex differentiation patterns within their biofilms. Studying the extent of cellular differentiation in other microbes may be important when designing therapies for disease-causing bacteria, where studying only a single phenotype may be masking underlying phenotypic differentiation relevant to infection outcomes.

            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>
            comprises two species,
            <jats:italic>Salmonella bongori</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>S. enterica</jats:italic>
            has been further partitioned into 6–10 subspecies based on such features as host range, geography, and most recently, genetic relatedness and phylogenetic affiliation. Although
            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>
            pathogenicity is attributable to large numbers of acquired virulence factors, the extent of homologous exchange in the species at large is apparently constrained such that the species and subspecies form distinct clusters of strains. To explore the extent of gene flow within and among subspecies, and to ultimately define true biological species, we evaluated patterns of recombination in over 1,000 genomes currently assigned to the genus. Those
            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>
            subspecies will also represent a biological species. Our findings argue against the application of prescribed nucleotide-identity thresholds to delineate bacterial species and contend that the Biological Species Concept should not be disregarded for bacteria, even those, like
            <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>

            <jats:p>
              The Biological Species Concept (BSC), which defines species boundaries based on the capacity for gene exchange, is widely used to classify sexually reproducing eukaryotes but is generally thought to be inapplicable to bacteria due to their completely asexual mode of reproduction. We show that the genus
              <jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>
              , whose thousands of described serovars were formerly considered to be strictly clonal, undergoes sufficient levels of homologous recombination to be assigned to species according to the BSC. Aside from the two recognized species,
              <jats:italic>Salmonella enterica</jats:italic>
              and
              <jats:italic>Salmonella bongori</jats:italic>
              , several (and likely all) of the subspecies within
              <jats:italic>S. enterica</jats:italic>
              are reproductively isolated from one another and should each be considered a separate biological species. These findings demonstrate that species barriers in bacteria can form despite high levels of nucleotide identity and that commonly applied thresholds of genomic sequence identity are not reliable indicators of bacterial species status.

            The ability of bacterial pathogens to metabolically adapt to the environmental conditions of their hosts is critical to both colonization and invasive disease. Infection with
            <jats:italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</jats:italic>
            (the gonococcus, Gc) is characterized by the influx of neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)], which fail to clear the bacteria and make antimicrobial products that can exacerbate tissue damage. The inability of the human host to clear Gc infection is particularly concerning in light of the emergence of strains that are resistant to all clinically recommended antibiotics. Bacterial metabolism represents a promising target for the development of new therapeutics against Gc. Here, we generated a curated genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) of Gc strain FA1090. This GENRE links genetic information to metabolic phenotypes and predicts Gc biomass synthesis and energy consumption. We validated this model with published data and in new results reported here. Contextualization of this model using the transcriptional profile of Gc exposed to PMNs revealed substantial rearrangements of Gc central metabolism and induction of Gc nutrient acquisition strategies for alternate carbon source use. These features enhanced the growth of Gc in the presence of neutrophils. From these results, we conclude that the metabolic interplay between Gc and PMNs helps define infection outcomes. The use of transcriptional profiling and metabolic modeling to reveal new mechanisms by which Gc persists in the presence of PMNs uncovers unique aspects of metabolism in this fastidious bacterium, which could be targeted to block infection and thereby reduce the burden of gonorrhea in the human population.

            <jats:p>The World Health Organization designated Gc as a high-priority pathogen for research and development of new antimicrobials. Bacterial metabolism is a promising target for new antimicrobials, as metabolic enzymes are widely conserved among bacterial strains and are critical for nutrient acquisition and survival within the human host. Here we used genome-scale metabolic modeling to characterize the core metabolic pathways of this fastidious bacterium and to uncover the pathways used by Gc during culture with primary human immune cells. These analyses revealed that Gc relies on different metabolic pathways during co-culture with human neutrophils than in rich media. Conditionally essential genes emerging from these analyses were validated experimentally. These results show that metabolic adaptation in the context of innate immunity is important to Gc pathogenesis. Identifying the metabolic pathways used by Gc during infection can highlight new therapeutic targets for drug-resistant gonorrhea.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>
            Regular high-intensity exercise can cause changes in athletes’ gut microbiota, and the extent and nature of these changes may be affected by the athletes’ exercise patterns. However, it is still unclear to what extent different types of athletes have distinct gut microbiome profiles and whether we can effectively monitor an athlete’s inflammatory risk based on their microbiota. To address these questions, we conducted a multi-cohort study of 543 fecal samples from athletes in three different sports: aerobics (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 316), wrestling (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 53), and rowing (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 174). We sought to investigate how athletes’ gut microbiota was specialized for different types of sports, and its associations with inflammation, diet, anthropometrics, and anaerobic measurements. We established a microbiota catalog of multi-cohort athletes and found that athletes have specialized gut microbiota specific to the type of sport they engaged in. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, we identified 10 microbial subgroups of athletes’ gut microbiota, each of which had specific correlations with inflammation, diet, and anaerobic performance in different types of athletes. Notably, most inflammation indicators were associated with
            <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>
            -driven subgroup 7. Finally, we found that the effects of sport types and exercise intensity on the gut microbiota were sex-dependent. These findings shed light on the complex associations between physical factors, gut microbiota, and inflammation in athletes of different sports types and could have significant implications for monitoring potential inflammation risk and developing personalized exercise programs.

Our findings highlight that athletes’ gut microbiota is sport-specific, indicating that exercise patterns may play a significant role in shaping the microbiome. Additionally, we observed distinct associations between gut microbiota and markers of inflammation, diet, and anaerobic performance in athletes of different sports. Moreover, we expanded our analysis to include a non-athlete cohort and found that exercise intensity had varying effects on the gut microbiota of participants, depending on sex.</jats:p>

We discovered that simple and efficient models based entirely on genomic sequence content—e.g., triplets of amino acids—perform as well as intensive annotation-based classifiers, enabling rapid processing of genomes. We further show that amino acid trimers are useful because they encode information about protein composition and phylogeny. To showcase the utility of rapid prediction, we estimated the prevalence of aerobes and anaerobes in diverse natural environments cataloged in the Earth Microbiome Project. Focusing on a well-studied O

As an example of this broader principle, we developed algorithms that accurately predict microbial dioxygen utilization directly from genome sequences without annotating genes, e.g., by considering only the amino acids in protein sequences. Annotation-free algorithms enable rapid characterization of natural samples, highlighting quantitative correspondence between sequences and local O

            <jats:p>In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), complex microbial communities process diverse chemical compounds from sewage. Secreted proteins are critical because many are the first to interact with or degrade external (macro)molecules. To better understand microbial functions in WWTPs, we predicted secreted proteomes of WWTP microbiota from more than 1,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 23 Danish WWTPs with biological nutrient removal. Focus was placed on examining secreted catabolic exoenzymes that target major classes of macromolecules. We demonstrate that Bacteroidota has a high potential to digest complex polysaccharides, but also proteins and nucleic acids. Poorly understood activated sludge members of Acidobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota also have high capacities for extracellular polysaccharide digestion. Secreted nucleases are encoded by 61% of MAGs indicating an importance for extracellular DNA and/or RNA digestion in WWTPs. Secreted lipases were the least common macromolecule-targeting enzymes predicted, encoded mainly by Gammaproteobacteria and Myxococcota. In contrast, diverse taxa encode extracellular peptidases, indicating that proteins are widely used nutrients. Diverse secreted multi-heme cytochromes suggest capabilities for extracellular electron transfer by various taxa, including some Bacteroidota that encode undescribed cytochromes with &gt;100 heme-binding motifs. Myxococcota have exceptionally large secreted protein complements, probably related to predatory lifestyles and/or complex cell cycles. Many Gammaproteobacteria MAGs (mostly former Betaproteobacteria) encode few or no secreted hydrolases, but many periplasmic substrate-binding proteins and ABC- and TRAP-transporters, suggesting they are mostly sustained by small molecules. Together, this study provides a comprehensive overview of how WWTPs microorganisms interact with the environment, providing new insights into their functioning and niche partitioning.</jats:p>

              <jats:p>Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are critical biotechnological systems that clean wastewater, allowing the water to reenter the environment and limit eutrophication and pollution. They are also increasingly important for the recovery of resources. They function primarily by the activity of microorganisms, which act as a “living sponge,” taking up and transforming nutrients, organic material, and pollutants. Despite much research, many microorganisms in WWTPs are uncultivated and poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of their functioning. Here, we analyzed a large collection of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from WWTPs for encoded secreted enzymes and proteins, with special emphasis on those used to degrade organic material. This analysis showed highly distinct secreted proteome profiles among different major phylogenetic groups of microorganisms, thereby providing new insights into how different groups function and co-exist in activated sludge. This knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of how to efficiently manage and exploit WWTP microbiomes.</jats:p>

              Infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria are a global health threat. Bacteriophages (“phage”) are increasingly used as alternative or last-resort therapeutics to treat patients infected by MDR bacteria. However, the therapeutic outcomes of phage therapy may be limited by the emergence of phage resistance during treatment and/or by physical constraints that impede phage–bacteria interactions
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              . In this work, we evaluate the role of lung spatial structure on the efficacy of phage therapy for
              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              infections. To do so, we developed a spatially structured metapopulation network model based on the geometry of the bronchial tree, including host innate immune responses and the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants. We model the ecological interactions between bacteria, phage, and the host innate immune system at the airway (node) level. The model predicts the synergistic elimination of a
              <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              infection due to the combined effects of phage and neutrophils, given the sufficient innate immune activity and efficient phage-induced lysis. The metapopulation model simulations also predict that MDR bacteria are cleared faster at distal nodes of the bronchial tree. Notably, image analysis of lung tissue time series from wild-type and lymphocyte-depleted mice revealed a concordant, statistically significant pattern: infection intensity cleared in the bottom before the top of the lungs. Overall, the combined use of simulations and image analysis of
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>

              Phage therapy is increasingly employed as a compassionate treatment for severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. However, the mixed outcomes observed in larger clinical studies highlight a gap in understanding when phage therapy succeeds or fails. Previous research from our team, using
              <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
              experiments and single-compartment mathematical models, demonstrated the synergistic clearance of acute
              <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              pneumonia by phage and neutrophils despite the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria. In fact, the lung environment is highly structured, prompting the question of whether immunophage synergy explains the curative treatment of
              <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa</jats:italic>
              when incorporating realistic physical connectivity. To address this, we developed a metapopulation network model mimicking the lung branching structure to assess phage therapy efficacy for MDR

            The cervicovaginal microbiota is influenced by host physiology, immunology, lifestyle, and ethnicity. We hypothesized that there would be differences in the cervicovaginal microbiota among pregnant, nonpregnant, and menopausal women living in Puerto Rico (PR) with and without human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer. We specifically wanted to determine if the microbiota is associated with variations in cervical cytology. A total of 294 women, including reproductive-age nonpregnant (
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            = 196), pregnant (

            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            = 61) women, were enrolled. The cervicovaginal bacteria were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the HPV was genotyped with SPF10-LiPA, and cervical cytology was quantified. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV, 67.3%) was prevalent, including genotypes not covered by the 9vt HPV vaccine. Cervical lesions (34%) were also common. The cervical microbiota was dominated by
            <jats:italic>Lactobacillus iners</jats:italic>
            . Pregnant women in the second and third trimesters exhibited a decrease in diversity and abundance of microbes associated with bacterial vaginosis. Women in menopause had greater alpha diversity, a greater proportion of facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria, and higher cervicovaginal pH than premenopausal women. Cervical lesions were associated with greater alpha diversity. However, no significant associations between the microbiota and HPV infection (HR or LR-HPV types) were found. The cervicovaginal microbiota of women living in Puerto Rican were either dominated by
            <jats:italic>L. iners</jats:italic>
            or diverse microbial communities regardless of a woman’s physiological stage. We postulate that the microbiota and the high prevalence of HR-HPV increase the risk of cervical lesions among women living in PR.

              In the enclosed manuscript, we provide the first in-depth characterization of the cervicovaginal microbiota of Hispanic women living in Puerto Rico (PR), using a 16S rRNA approach, and include women of different physiological stages. Surprisingly we found that high-risk HPV was ubiquitous with a prevalence of 67.3%, including types not covered by the 9vt HPV vaccine. We also found highly diverse microbial communities across women groups—with a reduction in pregnant women, but dominated by nonoptimal
              <jats:italic>Lactobacillus iners</jats:italic>
              . Additionally, we found vaginosis-associated bacteria as

            Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to antibiotics to combat drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria. However, the development of AMPs with high potency and specificity remains a challenge, and new tools to evaluate antimicrobial activity are needed to accelerate the discovery process. Therefore, we proposed MBC-Attention, a combination of a multi-branch convolution neural network architecture and attention mechanisms to predict the experimental minimum inhibitory concentration of peptides against
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            . The optimal MBC-Attention model achieved an average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.775 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.533 (log μM) in three independent tests of randomly drawn sequences from the data set. This results in a 5–12% improvement in PCC and a 6–13% improvement in RMSE compared to 17 traditional machine learning models and 2 optimally tuned models using random forest and support vector machine. Ablation studies confirmed that the two proposed attention mechanisms, global attention and local attention, contributed largely to performance improvement.

              Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly increasing worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions to tackle different-to-treat bacterial infections. Tigecycline, a semi-synthesis glycylcycline for parenteral administration, is widely recognized as one of the few effective therapies available against pan-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Regrettably, the efficacy of multiple drugs, including tigecycline, is currently being undermined due to the emergence of a recently discovered mobilized resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux pump gene cluster
              <jats:italic>tmexCD1-toprJ1</jats:italic>
              . Herein, by employing untargeted metabolomic approaches, we reveal that the expression of
              <jats:italic>tmexCD1-toprJ1</jats:italic>
              disrupts bacterial purine metabolism, with inosine being identified as a crucial biomarker. Notably, the supplementation of inosine effectively reverses tigecycline resistance in
              <jats:italic>tmexCD1-toprJ1</jats:italic>
              -positive bacteria. Mechanistically, exogenous inosine enhanced bacterial proton motive force, which promotes the uptake of tigecycline. Furthermore, inosine enhances succinate biosynthesis by stimulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Succinate interacts with the two-component system EnvZ/OmpR and upregulates OmpK 36, thereby promoting the influx of tigecycline. These actions collectively lead to the increased intracellular accumulation of tigecycline. Overall, our study offers a distinct combinational strategy to manage infections caused by

              Due to recent improvements, Nanopore sequencing has become a promising method for experiments relying on amplicon sequencing. We describe a flexible workflow to generate and annotate high-quality, full-length 16S rDNA amplicons. We evaluated it for two applications, namely, (i) identification of bacterial isolates and (ii) species-level profiling of microbial communities. We assessed the identification of single bacterial isolates by sequencing, using a set of barcoded full-length 16S rRNA gene primer pairs (pair A), on 47 isolates encompassing multiple genera and compared those results with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based identification. Species-level community profiling was tested with two sets of barcoded full-length 16S primer pairs (A and B) and compared to the results obtained with shotgun Illumina sequencing using 27 stool samples. We developed a Nextflow pipeline to retain high-quality reads and taxonomically annotate them. We found high agreement between our workflow and MALDI-TOF data for isolate identification (positive predictive value = 0.90, Cramér’s
              <jats:italic>V</jats:italic>

              Children diagnosed with severe tonsillar hypertrophy display discernible craniofacial features distinct from those with adenoid hypertrophy, prompting illuminating considerations regarding microbiota regulation in this non-inflammatory condition. The present study aimed to characterize the salivary microbial profile in children with tonsillar hypertrophy and explore the potential functionality therein. A total of 112 children, with a mean age of 7.79 ± 2.41 years, were enrolled and divided into the tonsillar hypertrophy (TH) group (
              <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
              = 46, 8.4 ± 2.5 years old), adenoid hypertrophy (AH) group (

              = 22, 8.6 ± 2.1 years old). Unstimulated saliva samples were collected, and microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing of V3–V4 regions. Diversity and composition of salivary microbiome and the correlation with parameters of overnight polysomnography and complete blood count were investigated. As a result, children with tonsillar hypertrophy had significantly higher α-diversity indices (
              <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
              ＜0.05). β-diversity based on Bray–Curtis distance revealed that the salivary microbiome of the tonsillar hypertrophy group had a slight separation from the other three groups (

This study demonstrated that the salivary microbiome in pediatric tonsillar hypertrophy patients had different signatures, highlighting that the site of upper airway obstruction primarily influences the salivary microbiome rather than hypertrophy severity.

                Tonsillar hypertrophy is the most frequent cause of upper airway obstruction and one of the primary risk factors for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Studies have discovered that children with isolated tonsillar hypertrophy exhibit different craniofacial morphology features compared with those with isolated adenoid hypertrophy or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Furthermore, characteristic salivary microbiota from children with OSA compared with healthy children has been identified in our previous research. However, few studies provided insight into the relationship between the different sites of upper airway obstruction resulting from the enlargement of pharyngeal lymphoid tissue at different sites and the alterations in the microbiome. Here, to investigate the differences in the salivary microbiome of children with tonsillar hypertrophy and/or adenoid hypertrophy, we conducted a cross-sectional study and depicted the unique microbiome profile of pediatric tonsillar hypertrophy, which was mainly characterized by a significantly higher abundance of genera belonging to phyla
                <jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic>
                and certain bacteria involving in the immune response in tonsillar hypertrophy, offering novel perspectives for future related research.

              In the global efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance and reduce antimicrobial use in pig production, there is a continuous search for methods to prevent and/or treat infections. Within this scope, we explored the relationship between the developing piglet nasal microbiome and (zoonotic) bacterial pathogens from birth until 10 weeks of life. The nasal microbiome of 54 pigs was longitudinally studied over 16 timepoints on 9 farms in 3 European countries (Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands) using amplicon sequencing targeting the V3-V4 16S rRNA region as well as the
              <jats:italic>tuf</jats:italic>
              gene for its staphylococcal discrimination power. The piglets’ age, the farm, and the litter affected the nasal microbiome, with piglets’ age explaining 19% of the variation in microbial composition between samples. Stabilization of the microbiome occurred around 2 weeks post-weaning. Notably, while opportunistic pathogens were ubiquitously present, they did not cause disease. The piglet nasal microbiome often carried species associated with gut, skin, or vagina, which suggests that contact with the vaginal and fecal microbiomes shapes the piglet nasal microbiome. We identified bacterial co-abundance groups of species that were present in the nasal microbiomes in all three countries over time. Anti-correlation between these species and known bacterial pathogens identified species that might be exploited for pathogen reduction. Further experimental evidence is required to confirm these findings. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the piglet nasal microbiome, the factors influencing it, and its longitudinal development, providing insights into its role in health and disease.

            <jats:p>Our study on the nasal microbiota development in piglets across farms in three European countries found that the microbiomes developed similarly in all locations. Additionally, we observed that the colonization of porcine pathogens was either positively or negatively associated with the presence of other bacterial species.

Of all 1,992 genes analyzed, 161 and 268 were respectively over- and under-expressed with excess hemin. Notably, we detected differential DNA methylation signatures for the Dam “GATC” motif and both all-context 6mA and 5mC in response to hemin availability.

To address this, we constructed two 114-member SGMCs differing only in their quantitative composition—one reflecting the average human fecal microbiome and another mixed in equal proportions based on cell counts. We inoculated each in an automated anaerobic multi-stage
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            gut fermentor simulating two different colonic conditions, mimicking proximal and distal colons. We replicated this setup with two different nutrient media, periodically sampled the cultures for 27 days, and profiled their microbiome compositions using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. While nutrient medium explained 36% of the variance in microbiome composition, initial inoculum composition failed to show a statistically significant effect. Under all four conditions, paired fecal and equal SGMC inoculums converged to reach stable community compositions resembling each other. Our results have broad implications for simplifying

            With the concomitant advances in both the microbiome and machine learning fields, the gut microbiome has become of great interest for the potential discovery of biomarkers to be used in the classification of the host health status. Shotgun metagenomics data derived from the human microbiome is composed of a high-dimensional set of microbial features. The use of such complex data for the modeling of host-microbiome interactions remains a challenge as retaining
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            content yields a highly granular set of microbial features. In this study, we compared the prediction performances of machine learning approaches according to different types of data representations derived from shotgun metagenomics. These representations include commonly used taxonomic and functional profiles and the more granular gene cluster approach. For the five case-control datasets used in this study (Type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver cirrhosis, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease), gene-based approaches, whether used alone or in combination with reference-based data types, allowed improved or similar classification performances as the taxonomic and functional profiles. In addition, we show that using subsets of gene families from specific functional categories of genes highlight the importance of these functions on the host phenotype. This study demonstrates that both reference-free microbiome representations and curated metagenomic annotations can provide relevant representations for machine learning based on metagenomic data.

In this work, we show that different microbiome representations provide varied host phenotype classification performance depending on the dataset. In classification tasks, untargeted microbiome gene content can provide similar or improved classification compared to taxonomical profiling. Feature selection based on biological function also improves classification performance for some pathologies. Function-based feature selection combined with interpretable machine learning algorithms can generate new hypotheses that can potentially be assayed mechanistically.

          <jats:p>The interplay between the intestinal microbiota and host is critical to intestinal ontogeny and homeostasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be an underlying link. Intestinal miRNAs are microbiota-dependent and, when shed in the lumen, affect resident microorganisms. Yet, longitudinal relationships between intestinal tissue miRNAs, luminal miRNAs, and luminal microorganisms have not been elucidated, especially in early life. Here, we investigated the postnatal cecal miRNA and microbiota populations, their relationship, and their impact on intestinal maturation in specific pathogen-free mice; we also assessed if they can be modified by intervention with allochthonous probiotic lactobacilli. We report that cecal and cecal content miRNA and microbiota signatures are temporally regulated, correlated, and modifiable by probiotics with implications for intestinal maturation. These findings help understand causal relationships within the gut ecosystem and provide a basis for preventing and managing their alterations in diseases throughout life.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>The gut microbiota affects intestinal microRNA (miRNA) signatures and is modified by host-derived luminal miRNA. This suggests the existence of close miRNA-microbiota relationships that are critical to intestinal homeostasis. However, an integrative analysis of these relationships and their evolution during intestinal postnatal maturation is lacking. We provide a system-level longitudinal analysis of miRNA-microbiota networks in the intestine of mice at the weaning transition, including tissue and luminal miRNA and luminal microbiota. To address causality and move toward translational applications, we used allochthonous probiotic lactobacilli to modify these longitudinal relationships and showed that they are critical for intestinal maturation in early life. These findings contribute to understand mechanisms that underlie the maturation of the intestinal ecosystem and suggest that interventions aiming at maintaining, or restoring, homeostasis cannot prescind from considering relationships among its components.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Metaproteomics, a method for untargeted, high-throughput identification of proteins in complex samples, provides functional information about microbial communities and can tie functions to specific taxa. Metaproteomics often generates less data than other omics techniques, but analytical workflows can be improved to increase usable data in metaproteomic outputs. Identification of peptides in the metaproteomic analysis is performed by comparing mass spectra of sample peptides to a reference database of protein sequences. Although these protein databases are an integral part of the metaproteomic analysis, few studies have explored how database composition impacts peptide identification. Here, we used cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from a study of bacterial vaginosis (BV) to compare the performance of databases built using six different strategies. We evaluated broad versus sample-matched databases, as well as databases populated with proteins translated from metagenomic sequencing of the same samples versus sequences from public repositories. Smaller sample-matched databases performed significantly better, driven by the statistical constraints on large databases. Additionally, large databases attributed up to 34% of significant bacterial hits to taxa absent from the sample, as determined orthogonally by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We also tested a set of hybrid databases which included bacterial proteins from NCBI RefSeq and translated bacterial genes from the samples. These hybrid databases had the best overall performance, identifying 1,068 unique human and 1,418 unique bacterial proteins, ~30% more than a database populated with proteins from typical vaginal bacteria and fungi. Our findings can help guide the optimal identification of proteins while maintaining statistical power for reaching biological conclusions.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Metaproteomic analysis can provide valuable insights into the functions of microbial and cellular communities by identifying a broad, untargeted set of proteins. The databases used in the analysis of metaproteomic data influence results by defining what proteins can be identified. Moreover, the size of the database impacts the number of identifications after accounting for false discovery rates (FDRs). Few studies have tested the performance of different strategies for building a protein database to identify proteins from metaproteomic data and those that have largely focused on highly diverse microbial communities. We tested a range of databases on CVL samples and found that a hybrid sample-matched approach, using publicly available proteins from organisms present in the samples, as well as proteins translated from metagenomic sequencing of the samples, had the best performance. However, our results also suggest that public sequence databases will continue to improve as more bacterial genomes are published.</jats:p>

              This study provides a comprehensive assessment of how urban-rural divides influence gut microbial diversity and composition across the distinct geographical landscapes of Kazakhstan, elucidating the intricate interplay between lifestyle, environment, and gut microbiome. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 651 participants from urban centers and rural settlements across Kazakhstan, following ethical approval and informed consent. Comprehensive demographic, dietary, and stool sample data were collected. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics techniques were employed to delineate the intricate patterns of the gut microbiome. A rigorous statistical framework dissected the interplay between urbanization gradients, geography, dietary lifestyles, and microbial dynamics. Our findings demonstrate a stark microbial divide between urban and rural gut ecosystems. The study found significant differences in gut microbiome diversity and composition between urban and rural populations in Kazakhstan. Urban microbiomes exhibited reduced diversity, higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios, and increased prevalence of genera

The study also identified distinct patterns in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors between urban and rural gut microbiomes. This study sheds light on how urbanization may be deeply involved in shaping the intricate mosaic of the gut microbiome across Kazakhstan’s diverse geographical and dietary landscapes, underscoring the complex interplay between environmental exposures, dietary lifestyles, and the microbial residents inhabiting our intestines.

              The impact of a concentrate-rich (CR) diet on the gut microbiome and epithelium homeostasis is well documented. However, it has not been systematically studied whether and how host-microbial interaction contributes to the immune homeostasis in the rumen and colon of lambs fed alfalfa hay and wheat straw, alone or combined, in a CR diet. In all, 63 lambs (initial body weight, 16.69 ± 1.50 kg) were randomly allotted to three dietary groups, each consisting of three pens with seven lambs per pen. Over 14 weeks, the lambs were fed diets as follows: 60% concentrate supplemented with either 40% wheat straw (WG), 20% alfalfa hay combined with 20% wheat straw (MG), or 40% alfalfa hay (AG). The present findings showed that lambs in the AG group had greater (

The 16S rRNA analysis highlighted that various bacterial phyla and genera in the rumen and colon preferentially degrade fiber and starch derived from alfalfa hay and wheat straw. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that the bacterial genera from the
              <jats:italic>Firmicutes</jats:italic>

              as key drivers of host-microbial interactions under the present feeding conditions. These findings shed light on the fact that the rumen and colon immune homeostasis is distinctively influenced by diets of alfalfa hay, wheat straw, or their combination in a CR diet. Further studies should examine the prolonged effects of replacing wheat straw with alfalfa hay in a concentrate-rich diet formulated to provide equivalent neutral detergent fiber levels. This could reveal how various forage fibers influence host-microbial interactions and gut health.

                In contemporary feedlots, a growing trend is to feed animals a concentrate-rich (CR) diet that could disrupt the synchronized interplay between microbes and host metabolism, leading to altered metabolic functions. Wheat straw and alfalfa hay have different levels of protein and neutral detergent fiber, each with varying rates of digestion. It is unclear how including alfalfa hay and wheat straw, alone or combined in a CR diet, influences the host-microbial consortia and immune homeostasis. Herein, we showed that rumen and colon showed differential immune responses to the alfalfa hay, wheat straw, or both. Bacterial genera preferentially degrade fiber and starch derived from alfalfa hay, wheat straw, or both. Bacterial genera from

            <jats:p>The human gut microbiota possesses the capacity to synthesize vitamins, especially B group vitamins, which are recognized as indispensable for various biological processes both among members of these bacterial communities and host cells. Accordingly, vitamin production by intestinal commensals has attracted significant interest. Nevertheless, our current understanding of bacterial vitamin synthesis is primarily based on individual genomic and monoculture investigations, therefore not providing an overall view of the biosynthetic potential of complex microbial communities. In the current study, we utilized over 100 bacterial genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of B group and K vitamins to assess the corresponding vitamin biosynthetic potential of approximately 8,000 human gut microbiomes. Our analyses reveal that host-associated factors, such as age and geographical origin, appear to influence the diversity and abundance of vitamin biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, we identify gut microbiota members that substantially contribute to these biosynthetic functions at each stage of human life. Interestingly, inference of microbial co-associations and network relationships uncovered the apparent key role played by folate and cobalamin in equilibrium establishment of the infant and adult gut microbial communities, respectively.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>While research on the sourdough microbiome has primarily focused on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast, recent studies have found that acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are also common members. However, the ecology, genomic diversity, and functional contributions of AAB in sourdough remain unknown. To address this gap, we sequenced 29 AAB genomes, including three that represent putatively novel species, from a collection of over 500 sourdough starters surveyed globally from community scientists. We found variations in metabolic traits related to carbohydrate utilization, nitrogen metabolism, and alcohol production, as well as in genes related to mobile elements and defense mechanisms. Sourdough AAB genomes did not cluster when compared to AAB isolated from other environments, although a subset of gene functions was enriched in sourdough isolates. The lack of a sourdough-specific genomic cluster may reflect the nomadic lifestyle of AAB. To assess the consequences of AAB on the emergent function of sourdough starter microbiomes, we constructed synthetic starter microbiomes, varying only the AAB strain included. All AAB strains increased the acidification of synthetic sourdough starters relative to yeast and LAB by 18.5% on average. Different strains of AAB had distinct effects on the profile of synthetic starter volatiles. Taken together, our results begin to define the ways in which AAB shape emergent properties of sourdough and suggest that differences in gene content resulting from intraspecies diversification can have community-wide consequences on emergent function.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>This study is a comprehensive genomic and ecological survey of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) isolated from sourdough starters. By combining comparative genomics with manipulative experiments using synthetic microbiomes, we demonstrate that even strains with &gt;97% average nucleotide identity can shift important microbiome functions, underscoring the importance of species and strain diversity in microbial systems. We also demonstrate the utility of sourdough starters as a model system to understand the consequences of genomic diversity at the strain and species level on multispecies communities. These results are also relevant to industrial and home-bakers as we uncover the importance of AAB in shaping properties of sourdough starters that have direct impacts on sensory notes and the quality of sourdough bread.</jats:p>

              <jats:italic>Ah</jats:italic>
              infection, with increased abundance of elastin and collagen alpha-3(VI). Pathway and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins highlights the involvement of ECM-related pathways, including focal adhesions, integrin cell surface interactions, and actin cytoskeleton organization. Focal adhesions, crucial for connecting intracellular actin bundles to the ECM, play a pivotal role in immune response during infections. Increased abundance of integrin alpha 1, integrin beta 1, and tetraspanin suggests their involvement in the host’s response to
              <jats:italic>Ah</jats:italic>
              infection. Proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton reorganization, such as myosin, tropomyosin, and phosphoglucomutase, exhibit increased abundance, influencing changes in cell behavior. Additionally, upregulated proteins like LTBP1 and fibrillin-2 contribute to TGF-β signaling and focal adhesion, indicating their potential role in immune regulation. The study also identifies elevated levels of laminin, galectin 3, and tenascin-C, which interact with integrins and other ECM components, potentially influencing immune cell migration and function. These proteins, along with decorin and lumican, may act as immunomodulators, coordinating pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. ECM fragments released during pathogen invasion could serve as “danger signals,” initiating pathogen clearance and tissue repair through Toll-like receptor signaling.

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of feces collected prior to observable disease onset identified putative metabolite profiles that likely predict future disease severity. Transcriptome analyses performed after disease onset from normal colonic epithelium and tumor tissues show a correlation between GM and host gene expression. Integrated pathway analyses of the metabolome and transcriptome based on putatively identified metabolic features indicate that bile acid biosynthesis is enriched in rats with high tumors along with increased fatty acid metabolism and mucin biosynthesis. Targeted pyrosequencing of the Pirc allele indicates that the GM alters the mechanism of adenoma development and may drive an epigenetic pathway of tumor suppressor silencing.

Furthermore, a systematic reclassification of the Korarchaeota based on 16S rRNA genes and genomes has revealed three novel marine groups (Kor-6 to Kor-8) at the root of the Korarchaeota branch. Kor-6 contains microbes that are present in moderate temperatures. All three novel marine phyla possess genes for the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, and Kor-7 and Kor-8 possess fewer genes encoding oxygen resistance traits than other korarchaeal groups, suggesting a distinct lifestyle for these novel phyla.

Comparative analysis of their gene content revealed that these novel groups exhibit a lifestyle distinct from other Korarchaeota. Specifically, they have the ability to fix carbon exclusively via the Wood–Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, and the genomes within Kor-7 and Kor-8 contain few genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, indicating their strictly anaerobic lifestyle. Further studies suggest that the genes related to methane metabolism and the WL pathway may have been inherited from a common ancestor of the Korarchaeota and that oxygen availability may be one of the important evolutionary factors that shaped the diversification of this archaeal phylum.</jats:p>

            Lignocellulose, as the most abundant natural organic carbon on earth, plays a key role in regulating the global carbon cycle, but there have been only few studies in marine ecosystems. Little information is available about the extant lignin-degrading bacteria in coastal wetlands, limiting our understanding of their ecological roles and traits in lignocellulose degradation. We utilized

            lignocellulose enrichment experiments coupled with 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomics sequencing to identify and characterize bacterial consortia attributed to different lignin/lignocellulosic substrates in the southern-east intertidal zone of East China Sea. We found the consortia enriched on woody lignocellulose showed higher diversity than those on herbaceous substrate. This also revealed substrate-dependent taxonomic groups. A time-dissimilarity pattern with increased alpha diversity over time was observed. Additionally, this study identified a comprehensive set of genes associated with lignin degradation potential, containing 23 gene families involved in lignin depolymerization, and 371 gene families involved in aerobic/anaerobic lignin-derived aromatic compound pathways, challenging the traditional view of lignin recalcitrance within marine ecosystems. In contrast to similar cellulase genes among the lignocellulose substrates, significantly different ligninolytic gene groups were observed between consortia under woody and herbaceous substrates. Importantly, we not only observed synergistic degradation of lignin and hemi-/cellulose, but also pinpointed the potential biological actors at the levels of taxa and functional genes, which indicated that the alternation of aerobic and anaerobic catabolism could facilitate lignocellulose degradation. Our study advances the understanding of coastal bacterial community assembly and metabolic potential for lignocellulose substrates.

SCMV was detected in the roots 9 days after inoculation, and leaf mosaic and chlorosis appeared. The SCMV invasion markedly reduced the α-diversity of endosphere bacteria compared with uninoculated controls (Mock). The connectivity and complexity of the bacterial co-occurrence network in the root endosphere decreased after SCMV invasion, implying that the plant virus may alter root endophyte-microbial interactions. Moreover, a signature that deviates more from stochastic processes was observed in virus-infected plants. Unexpectedly, the rhizosphere bacterial communities were rarely affected by the viral invasion.

            <jats:p>Transcription start sites (TSSs) are fundamental for understanding gene expression and regulation. Agrobacteria, a group of prokaryotes with the ability to transfer DNA into the genomes of host plants, are widely used in plant biotechnology. However, the genome-wide transcriptional regulation of agrobacteria is not well understood, especially in less-studied lineages. Differential RNA-seq and an optimized algorithm enabled identification of thousands of TSSs with nucleotide resolution for representatives of each lineage. The results of this study provide a framework for elucidating the mechanistic basis and evolution of pathology across the three main lineages of agrobacteria.

          <jats:p>Deployment of clinical testing on a massive scale was an essential control measure for curtailing the burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the magnitude of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic during its waves. As the pandemic progressed, new preventive and surveillance mechanisms emerged. Implementation of vaccine programs, wastewater (WW) surveillance, and at-home COVID-19 antigen tests reduced the demand for mass SARS-CoV-2 testing. Unfortunately, reductions in testing and test reporting rates also reduced the availability of public health data to support decision-making. This paper proposes a sequential Bayesian approach to estimate the COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) using SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in WW through an adaptive scheme incorporating changes in virus dynamics. The proposed modeling framework was applied to WW surveillance data from two WW treatment plants in California; the City of Davis and the University of California, Davis campus. TPR estimates are used to compute thresholds for WW data using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thresholds for low (&lt;5% TPR), moderate (5%–8% TPR), substantial (8%–10% TPR), and high (&gt;10% TPR) transmission. The effective reproductive number estimates are calculated using TPR estimates from the WW data. This approach provides insights into the dynamics of the virus evolution and an analytical framework that combines different data sources to continue monitoring COVID-19 trends. These results can provide public health guidance to reduce the burden of future outbreaks as new variants continue to emerge.</jats:p>

We pose an adaptive scheme to model the nonautonomous nature of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The TPR is modeled through a Bayesian sequential approach with a beta regression model using SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in WW as a covariable. The resulting model allows us to compute TPR based on WW measurements and incorporates changes in viral transmission dynamics through an adaptive scheme.</jats:p>

            Microbes commonly organize into communities consisting of hundreds of species involved in complex interactions with each other. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) amplicon profiling provides snapshots that reveal the phylogenies and abundance profiles of these microbial communities. These snapshots, when collected from multiple samples, can reveal the co-occurrence of microbes, providing a glimpse into the network of associations in these communities. However, the inference of networks from 16S data involves numerous steps, each requiring specific tools and parameter choices. Moreover, the extent to which these steps affect the final network is still unclear. In this study, we perform a meticulous analysis of each step of a pipeline that can convert 16S sequencing data into a network of microbial associations. Through this process, we map how different choices of algorithms and parameters affect the co-occurrence network and identify the steps that contribute substantially to the variance. We further determine the tools and parameters that generate robust co-occurrence networks and develop consensus network algorithms based on benchmarks with mock and synthetic data sets. The Microbial Co-occurrence Network Explorer, or MiCoNE (available at

However, processing these data sets to obtain co-occurrence information relies on several complex steps, each of which involves numerous choices of tools and corresponding parameters. These multiple options pose questions about the robustness and uniqueness of the inferred networks. In this study, we address this workflow and provide a systematic analysis of how these choices of tools affect the final network and guidelines on appropriate tool selection for a particular data set.

          <jats:p>Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled many advances across diverse areas of biology, with many benefiting from increased sample size. Although the cost of running next-generation sequencing instruments has dropped substantially over time, the cost of sample preparation methods has lagged behind. To counter this, researchers have adapted library miniaturization protocols and large sample pools to maximize the number of samples that can be prepared by a certain amount of reagents and sequenced in a single run. However, due to high variability of sample quality, over and underrepresentation of samples in a sequencing run has become a major issue in high-throughput sequencing. This leads to misinterpretation of results due to increased noise, and additional time and cost rerunning underrepresented samples. To overcome this problem, we present a normalization method that uses shallow iSeq sequencing to accurately inform pooling volumes based on read distribution. This method is superior to the widely used fluorometry methods, which cannot specifically target adapter-ligated molecules that contribute to sequencing output. Our normalization method not only quantifies adapter-ligated molecules but also allows normalization of feature space; for example, we can normalize to reads of interest such as non-ribosomal reads. As a result, this normalization method improves the efficiency of high-throughput next-generation sequencing by reducing noise and producing higher average reads per sample with more even sequencing depth.</jats:p>

To mitigate this problem, we introduce a normalization method based on read counts rather than library concentration. This method allows for an even distribution of features of interest across samples, improving the statistical power of data sets and preventing the financial loss associated with resequencing libraries. This method optimizes NGS, which already has huge importance across many areas of biology.</jats:p>

            (Mtb), is a global health threat. Targeting host pathways that modulate protective or harmful components of inflammation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy that could aid sterilization or mitigate TB-associated permanent tissue damage. In purified form, many Mtb components can activate innate immune pathways. However, knowledge of the pathways that contribute most to the observed response to live Mtb is incomplete, limiting the possibility of precise intervention. We took a systematic, unbiased approach to define the pathways that drive the earliest immune response to Mtb. Using a macrophage model of infection, we compared the bulk transcriptional response to infection with the response to a panel of Mtb-derived putative innate immune ligands. We identified two axes of response: an NF-kB-dependent response similarly elicited by all Mtb pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and a type I interferon axis unique to cells infected with live Mtb. Consistent with growing literature data pointing to TLR2 as a dominant Mtb-associated PAMP, the TLR2 ligand PIM6 most closely approximated the NF-kB-dependent response to the intact bacterium. Quantitatively, the macrophage response to Mtb was slower and weaker than the response to purified PIM6. On a subpopulation level, the TLR2-dependent response was heterogeneously induced, with only a subset of infected cells expressing key inflammatory genes known to contribute to the control of infection. Despite potential redundancies in Mtb ligand/innate immune receptor interactions during

              Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. Drug resistance is outpacing new antibiotic discovery, and even after successful treatment, individuals are often left with permanent lung damage from the negative consequences of inflammation. Targeting host inflammatory pathways has been proposed as an approach that could either improve sterilization or improve post-treatment lung health. However, our understanding of the inflammatory pathways triggered by
              <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>
              (Mtb) in infected cells and lungs is incomplete, in part because of the complex array of potential molecular interactions between bacterium and host. Here, we take an unbiased approach to identify the pathways most central to the host response to Mtb. We examine how individual pathways are triggered differently by purified Mtb products or infection with the live bacterium and consider how these pathways inform the emergence of subpopulation responses in cell culture and in infected mice. Understanding how individual interactions and immune pathways contribute to inflammation in TB opens the door to the possibility of developing precise therapeutic interventions.

Here, we ask if we can use numerical embeddings generated by protein large language models to detect microcins in bacterial genome assemblies and whether this method can outperform sequence-based methods such as BLAST. We find that embeddings detect known class II microcins much more reliably than does BLAST and that any two microcins tend to have a small distance in embedding space even though they typically are highly diverged at the sequence level.

              . The deletion of
              <jats:italic>Hdac3</jats:italic>
              or
              <jats:italic>Las1</jats:italic>
              reduced the ergosterol content and impaired cell membrane integrity. This resulted in an increase in ROS accumulation in fungal cells that were thus more sensitive to oxidative stress. We further showed that HDAC3 regulated the expression of the three ergosterol biosynthesis genes in an indirect manner. Our work significantly advances insights into the epigenetic regulation of oxidative stress tolerance and the interactions between

                Oxidative stress is a common challenge encountered by fungi that have evolved sophisticated mechanisms underlying tolerance to this stress. Although fungal tolerance to oxidative stress has been extensively investigated, the current understanding of the mechanisms for fungi to regulate oxidative stress tolerance remains limited. In the model entomopathogenic and plant symbiotic fungus
                <jats:italic>Metarhizium robertsii</jats:italic>
                , we found that the histone H3 deacetylase HDAC3 regulates the production of ergosterol, an essential cell membrane component. This maintains the cell membrane integrity to resist the oxidative stress derived from the insect and plant hosts for successful infection of insects and development of symbiotic associates with plants. Our work provides significant insights into the regulation of oxidative stress tolerance in
                <jats:italic>M. robertsii</jats:italic>
                and its interactions with insects and plants.

              , with diverse bioinformatic pipelines employed for virus discovery. Our study uncovered 25 distinct ssRNA viruses, including two ourmia-like viruses, one mitovirus, one fusarivirus, one tobamo-like virus, one cogu-like virus, one bisegmented narna-like virus and one segment of another narna-like virus, and 17 ambi-like viruses, for which hairpin and hammerhead ribozymes were detected. Coinfections of up to 10 viruses were observed in six

              populations in Czechia is highly diverse and differs from that in the boreal region. We further investigated the host effects of certain identified viruses through comparisons of the mycelial growth rate and proteomic analyses and found that certain tested viruses caused growth reductions of up to 22% and significant alterations in the host proteome profile. Their intraspecific transmission rates ranged from 0% to 33%. Further studies are needed to fully understand the biocontrol potential of these viruses

              (UPEC) requires an adaptable physiology to survive the wide range of environments experienced in the host, including gut and urinary tract surfaces. To identify UPEC genes required during intracellular infection, we developed a transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing approach for cellular infection models and searched for genes in a library of ~20,000 UTI89 transposon-insertion mutants that are specifically required at the distinct stages of infection of cultured bladder epithelial cells. Some of the bacterial functional requirements apparent in host bladder cell growth overlapped with those for M9-glycerol, notably nutrient utilization, polysaccharide and macromolecule precursor biosynthesis, and cell envelope stress tolerance. Two genes implicated in the intracellular bladder cell infection stage were confirmed through independent gene deletion studies:
              <jats:italic>neuC</jats:italic>
              (sialic acid capsule biosynthesis) and
              <jats:italic>hisF</jats:italic>
              (histidine biosynthesis). Distinct sets of UPEC genes were also implicated in bacterial dispersal, where UPEC erupts from bladder cells in highly filamentous or motile forms upon exposure to human urine, and during recovery from infection in a rich medium. We confirm that the
              <jats:italic>dedD</jats:italic>
              gene linked to septal peptidoglycan remodeling is required during UPEC dispersal from human bladder cells and may help stabilize cell division or the cell wall during envelope stress created by host cells. Our findings support a view that the host intracellular environment and infection cycle are multi-nutrient limited and create stress that demands an array of biosynthetic, cell envelope integrity, and biofilm-related functions of UPEC.
