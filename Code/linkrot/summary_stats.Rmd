## Linkrot Summary Statistics

```{r setup}
#library statements 
library(tidyverse)

#load data 
linkrot <- read_csv("~/Documents/Schloss/Colovas_Data_Accessibility/Data/final/linkrot_combined.csv.gz")

```

## How many links does each paper have on average? 
- Something is not right with the linkrot functions becasue a bunch of these papers have like 400+ links which is definitely taking into account their citations which is incorrect
- need to go back to the linkrot to make sure i'm excluding the references
- why does it work for some of them but not others???
- is it journal based? 

```{r}
linkrot %>% 
  count(html_filename, sort = TRUE) 

# %>%  
#   summarize(mean = mean(`n`), 
#             median = median(`n`), 
#             range = range(`n`))
```
