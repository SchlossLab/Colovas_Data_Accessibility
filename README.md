# Colovas_Data_Accessibility

New repository for Data Accessibility project begun by Adena Collens. This project, funded by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), aims to determine the extent of data availability, number of citations, and "link rot" in papers published in the ASM family of journals beginning in year 2000.

## Where Do I Go in the Repository? 

1.  20231128_PaperDataCleanup.R to generate into your workspace all necesssary data from relevant files.

2.  20231130_SummaryFigureGenerator.R to create summary figures regarding test case data.

### Other:

-    See most recently dated \*.Rmd file for any relevant project updates.

-   File seq_papers_20230505.RData has been downloaded from github repository Data_Accessibility begun by Adena Collens in 2022 (<https://github.com/SchlossLab/Data_Accessibility/tree/main/data>).

    -   This \*.RData file contains many data frames with previously generated data that will be re-generated in the future, but are useful for testing and piloting purposes.
