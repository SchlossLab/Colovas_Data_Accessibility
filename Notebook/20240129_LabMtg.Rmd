## Project Goals

-   General- Report statistics on the number of citations per paper as a function of data availability from the 12 ASM journals to answer question "Does making publication data available increase citation index of publications?"
-   Proposal - Quantify the benefits of adhering to data accessibility policies for sequencing data at microbiology journals


## Completed Tasks

-   Create "groundtruth.csv" file of N=446 papers with complete metadata from 12 ASM journals
    -   Manually assessed each paper to determine if it was a "New Sequencing Paper" or not, and if "Data Available."
-   Creation of summary figures for the groundtruth dataset on its composition
    -   Separation of papers by journal and by year based on data availability (N=181 with data available)
-   API Key obtained for Clarivate Web of Science-starter API
    -   Clarivate alternatives investigated:
        -   CrossRef doesn't appear to return citation metric information
        -   Scopus API from Elsevier should get citation metrics, has institutional API key available

## Which journals contain papers with new sequencing data?

## Of papers with new sequencing data, how many contain publicly available data?

## Do papers with sequencing data available have more citations?

## Does the number of papers with data available change based on date published?

## Do papers with sequencing data available have more citations based on year published?
-   Do we need more papers for the training set based on the composition of the current training set?

## Webscraping Status
- Test script works to eliminate table and figure captions using rvest and XML2! (Thanks Greg!)
- Some remaining issues for web scraping:
    -   Headings still in scrape (h2 and h3)
		-   Hyphen removal using [:punct:] smashes some words together
		-   Some special characters still appear


## Next Steps - Tidy Text

-   Tackle converting example scraped text into tidy text format (one token/line)
    -   readLines() %>% unnest_tokens()
    -   allows for greater use of tidytext package, helps compute metrics and work with text
-   Anti join with stop words df to remove common words
    -   could also remove words < 3 letters/characters (AC did, would probably get rid of special characters)
    -   can also make custom df of stop words to remove
-   Does word frequency matter for each paper or just collectively for each larger grouping (ie contains new data or has data available)
    - if word frequency doesn't matter for each paper, we can remove duplicate words and make dfs smaller
    
## Next Steps - Storage and GL

-   Storage of tidy text data frames for each paper, dependent somewhat on size
-   Purrring for scraping and cleaning of all paper texts from the groundtruth dataset
    -   GL scripting and polite package
    -   ensure correct conda env is active
    -   polite must be installed in R, not able to install using conda env
