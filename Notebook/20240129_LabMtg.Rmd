## Project Goals

-   Report statistics on the number of citations per paper as a function of data availability from the 12 ASM journals to answer question "Does making publication data available increase citation index of publications?"

## Completed Tasks

-   Create "groundtruth.csv" file of N=446 papers with complete metadata from 12 ASM journals
-   "Manually-coded"/manually assessed (with help from Adena and lab!) each paper to determine if it was a "New Sequencing Paper" or not, and if "Data Available."
-   Creation of summary figures for the groundtruth dataset on its composition
-   Separation of papers by journal and by year based on data availability
