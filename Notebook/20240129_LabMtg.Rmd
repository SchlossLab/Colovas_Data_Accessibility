## Project Goals

-   General- Report statistics on the number of citations per paper as a function of data availability from the 12 ASM journals to answer question "Does making publication data available increase citation index of publications?"
-   Proposal - Quantify the benefits of adhering to data accessibility policies for sequencing data at microbiology journals


## Completed Tasks

-   Create "groundtruth.csv" file of N=446 papers with complete metadata from 12 ASM journals
    -   Manually assessed each paper to determine if it was a "New Sequencing Paper" or not, and if "Data Available."
-   Creation of summary figures for the groundtruth dataset on its composition
    -   Separation of papers by journal and by year based on data availability (N=181 with data available)
-   API Key obtained for Clarivate Web of Science-starter API
    -   Clarivate alternatives investigated:
        -   CrossRef doesn't appear to return citation metric information
        -   Scopus API from Elsevier should get citation metrics, has institutional API key available

## Which journals contain papers with new sequencing data?

## Of papers with new sequencing data, how many contain publicly available data?

## Do papers with sequencing data available have more citations?

## Does the number of papers with data available change based on date published?

## Do papers with sequencing data available have more citations based on year published?

## Current and Next Steps

-   Web scraping with the elimination of figure and table captions using package rvest
    -   Issue: current selectors do not eliminate figure and table captions
    -   Investigate rvest functions for correct "not" operator
    -   Comb page HTML tags for more precise selectors of what we DO want from the web page
    -   Several more test papers from ASM to determine if function works as intended
-   Do we want the text scraped without HTML tags or keep them?
    -   Does removing them later pose a problem?
-   Do we need more papers for the training set based on the composition of the current training set?
