The effect of optimized maternal therapy by bactericidal agents was evaluated in a reproducible rabbit model of Escherichia coli maternofetal infection simulating human pharmacokinetics Intravenous antibiotic therapy was begun in the pregnant rabbit  h after bacterial intrauterine inoculation using a computercontrolled pump to simulate human pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone  gday associated or not with gentamicin  mgkg of body weightday Data were compared for fetal survival quantitative blood cultures fetal histology in treated versus untreated groups and maternal and fetal antibiotic concentrations in plasma in treated animals Antibiotic therapy led to dramatic improvement in maternal outcome  survival versus  death in the untreated group in association with maternal septicemia Fetal survival also improved with the twodrug combination providing a more potent effect After  days of treatment  of fetuses survived with onedrug therapy and  with twodrug therapy Yates corrected Ï P <  In untreated animals bacterial counts in blood cultures increased rapidly during the first  h up to  Â±  log CFUml but remained relatively constant at all times with antibiotic treatment  Â±  log CFUml at the start of treatment and  Â±  and  Â±  log CFUml after  h for one and twodrug therapy respectively data are means Â± standard deviations The failure of animals to be cured after  days of treatment was not due to an inadequate concentration of ceftriaxone as the residual level in fetal serum at sacrifice was more than  times the MIC of the microbe Unexpectedly inflammation in fetal lung decreased in the treated group after as little as  h of antibiotic therapy despite persistent bacteremia Although maternal outcome improved and drug concentrations were above the MIC the treatment did not achieve sterilization of fetuses in utero for this rabbit E coli maternofetal infection However fetal survival showed some improvement and the histologic features of lung inflammation were reduced This study was performed with Escherichia coli K strain RS OKH isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a newborn Virulence factors and invasion genes have been characterized in this strain   The MICs of ceftriaxone and gentamicin were  and  mgliter respectively The day before the experiment the study strain was incubated in MuellerHinton MH broth Difco Becton Dickinson Le Pont de Clair France for  h at Â°C This suspension was then diluted in sterile NaCl  solution to obtain bacterial concentrations of   or  CFUml which were checked by nephelometry or quantitative cultures on MH agar  Female New Zealand rabbits weighing  to  kg were obtained CEGAV Saint Marc dEgrenne France  days before the end of their normal gestation period ie  to  days and provided ad libitum with water and food consisting of antibioticfree granules One week before the normal term of gestation ie day  they were anesthetized with  mg of ketaminekg A cm vertical incision was performed along the median line below the gravid uterus and an inoculum of either   or  CFU was injected under visual control into one of the horns intraamniotic inoculation The incision was then closed up level by level and the animal was returned to its cage The mothers were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups i untreated animals sacrificed  h n   or  h n   after inoculation or kept alive for followup n   ii animals treated by ceftriaxone alone for  n    n   or  h n   iii or animals treated by ceftriaxone and gentamicin for  n    n   or  h n   In all cases treatment was begun  h after intrauterine inoculation Ceftriaxone Rocephine Laboratoires Roche and gentamicin Gentamicine Laboratoire Schering Plough were diluted in a  NaCl solution for intravenous administration to mother rabbits through a catheter inserted into a marginal vein of the ear for group iii each ear was used for an antibiotic For both drugs a computercontrolled variable infusion rate was delivered and adjusted as previously reported   in order to attain concentrations in mother rabbit plasma that mimic the pharmacokinetics observed in humans after a single daily injection of ceftriaxone  gday or gentamicin  mgkgday Accordingly the objectives of this human pharmacokinetic simulation were a peak at  mgliter and a halflife of  h for gentamicin and a peak at  mgliter and a halflife of  h for ceftriaxone The total doses actually administered to animals to meet these pharmacokinetic requirements were  and  mgkgday for ceftriaxone and gentamicin respectively Blood samples for antibiotic assays were obtained from mother rabbits three or four mothers for each antibiotic   and  h after the beginning of treatment by means of a catheter inserted into the central artery of the ear contralateral to that infused with the antibiotic assayed Fetal blood from three or four living fetuses per mother was sampled by intracardiac puncture at the time of sacrifice Ceftriaxone was assayed by highperformance liquid chromatography based on the method proposed by Jehl et al for betalactams  using a mobile phase comprising  M sodium phosphate pH   vol and acetonitrile  vol with a quantification limit of  mgliter a linearity range of up to  mgliter and interrun coefficient of variation at  mgliter Gentamicin concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay  Axsym Abbott Laboratories Rungis France with a detection threshold at  mgliter inter and intrarun coefficients of variation below  within the working range from  to  mgliter and automated dilution for samples with a higher concentration As echocardiographic evaluation of prenatal survival was unsatisfactory in this model true survival followup could not be performed Thus the fetuses were extracted by cesarean section under anesthesia propofol  mgkg to determine endpoint survival rates   or  h after the beginning of treatment according to the study design described above All animals were then sacrificed ether for fetuses and  mg of thiopental sodium for mothers to evaluate other judgment criteria Untreated animals underwent cesarean section according to the same protocol  h after inoculation At the time of sacrifice blood was withdrawn from the hearts of mothers and fetuses for quantitative cultures The Î¼l blood samples were mixed with  Î¼l of heparinized  IUliter physiological serum After centrifugation  Ã g for  min  Î¼l of the pellet was plated on MH agar Difco Becton Dickinson and incubated at Â°C for  h before bacterial counts were performed To avoid any carryover phenomenon blood was cultured in the presence of cephalosporinase of Enterobacter cloacae P Sigma Lyon France at a dose of  IUml This method allows detection of an inoculum of  CFUml The placenta of each fetoplacental unit was rinsed with sterile saline and placed individually in MH broth containing cephalosporinase  IUml of E cloacae P Sigma for h incubation at CÂ°C All tubes with turbid culture medium were then cultured again in specific eosinmethylene blue agar Difco Becton Dickinson for E coli selection and identification Samples of uterus placenta fetal brain and lung were fixed in  formalin and embedded in paraffin Paraffin sections  Î¼m thick were stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin techniques Inflammation was evaluated in a blinded fashion by an investigator using a fourlevel semiquantitative scoring system based on signs of congestion and edema necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate â no sign of inflammation Â± some signs of inflammation + moderate signs of inflammation ++ marked signs of inflammation Bacterial counts from blood cultures were subjected to oneway analysis of variance according to the different groups followed by a Scheffes test for intergroup comparisons Statview Abacus Concepts Berkeley Calif Percentages were compared by a chisquare test with Yates correction A P of < was considered significant A pilot study involving  animals was performed first to determine the experimental conditions providing the most efficient model ensuring a high rate of infection and high fetal survival at the beginning of treatment Various bacterial inocula   and  CFU and various infection periods    and  h were tested The best compromise was an inoculum of  CFU and a h period providing  maternal positive blood cultures without any maternal death and an  fetal survival rate with positive blood cultures in  of infected fetuses A lower initial inoculum gave a lower rate of infected fetuses whereas a higher inoculum caused early death of the animals Periods longer than  h were associated with an increased maternal and fetal death rate preventing pertinent evaluation of treatment At the beginning of antibiotic treatment  h after inoculation of  CFU E coli the survival rate was   of  and   of  for control mothers and fetuses respectively All mothers without treatment died within the next  h whereas  of those treated survived throughout the followup period  h after the beginning of treatment Table  shows the different fetal survival rates depending on the treatment period and the therapeutic regimen administered Fetal death was  for untreated fetuses within the second day of infection The best survival rate was observed with twodrug therapy Ï P <  Maternal bacteremia at the beginning of treatment showed a mean level of  Â±  log CFUml Fig  data are presented as means Â± standard deviations Maternal blood cultures were sterile after  and  h of treatment by one or twodrug therapy while the bacterial count reached a value of  Â±  log CFUml in untreated mothers Figure  also indicates the level of fetal bacteremia in treated and control groups Twelve hours after inoculation  Â±  log CFUml were quantified in fetal blood Bacteremia increased further reaching a mean level of  Â±  log CFUml  h after inoculation for dead fetuses in the untreated group No treated fetuses had sterile blood cultures at any time during followup In fact fetal bacteremia increased by  log CFUml after  h of treatment with ceftriaxone alone and continued treatment only allowed the bacterial inoculum to be maintained at this level Levels of  Â±   Â±  and  Â±  log CFUml were quantified in blood after   or  h of treatment respectively Similarly the association of gentamicin with ceftriaxone had only a bacteriostatic effect maintaining fetal bacteremia at around  log CFUml Levels of  Â±   Â±  and  Â±  log CFUml were quantified in blood after   or  h of treatment respectively After  h of treatment by ceftriaxone or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin respectively  of   and  of   of placental cultures remained positive Figure  shows the fetal and maternal antibiotic serum concentrations measured after   or  h of treatment Ceftriaxone values were usually more than a thousand times higher than the MIC for E coli in fetuses suggesting that the concentrations observed were efficient throughout the experimental period Similarly the trough concentration of gentamicin observed in fetuses from  to  mgliter indicated that therapeutic concentrations were reached at peak time in treated animals The progressively higher residual values for gentamicin in fetuses was indicative of an accumulative trend Table  summarizes the results of semiquantitative analysis of inflammation in the uterus placenta and fetal lung and brain The uterus showed acute inflammation with large ulcerations and numerous neutrophils This acute inflammation was similar in untreated mothers and in those treated with ceftriaxone and gentamicin for  or  h Twelve hours after inoculation the placenta displayed signs of chorioamnionitis with congested villi neutrophil infiltrates and bacteria in chorial lesions and the amnion The initial inflammation observed in the placenta worsened dramatically Even with twodrug therapy applied for  or  h inflammation persisted or even worsened In fetal brain no inflammation was observed regardless of the group examined untreated or treated as previously described   In lung of infected fetuses inflammation was slight to moderate with discrete edema and only a few neutrophils After  or  h of antibiotic therapy there were no signs of inflammation in most cases lung features similar to those of controls Survival rate of fetuses in a rabbit maternofetal E coli infection model Antibiotic treatments were administered  h after bacterial inoculation Antibiotics were administered to mother rabbits by intravenous infusion at a controlled variable rate allowing the maternal plasma concentration to be similar to that of human pharmacokinetics obtained with oncedaily doses of  gday ceftriaxone and  mgkgday gentamicin The actual doses administered to the rabbit were  mg of
