-   Abstract
-   Importance
    -   Investigate the number of links that are still viable in published scientific papers
    -   Why do we care? 
        -   We want people to be able to access resources in perpetuity
        -   Reproducible research aims 
            -   "By providing persistent
 links to the underlying data, methods, code, and derivative products, the paper
 becomes more transparent." - from Pat's ORI narrative 
    -   A lot of large datasets/code are available at links as well as code, and we want that to be accessible 
        -   NCBI datasets
        -   Github repositories

-   Keywords
    -   Data accessibility
    -   Data reproducibility
-   Introduction
    -   Data availbility status/current availability and reproducibility guidelines
    -   Why make data available?
    -   How does this contribute to data availability?

    -   Table of findings x# of links from x# of papers
        -   Number of links that are still alive
        -   What kind of errors we have for the links in each paper
        -   Average number of links/paper
        -   Does this change by journal?
