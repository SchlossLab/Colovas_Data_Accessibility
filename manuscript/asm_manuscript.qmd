-   Abstract
-   Importance
    -   Incentivize authors to publish/make available their
        original data
    -   Publishing data helps get more use out of research
    -   Helps eliminate file drawer effect as it shows negative
        data
    
-   Keywords
    -   Data accessibility
    -   Data reproducibility
    
-   Introduction
    -   NIH funded research must make data available as of January 2023
        (Policy for Data Management and Sharing (NOT-OD-21-013))
    -   Investigate metrics of making data publicly available in 12 ASM
        journals
    -   DNA sequencing efforts are commonly uploaded to databases
        -   Want to evaluate how well this community is using
            reproducible data analysis as a metric
        -   International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INDSC) databases
    -   COVID sequencing and data availability was essential to vaccine development 
    -   
-   Results
    -   Models 
    -   Model prediction results
    -   Confusion Matricies for each model 
        -   Spot checking and error methodology
    -   Regression modeling
    -   Regression modeling/confusion matricies for papers that contain new sequence data
    -   Citations corrected for time
    
-   Discussion
    -   Making data available provides more citations per paper than not doing so.
    -   Allows for replication of studies
    -   

-   Materials and Methods
    -   Oringinal dataset from Adena (which I think is downloaded from crossref)
    -   Hand identifying 500 papers for da and nsd status
    -   Training model using mikropml methodology
    -   Training of the models
    -   Picking the best model (glmnet, rf, xgbtree, picked rf)
    -   Hypertuning parameters (rf = mtry)
    -   Snakemake/python
    -   Crossref gathering of DOIs (146K)
    -   Webscrape using httr2/rcrossref/wget
    -   Cleaning of html of each indiviudal file
    -   Tokenizing, stemming/lemmitization
    -   Formatting/applying zscore (and replicating that for the rest of
        the datasets)
    -   Using the model to predict da/nsd for new data 
    
-   Supplemental Material file list (where applicable)
