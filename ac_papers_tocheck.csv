            maternofetal infection simulating human pharmacokinetics. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was begun in the pregnant rabbit 12 h after bacterial intrauterine inoculation, using a computer-controlled pump to simulate human pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone (1 g/day) associated or not with gentamicin (3 mg/kg of body weight/day). Data were compared for fetal survival, quantitative blood cultures, fetal histology in treated versus untreated groups, and maternal and fetal antibiotic concentrations in plasma in treated animals. Antibiotic therapy led to dramatic improvement in maternal outcome (100% survival versus 100% death in the untreated group in association with maternal septicemia). Fetal survival also improved, with the two-drug combination providing a more potent effect. After 3 days of treatment, 32% of fetuses survived with one-drug therapy and 62% with two-drug therapy (Yates corrected χ

In untreated animals, bacterial counts in blood cultures increased rapidly during the first 24 h up to 8.1 ± 0.5 log CFU/ml, but remained relatively constant at all times with antibiotic treatment: 4.5 ± 0.7 log CFU/ml at the start of treatment and 6.2 ± 0.4 and 5.2 ± 0.9 log CFU/ml after 72 h for one- and two-drug therapy, respectively (data are means ± standard deviations). The failure of animals to be cured after 3 days of treatment was not due to an inadequate concentration of ceftriaxone, as the residual level in fetal serum at sacrifice was more than 1,000 times the MIC of the microbe. Unexpectedly, inflammation in fetal lung decreased in the treated group after as little as 24 h of antibiotic therapy, despite persistent bacteremia. Although maternal outcome improved and drug concentrations were above the MIC, the treatment did not achieve sterilization of fetuses in utero for this rabbit

Many of the Erp proteins bind a host complement regulator, factor H, which is hypothesized to protect the spirochete from complement-mediated killing. We now describe the isolation and characterization of a novel, chromosomally encoded protein, EbfC, that binds specific DNA sequences located immediately 5′ of all

            in cat populations was evaluated by serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18%) resulted in detection of bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serology; 207 (38%) were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results for 65 (12.2%) showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The molecular typing of the isolates showed that 20.6% of bacteremic cats were infected with

Statistical analysis showed no association between characteristics such as seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological test was 84.7%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8%. Receiving operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of

            operon promoter can be fully activated by binding of the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) to a site centered at position −41.5 upstream of the transcript start, and this activation is modulated by upstream binding of the integration host factor (IHF) and Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) proteins. Thus, transcription initiation is repressed by the binding of IHF and Fis to sites centered at position −88 (IHF I) and position −142 (Fis I) and activated by IHF binding to a site at position −115 (IHF II). Here, we have exploited mutational analysis and biochemistry to investigate the actions of IHF and Fis at these sites. We show that the effects of IHF and Fis are position dependent and that IHF II functions independently of IHF I and Fis I.

            exists either in a free-living state in the soil or in
symbiosis within legume nodules, where the bacteria differentiate into
nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Expression of genes involved in nitrogen
fixation and associated respiration is governed by two intermediate
regulators, NifA and FixK, respectively, which are controlled by a
two-component regulatory system FixLJ in response to low-oxygen
conditions. In order to identify the FixLJ regulon, gene expression
profiles were determined in microaerobic free-living cells as well as
during the symbiotic life of the bacterium for the wild type and a
            <jats:italic>fixJ</jats:italic>
            null-mutant strain. We identified 122 genes activated by
FixJ in either state, including 87 novel targets. FixJ controls 74% of
the genes induced in microaerobiosis (2% oxygen) and the majority of
genes expressed in mature bacteroids. Ninety-seven percent of
FixJ-activated genes are located on the symbiotic plasmid pSymA.

showed that NifA activates a limited number of genes, all specific to
the symbiotic state, whereas FixK controls more than 90 genes, involved
in free-living and/or symbiotic life. This study also revealed that
FixJ has no other direct targets besides those already known. FixJ is
involved in the regulation of functions such as denitrification or
amino acid/polyamine metabolism and transport. Mutations in selected
novel FixJ targets did not affect the ability of the bacteria to form
nitrogen-fixing nodules on

            continues to pose a health threat in many developing nations and regions of the world struck by natural disasters. It is a pathogen that rapidly adapts to aquatic environments and the human small intestine. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) may contribute to this adaptability. Specifically, the mannitol operon sRNA (MtlS sRNA; previously designated the IGR7 sRNA) is transcribed antisense to the 5′ untranslated region of the
            <jats:italic>mtl</jats:italic>
            operon, encoding the mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system. Mannitol is a six-carbon sugar alcohol that accumulates in the human small intestine, the primary site of
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">V. cholerae</jats:named-content>

            <jats:italic>mtl</jats:italic>
            operon at a molecular level, we investigated
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>
            expression in the presence of various carbon sources and the role of the MtlS sRNA. We observed that MtlA protein is present only in cells grown on mannitol sugar, whereas MtlS sRNA is expressed during growth on all sugars other than mannitol. In contrast,
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>
            mRNA is expressed in similar amounts regardless of the carbon source used for bacterial growth. These observations suggest that the regulation of MtlA protein expression is a posttranscriptional event. We further demonstrate that MtlS sRNA overexpression repressed MtlA synthesis without affecting the stability of the messenger and that this process is largely independent of Hfq. We propose a model in which, when carbon sources other than mannitol are present, MtlS sRNA is transcribed, base pairs with the 5′ untranslated region of the
            <jats:italic>mtlA</jats:italic>
            mRNA, occluding the ribosome binding site, and inhibits the synthesis of the mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system.

          <jats:p>Supplemental assays, such as recombinant immunoblot assays (RIBA), are used to confirm detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, due to their expense, they are not widely used in developing countries. The purpose of our study was to compare the results of second- and third-generation (G2 and G3, respectively) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and to resolve discordant results by using a supplemental assay to assess the reliability of G2 and G3 EIAs to confirm anti-HCV antibody-positive results. We performed both G2 and G3 EIAs for anti-HCV antibodies on 1,134 serum samples collected during the 2nd year of a longitudinal community-based study in Egypt; 35 samples with discordant results were tested by Abbott Laboratories Micro-Particle Immunoassay (M-EIA) and RIBA. Viremia was determined with an in-house nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect HCV RNA. Concordance between the two assays (G2/G3) was 96.9%; 87 (7.7%) samples were positive and 1,012 (89.2%) were negative by both assays. For 17 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay negative and G3 assay positive, and for 18 samples, the discordant results were G2 assay positive and G3 assay negative. Among the 17 G2 assay-negative and G3 assay-positive samples, 15 were M-EIA positive and 7 were PCR positive. Among the 18 G2 assay-positive and G3 assay-negative samples, 2 were M-EIA positive and none were PCR positive. RIBA results from 24 discordant samples showed 87.5% agreement with the G3 EIA, 12.5% agreement with the G2 EIA, and 95.8% agreement with M-EIA. Eleven samples were indeterminate by RIBA and excluded from this analysis. Based on RIBA results, the sensitivity of the G3 EIA was 99%, compared to 89.8% for the G2 EIA, while the specificity of the G3 EIA was 99.8%, compared to 98.9% for the G2 EIA. These results show that the reliability of the G3 EIA in screening these sera is excellent, and the G3 assay can be used in the absence of supplemental tests where resources are limited. RIBA appears not to have advantages over the less expensive M-EIA screening assay. The main disadvantage of RIBA is the occurrence of indeterminate results, especially among problematic samples. Samples giving discordant results in multiple assays are often indeterminate with the RIBA.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA

            ribotype 027 isolates as the basis for comparison of two capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-based ribotyping methods. There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three different primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method. Similar differences between SCGE and QCGE were found on testing of 14 isolates of four other

            spp. exhibited significant increases in the rates of resistance to moxifloxacin over the 8 years. Resistance rates and GM MICs for tigecycline were low and stable during the 5-year period over which this agent was studied. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol (MICs &lt; 16 μg/ml). In 2002, one isolate resistant to metronidazole (MIC = 64 μg/ml) was noted. These data indicate changes in susceptibility over time; surprisingly, some antimicrobial agents are more active now than they were 5 years ago.

            The objective of the present trial was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of moxifloxacin (400 mg) given intravenously (i.v.) once daily followed by oral moxifloxacin (400 mg) for 7 to 14 days with the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of co-amoxiclav (1.2 g) administered by i.v. infusion three times a day followed by oral co-amoxiclav (625 mg) three times a day, with or without clarithromycin (500 mg) twice daily (i.v. or orally), for 7 to 14 days in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring initial parenteral therapy. A total of 628 patients were enrolled and assessed by evaluation of their clinical and bacteriological responses 5 to 7 days and 21 to 28 days after administration of the last dose of study medication. Although the trial was designed, on the basis of predefined outcomes, to demonstrate the equivalence of the two regimens, the results showed statistically significant higher clinical success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.4%, and for comparator regimen, 85.4%; difference [Δ], 8.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91 to 13.19%;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.004) and bacteriological success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.7%, and for comparator regimen, 81.7%; Δ, 12.06%; 95% CI, 1.21 to 22.91%) for patients treated with moxifloxacin. This superiority was seen irrespective of the severity of the pneumonia and whether or not the combination therapy included a macrolide. The time to resolution of fever was also statistically significantly faster for patients who received moxifloxacin (median time, 2 versus 3 days), and the duration of hospital admission was approximately 1 day less for patients who received moxifloxacin. The treatment was converted to oral therapy immediately after the initial mandatory 3-day period of i.v. administration for a larger proportion of patients in the moxifloxacin group than patients in the comparator group (151 [50.2%] versus 57 [17.8%] patients). There were fewer deaths (9 [3.0%] versus 17 [5.3%]) and fewer serious adverse events (38 [12.6%] versus 53 [16.5%]) in the moxifloxacin group than in the comparator group. The rates of drug-related adverse events were comparable in both groups (38.9% in each treatment group). The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. Thus, it is concluded that monotherapy with moxifloxacin is superior to that with a standard combination regimen of a β-lactam and a β-lactamase inhibitor, co-amoxiclav, with or without a macrolide, clarithromycin, in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to a hospital.

            , have a high potential for industrial applications. Recent studies showed that deletion of six AT-rich islands from the
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            genome results in reduced amounts of extracellular LipA. Here we demonstrate that the reduced LipA levels are due to the absence of four genes,

            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            168 but also under conditions of LipA overproduction. Notably, SkfA has bactericidal activity and, probably, requires the SkfB to SkfD proteins for its production. The present results show that LipA is more prone to proteolytic degradation in the absence of SkfA and that high-level LipA production can be improved significantly by employing multiple protease-deficient
            <jats:italic>B. subtilis</jats:italic>
            strains. In conclusion, our findings imply that SkfA protects LipA, directly or indirectly, against proteolytic degradation. Conceivably, SkfA could act as a modulator in LipA folding or as a protease inhibitor.

            is a planktonic unicellular cyanobacterium often responsible for seasonal mass occurrences at the surface of freshwater environments. An abundant production of intracellular structures, the gas vesicles, provides cells with buoyancy. A 8.7-kb gene cluster that comprises twelve genes involved in gas vesicle synthesis was identified. Ten of these are organized in two operons,

            into one of the 12 major sublineages or subgroups. All strains could be correctly positioned on the canonical SNP (canSNP) phylogenetic tree, except the divergent Pasteur vaccine strain ATCC 4229. We detected the cooccurrence of three canSNP subgroups in France. The dominant B.Br.CNEVA sublineage was found to be prevalent in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Auvergne region, and the Saône-et-Loire department. Strains affiliated with the A.Br.008/009 subgroup were observed throughout most of the country. The minor A.Br.001/002 subgroup was restricted to northeastern France. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis using 24 markers further resolved French strains into 60 unique profiles and identified some regional patterns. Diversity found within the A.Br.008/009 and B.Br.CNEVA subgroups suggests that these represent old, ecologically established clades in France. Phylogenetic relationships with strains from other parts of the world are discussed.

            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoter or a mutated derivative of this promoter were constructed, which facilitated both transcriptional and translational promoter-gene fusions. Functional characterization of both
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoters and the cognate expression host could be performed by controlled overproduction of the β-glucuronidase (GusA) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. Both
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoters exhibited very low levels of basal expression, while extremely high levels of expression were observed upon induction with subtilin. Moreover, the level of expression depended directly on the amount of inducer (subtilin) used. The wild-type
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoter appeared to be more strictly controlled by the addition of subtilin, while the highest levels of expression were obtained when the mutated
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoter was used. Induction by subtilin led to 110- and 80-fold increases in GusA activity for the
            <jats:italic>spaS</jats:italic>
            promoter and its mutant derivative, respectively. Since the SURE system has attractive functional characteristics, including promoter silence under noninducing conditions and a controlled and high level of expression upon induction, and since it is not subject to catabolite control, we anticipate that it can provide a suitable expression system for various scientific and industrial applications.

          <jats:p>
            Influenza A virus (IAV) RNA segments are individually packaged with viral nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA polymerases to form a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. We previously reported that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein which can be deubiquitinated by a cellular ubiquitin protease, USP11. In this study, we identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4 (Ccr4-Not transcription complex subunit 4), which can ubiquitinate NP. We found that the levels of viral RNA, protein, viral particles, and RNA polymerase activity in CNOT4 knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells upon IAV infection. Conversely, overexpression of CNOT4 rescued viral RNP activity. In addition, CNOT4 interacted with the NP in the cell. An
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            ubiquitination assay also showed that NP could be ubiquitinated by
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            -translated CNOT4, but ubiquitination did not affect the protein stability of NP. Significantly, CNOT4 increased NP ubiquitination, whereas USP11 decreased it. Mass spectrometry analysis of ubiquitinated NP revealed multiple ubiquitination sites on the various lysine residues of NP. Three of these, K184, K227, and K273, are located on the RNA-binding groove of NP. Mutations of these sites to arginine reduced viral RNA replication. These results indicate that CNOT4 is a ubiquitin ligase of NP, and ubiquitination of NP plays a positive role in viral RNA replication.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza virus, particularly influenza A virus, causes severe and frequent outbreaks among human and avian species. Finding potential target sites for antiviral agents is of utmost importance from the public health point of view. We previously found that viral nucleoprotein (NP) is ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination enhances viral RNA replication. In this study, we found a cellular ubiquitin ligase, CNOT4, capable of ubiquitinating NP. The ubiquitination sites are scattered on the surface of the NP molecule, which is critical for RNA replication. CNOT4 and a ubiquitin protease, USP11, together regulate the extent of NP ubiquitination and thereby the efficiency of RNA replication. This study thus identifies a potential antiviral target site and reveals a novel posttranslational mechanism for regulating viral replication. This represents a novel finding in the literature of influenza virus research.

            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            . Experimental and X-ray crystal structure-guided computational studies revealed that lipocalins counteract antibiotic action by capturing antibiotics in the extracellular space. We also demonstrated that fat-soluble vitamins prevent antibiotic capture by binding bacterial lipocalin with higher affinity than antibiotics. Therefore, bacterial lipocalins contribute to antimicrobial resistance by capturing diverse antibiotics in the extracellular space at the site of infection, which can be counteracted by known vitamins.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Current research on antibiotic action and resistance focuses on targeting essential functions within bacterial cells. We discovered a previously unrecognized mode of general bacterial antibiotic resistance operating in the extracellular space, which depends on bacterial protein molecules called lipocalins. These molecules are highly conserved in most bacteria and have the ability to capture different classes of antibiotics outside bacterial cells. We also discovered that liposoluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, overcome
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>
            antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial lipocalins, providing an unexpected new alternative to combat resistance by using this vitamin or its derivatives as antibiotic adjuvants.

The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment with adefovir, a new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, the prodrug of which, adefovir dipivoxil, is in clinical evaluation, is able to suppress viral CCC DNA both in vitro and in vivo using the duck HBV (DHBV) model. First, the effect of adefovir on viral CCC DNA synthesis was examined with primary cultures of DHBV-infected fetal hepatocytes. Adefovir was administered for six consecutive days starting one day before or four days after DHBV inoculation. Dose-dependent inhibition of both virion release in culture supernatants and synthesis of intracellular viral DNA was observed. Although CCC DNA amplification was inhibited by adefovir, CCC DNA was not eliminated by antiviral treatment and the de novo formation of CCC DNA was not prevented by pretreatment of the cells. Next, preventive treatment of experimentally infected ducklings with lamivudine or adefovir revealed that both efficiently suppressed viremia and intrahepatic DNA. However, persistence of viral DNA even when detectable only by PCR was associated with a recurrence of viral replication following drug withdrawal. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adefovir is a potent inhibitor of DHBV replication that inhibits CCC DNA amplification but does not effectively prevent the formation of CCC DNA from incoming viral genomes.</jats:p>",en,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,NA

            Target site inaccessibility represents a significant problem for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of 16S rRNA with oligonucleotide probes. Here, unlabeled oligonucleotides (helpers) that bind adjacent to the probe target site were evaluated for their potential to increase weak probe hybridization signals in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            DSM 30083
            <jats:sup>T</jats:sup>
            . The use of helpers enhanced the fluorescence signal of all six probes examined at least fourfold. In one case, the signal of probe Eco474 was increased 25-fold with the use of a single helper probe, H440-2. In another case, four unlabeled helpers raised the FISH signal of a formerly weak probe, Eco585, to the level of the brightest monolabeled oligonucleotide probes available for
            <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>
            . The temperature of dissociation and the mismatch discrimination of probes were not significantly influenced by the addition of helpers. Therefore, using helpers should not cause labeling of additional nontarget organisms at a defined stringency of hybridization. However, the helper action is based on sequence-specific binding, and there is thus a potential for narrowing the target group which must be considered when designing helpers. We conclude that helpers can open inaccessible rRNA regions for FISH with oligonucleotide probes and will thereby further improve the applicability of this technique for in situ identification of microorganisms.

            , respectively), in 0.02 and 0.2 M buffer solutions. At the highest ionic strength, we did not observe a significant difference in the attachment rate of wild-type and paralyzed cells at either fluid velocity. However, when the ionic strength was reduced, paralyzed bacteria attached at rates 4 and 10 times lower than that of the wild type under fluid velocities of 0.0044 and 0.044 cms
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
            , respectively. This suggested that the rotation of the flagella assisted in attachment. We then compared the attachment rates of smooth-swimming (counterclockwise rotation only) and tumbly (clockwise rotation only) cells to the wild type to determine whether the direction of rotation was important to cell attachment. At 0.0044 cms
            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>
            , the smooth-swimming cells attached at rates similar to that of the wild type in both buffer solutions but significantly less at the higher fluid velocity. Tumbly cells attached at much lower rates under all conditions. Thus, the combination of clockwise and counterclockwise flagellar rotation and their coupling appeared to be important in cell attachment.

            Five different methods were used to identify yeast isolates from a variety of citrus juice sources. A total of 99 strains, including reference strains, were identified using a partial sequence of the 26S rRNA gene, restriction pattern analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (5.8S-ITS), classical methodology, the RapID Yeast Plus system, and API 20C AUX. Twenty-three different species were identified representing 11 different genera. Distribution of the species was considerably different depending on the type of sample. Fourteen different species were identified from pasteurized single-strength orange juice that had been contaminated after pasteurization (PSOJ), while only six species were isolated from fresh-squeezed, unpasteurized orange juice (FSOJ). Among PSOJ isolates,
            <jats:italic>Candida intermedia</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Candida parapsilosis</jats:italic>
            were the predominant species.
            <jats:italic>Hanseniaspora occidentalis</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Hanseniaspora uvarum</jats:italic>
            represented up to 73% of total FSOJ isolates. Partial sequence of the 26S rRNA gene yielded the best results in terms of correct identification, followed by classical techniques and 5.8S-ITS analysis. The commercial identification kits RapID Yeast Plus system and API 20C AUX were able to correctly identify only 35 and 13% of the isolates, respectively. Six new 5.8S-ITS profiles were described, corresponding to

The recombinant yeast was more iron tolerant in that 95% of transformed cells, but none of the recipient strain cells, could form colonies on plates containing 30 mM ferric citrate. The cell-associated concentration of iron was 500 μg per gram (dry cell weight) of the recombinant yeast but was 210 μg per gram (dry cell weight) in the wild type. These findings indicate that the iron-carrying capacity of yeast is improved by heterologous expression of tadpole ferritin and suggests that this approach may help relieve dietary iron deficiencies in domesticated animals by the use of the engineered yeast as a feed and food supplement.

A maltose-binding protein was purified by using an amylose resin affinity column, and the binding constant was 270 nM. Since maltase activity was found only in the cytosol of fractionated cells and unlabeled glucose did not compete with radiolabeled maltose for uptake in whole cells, it appeared that maltose was transported intact. In whole-cell transport assays, the affinity for maltose was approximately 40 nM. Maltotriose and α-trehalose competitively inhibited maltose uptake in transport assays, whereas glucose, cellobiose, and a range of disaccharides had little effect.

            The current study was designed to investigate the impact of genetic heterogeneity on host immune responses to pulmonary intracellular infection by using two mouse strains of distinct genetic background, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and a model intracellular pathogen,
            <jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>
            BCG. Upon infection, compared to C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice developed an earlier response of interleukin 12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and macrophage chemoattractive protein 1, and greater neutrophilic influx to the lung by days 7 and 14. However, the level of these cytokines at days 27, 43, and 71 was much lower in BALB/c mice than in C57BL/6 mice. The magnitude of cellular responses was also much lower in the lung of BALB/c mice around day 27. Histologically, while C57BL/6 mice developed lymphocytic granulomas, BALB/c mice displayed atypical granulomas in the lung. Of importance, the level of type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 remained low and similar in the lung of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice throughout. Furthermore, lymphocytes isolated from systemic and local lymphoid tissues of infected BALB/c mice demonstrated a markedly lower antigen-specific IFN-γ recall response. While the number of mycobacterial bacilli recovered from both the lung and spleen of BALB/c mice was similar to that in C57BL/6 mice at day 14, it was higher than that in C57BL/6 mice at day 43. However, it was eventually leveled off to that in C57BL/6 counterparts later. These results suggest the following: (i) genetic heterogeneity can lead to differential innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses to primary pulmonary mycobacterial infection; (ii) it is the level of adaptive, but not innate, immune response that is critical to host resistance; and (iii) a lower type 1 immune response in BALB/c mice is not accompanied by a heightened type 2 response during pulmonary mycobacterial infection.

            . We identified a single-stranded circularized form of the RS1 element, in addition to the CTXΦ genome, in nucleic acids extracted from phage preparations of 32 out of 83 (38.5%) RS1-positive toxigenic

          <jats:p>The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a key regulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia. While the mechanism underpinning HIF activation is well understood, little is known about its resolution. Both the protein and the mRNA levels of HIF-1α (but not HIF-2α) were decreased in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia. Coincident with this, microRNA (miRNA) array analysis revealed multiple hypoxia-inducible miRNAs. Among these was miRNA-155 (miR-155), which is predicted to target HIF-1α mRNA. We confirmed the hypoxic upregulation of miR-155 in cultured cells and intestinal tissue from mice exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, a role for HIF-1α in the induction of miR-155 in hypoxia was suggested by the identification of hypoxia response elements in the miR-155 promoter and confirmed experimentally. Application of miR-155 decreased the HIF-1α mRNA, protein, and transcriptional activity in hypoxia, and neutralization of endogenous miR-155 reversed the resolution of HIF-1α stabilization and activity. Based on these data and a mathematical model of HIF-1α suppression by miR-155, we propose that miR-155 induction contributes to an isoform-specific negative-feedback loop for the resolution of HIF-1α activity in cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia, leading to oscillatory behavior of HIF-1α-dependent transcription.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Chlamydia</jats:named-content>
            causes a cleavage furrow defect that consistently results in the formation of multinucleated host cells, a phenomenon linked to tumorigenesis. Host signaling proteins essential for cleavage furrow initiation, ingression, and stabilization are displaced from one of the prospective furrowing cortices after
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Chlamydia</jats:named-content>
            infection. This protein displacement leads to the formation of a unique asymmetrical, unilateral cleavage furrow in infected human cells. The asymmetrical distribution of signaling proteins is caused by the physical presence of the
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Chlamydia</jats:named-content>
            inclusion at the cell equator. By using ingested latex beads, we demonstrate that the presence of a large vacuole at the cell equator is sufficient to cause furrow ingression failure and can lead to multinucleation. Interestingly, internalized latex beads of similar size do not localize to the cell equator as efficiently as
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Chlamydia</jats:named-content>

The structure of the formate and lactate biofilms increased in roughness, and the substratum coverage decreased, to alleviate the metabolic constraints derived from the assimilation of carbon from the substrates. Low levels of acetate promoted formate carbon assimilation and biofilm growth and increased the system's performance to levels comparable to those with acetate only. Lactate carbon assimilation also limited biofilm growth and led to the partial oxidization of lactate to acetate. However, lactate was fully oxidized in the presence of fumarate, which redirected carbon fluxes into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and by acetate-grown biofilms.

Further examination of a subset revealed biochemical defects in membrane insertion in the absence of YidC, indicating their dependence on YidC for proper membrane insertion or folding. Membrane proteins possessing an unfavorable distribution of positively charged residues were significantly more likely to depend on YidC for membrane insertion. Correcting the charge distribution of a charge-unbalanced YidC-dependent membrane protein abrogated its requirement for YidC, while perturbing the charge distribution of a charge-balanced YidC-independent membrane protein rendered it YidC dependent, demonstrating that charge distribution can be a necessary and sufficient determinant of YidC dependence. These findings provide insights into a mechanism by which YidC promotes proper membrane protein biogenesis and suggest a critical function of YidC in all organisms and organelles that express it.

            SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase and epigenetic regulator essential for normal mammalian development and homeostasis. Here we describe a human SIRT1 splice variant, designated SIRT1-Δ2/9, in which the deacetylase coding sequence is lost due to splicing between exons 2 and 9. This work aimed to determine if SIRT1-Δ2/9 is a novel functional product of the SIRT1 gene. Endogenous SIRT1-Δ2/9 protein was identified in human cell lysate by immunoblotting and splice variant-specific RNA interference (RNAi).
            <jats:italic>SIRT1</jats:italic>
            -Δ2/9 mRNA is bound by CUGBP2, which downregulates its translation. Using pulldown assays, we demonstrate that SIRT1-Δ2/9 binds p53 protein. SIRT1-Δ2/9 maintains basal p53 protein levels and supports p53 function in response to DNA damage, as evidenced by RNAi-mediated depletion of SIRT1-Δ2/9 prior to damage. In turn, basal p53 downregulates
            <jats:italic>SIRT1</jats:italic>

SIRT1 is of major therapeutic importance, and potential therapeutic drugs are screened against SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Our discovery of SIRT1-Δ2/9 identifies a new, deacetylase-independent therapeutic target for SIRT1-related diseases, including cancer.

There is, however, a lack of exercises examining the effects of desiccation on bacterial growth and survival. This particular form of antimicrobial control is especially relevant today with an increased emphasis on coughing and sneezing into one’s sleeve or a tissue, where microbes will not contaminate hands and will eventually desiccate and die (2). Desiccation can have bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects depending on the species, the material on which the organism has desiccated, and the length of time. The absence of water can damage many cellular components, including enzymes, nucleic acids, and cell membranes (1). However, many prokaryotes have some degree of resistance to desiccation, with Escherichia coli surviving around 24 hours and Bacillus species surviving upwards of 300 years, though these numbers can vary due to a number of confounding factors (5). Some of these factors include the method by which desiccation occurred, whether desiccation occurred in a natural or laboratory situation, and the species itself (5). To address the effects of desiccation on bacterial growth and survival, a short, simple exercise was developed. By inoculating various materials with bacterial cultures and allowing them to air-dry for 24 hours, students can visualize the effects of desiccation by analyzing the growth, or lack thereof, when organisms are transferred to nutrient agar plates. This exercise has been used in a health professions microbiology course as well as a microbiology course for biology and biochemistry majors.

            BST2/tetherin inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from cells. Primate lentiviruses have evolved specific antagonists (Vpu, Nef, and Env). Here we characterized tetherin proteins of species representing both branches of the order Carnivora. Comparison of tiger and cat (Feliformia) to dog and ferret (Caniformia) genes demonstrated that the tiger and cat share a start codon mutation that truncated most of the tetherin cytoplasmic tail early in the Feliformia lineage (19 of 27 amino acids, including the dual tyrosine motif). Alpha interferon (IFN-α) induced tetherin and blocked feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) replication in lymphoid and nonlymphoid feline cells. Budding of bald FIV and HIV particles was blocked by carnivore tetherins. However, infectious FIV particles were resistant, and spreading FIV replication was uninhibited. Antagonism mapped to the envelope glycoprotein (Env), which rescued FIV from carnivore tetherin restriction when expressed in
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            but, in contrast to known antagonists, did not rescue noncognate particles. Also unlike the primate lentiviral antagonists, but similar to the Ebola virus glycoprotein, FIV Env did not reduce intracellular or cell surface tetherin levels. Furthermore, FIV-enveloped FIV particles actually required tetherin for optimal release from cells. The results show that FIV Envs mediate a distinctive tetherin evasion. Well adapted to a phylogenetically ancient tetherin tail truncation in the Felidae, it requires functional virion incorporation of Env, and it shields the budding particle without downregulating plasma membrane tetherin. Moreover, FIV has evolved dependence on this protein: particles containing FIV Env need tetherin for optimal release from the cell, while Env

Also unlike other retroviral antagonists, but similar to Ebola virus Env, it does not act by downregulating or degrading tetherin. FIV Env might exclude tetherin locally or direct assembly to tetherin-negative membrane domains. Other distinctive features are apparent, including evidence that this virus evolved an equilibrium in which tetherin is both restriction factor and cofactor, as FIV requires tetherin for optimal particle release.

            DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils in the genomes of eubacteria. Fluoroquinolones (FQs), successful as drugs clinically, target the enzyme to trap the gyrase-DNA complex, leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in the genome. Mycobacteria are less susceptible to commonly used FQs. However, an 8-methoxy-substituted FQ, moxifloxacin (MFX), is a potent antimycobacterial, and a higher susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to MFX has been demonstrated. Although several models explain the mechanism of FQ action and gyrase-DNA-FQ interaction, the basis for the differential susceptibility of mycobacterial gyrase to various FQs is not understood. We have addressed the basis of the differential susceptibility of the gyrase and revisited the mode of action of FQs. We demonstrate that FQs bind both

We found that the large majority of predicted human T cell epitopes were confined to the conserved PE domain and experimentally confirmed the antigenicity of this domain in tuberculosis patients. In contrast, despite being genetically diverse, the PGRS domains harbored few predicted T cell epitopes. These results indicate that human T cell recognition is not a significant force driving sequence diversity in

          <jats:p>Ubiquitinated proteins aggregate upon proteasome failure, and the aggregates are transported to the aggresome. In aggresomes, protein aggregates are actively degraded by the autophagy-lysosome pathway, but why targeting the aggresome promotes degradation of aggregated species is currently unknown. Here we report that the important factor in this process is clustering of lysosomes around the aggresome via a novel mechanism. Proteasome inhibition causes formation of a zone around the centrosome where microtubular transport of lysosomes is suppressed, resulting in their entrapment and accumulation. Microtubule-dependent transport of other organelles, including autophagosomes, mitochondria, and endosomes, is also blocked in this entrapment zone (E-zone), while movement of organelles at the cell periphery remains unaffected. Following the whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for proteins involved in aggresome formation, we defined the pathway that regulates formation of the E-zone, including the Stk11 protein kinase, the Usp9x deubiquitinating enzyme, and their substrate kinase MARK4. Therefore, upon proteasome failure, targeting of aggregated proteins of the aggresome is coordinated with lysosome positioning around this body to facilitate degradation of the abnormal species.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

            The anti-σ factor NepR plays a central role in regulation of the general stress response (GSR) in alphaproteobacteria. This small protein has two known interaction partners: its cognate extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor and the anti-anti-σ factor, PhyR. Stress-dependent phosphorylation of PhyR initiates a protein partner switch that promotes phospho-PhyR binding to NepR, which frees ECF σ to activate transcription of genes required for cell survival under adverse or fluctuating conditions. We have defined key functional roles for structured and intrinsically disordered domains of

            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            and that this effect requires the structured and disordered domains of NepR. This result provides evidence for an additional layer of GSR regulation in which NepR directly influences activation of its binding partner, PhyR, as an anti-anti-σ factor. We conclude that structured and intrinsically disordered domains of NepR coordinately control multiple functions in the GSR signaling pathway, including core protein partner switch interactions and pathway activation by phosphorylation.

            Anti-σ factors are key molecular participants in a range of adaptive responses in bacteria. The anti-σ factor NepR plays a vital role in a multiprotein partner switch that governs general stress response (GSR) transcription in alphaproteobacteria. We have defined conserved and unconserved features of NepR structure that determine its function as an anti-σ factor and uncovered a functional role for intrinsically disordered regions of NepR in partner binding events required for GSR activation. We further demonstrate a novel function for NepR as an enhancer of PhyR phosphorylation; this activity also requires the disordered domains of NepR. Our results provide evidence for a new layer of GSR regulatory control in which NepR directly modulates PhyR phosphorylation and, hence, activation of the GSR.

            To understand the interplay between host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses and the mechanisms by which HIV-1 evades them, we studied viral evolutionary patterns associated with host CTL responses in six linked transmission pairs. HIV-1 sequences corresponding to full-length p17 and p24
            <jats:italic>gag</jats:italic>
            were generated by 454 pyrosequencing for all pairs near the time of transmission, and seroconverting partners were followed for a median of 847 days postinfection. T-cell responses were screened by gamma interferon/interleukin-2 (IFN-γ/IL-2) FluoroSpot using autologous peptide sets reflecting any Gag variant present in at least 5% of sequence reads in the individual's viral population. While we found little evidence for the occurrence of CTL reversions, CTL escape processes were found to be highly dynamic, with multiple epitope variants emerging simultaneously. We found a correlation between epitope entropy and the number of epitope variants per response (
            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>
            = 0.43;
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            = 0.05). In cases in which multiple escape mutations developed within a targeted epitope, a variant with no fitness cost became fixed in the viral population. When multiple mutations within an epitope achieved fitness-balanced escape, these escape mutants were each maintained in the viral population. Additional mutations found to confer escape but undetected in viral populations incurred high fitness costs, suggesting that functional constraints limit the available sites tolerable to escape mutations. These results further our understanding of the impact of CTL escape and reversion from the founder virus in HIV infection and contribute to the identification of immunogenic Gag regions most vulnerable to a targeted T-cell attack.

            Rapid diversification of the viral population is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection, and understanding the selective forces driving the emergence of viral variants can provide critical insight into the interplay between host immune responses and viral evolution. We used deep sequencing to comprehensively follow viral evolution over time in six linked HIV transmission pairs. We then mapped T-cell responses to explore if mutations arose due to adaption to the host and found that escape processes were often highly dynamic, with multiple mutations arising within targeted epitopes. When we explored the impact of these mutations on replicative capacity, we found that dynamic escape processes only resolve with the selection of mutations that conferred escape with no fitness cost to the virus. These results provide further understanding of the complicated viral-host interactions that occur during early HIV-1 infection and may help inform the design of future vaccine immunogens.

          <jats:p>Gastrointestinal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among young children and immunocompromised patients. Diarrhea may result from infection with a variety of microbial pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Historically, the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea has been made using microscopy, antigen tests, culture, and real-time PCR. A combination of these traditional tests is often required due to the inability to distinguish between infectious etiologies based on the clinical presentation alone. Recently, several multiplex molecular assays have been developed for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens directly from clinical stool samples. These panels allow for the detection and identification of up to 20 pathogens in as little as 1 h. This review will focus on the multiplex molecular panels that have received clearance from the FDA for the diagnosis of diarrheal disease and will highlight issues related to test performance, result interpretation, and cost-effectiveness of these new molecular diagnostic tools.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA

Auxotrophies for alanine, asparagine, or proline attenuated intracellular replication in HeLa cells, while aspartate, asparagine, or proline auxotrophies attenuated intracellular replication in RAW264.7 macrophages. The different patterns of intracellular attenuation of alanine- or aspartate-auxotrophic strains support distinct nutritional conditions in HeLa cells and RAW264.7 macrophages.

GlcNAc triggers the upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis genes, alterations of mitochondrial metabolism, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by rapid cell death via both apoptotic and necrotic mechanisms. Multiple pathways, including the conserved cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling and GlcNAc catabolic pathways, are involved in GICD.

We assessed the impact of 10 published B*13-associated polymorphisms in Gag, Pol, and Nef, in 23 biologically relevant combinations, on HIV-1 replication capacity and Nef-mediated reduction of cell surface CD4 and HLA class I expression. Mutations were engineered into HIV-1

When tested individually, only Gag-I147L and Gag-I437L incurred replicative costs (5% and 17%, respectively), consistent with prior reports.

Single Nef mutations did not affect CD4 or HLA downregulation; however, the Nef double mutant E24Q-Q107R showed 40% impairment in HLA downregulation with no evidence of Nef stability defects.

            Protective effects of HLA-B*13 on HIV-1 disease progression are mediated in part by fitness costs of CTL escape mutations in conserved Gag epitopes, but other mechanisms remain incompletely known. We extend our knowledge of the impact of B*13-driven escape on HIV-1 replication by identifying Gag-K436R as a compensatory mutation for the fitness-costly Gag-I437L. We also identify Gag-I147L, the most rapidly and commonly selected B*13-driven substitution in HIV-1, as a putative C-terminal anchor residue mutation in a novel B*13 epitope. Most notably, we identify a novel escape-driven fitness defect: B*13-driven substitutions E24Q and Q107R in Nef, when present together, substantially impair this protein's ability to downregulate HLA class I. This, in turn, increases the visibility of infected cells to HIV-specific T cells. Our results suggest that B*13-associated escape mutations impair HIV-1 replication by two distinct mechanisms, that is, by reducing Gag fitness and dampening Nef immune evasion function.

            Human cerebral malaria (HCM) is a serious complication of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Plasmodium falciparum</jats:named-content>
            infection. The most severe outcomes for patients include coma, permanent neurological deficits, and death. Recently, a large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in humans identified brain swelling as the most prominent predictor of fatal HCM. Therefore, in this study, we sought to define the mechanism controlling brain edema through the use of the murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model. Specifically, we investigated the ability of CD8 T cells to initiate brain edema during ECM. We determined that areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability colocalized with a reduction of the cerebral endothelial cell tight-junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. Furthermore, through small-animal MRI, we analyzed edema and vascular leakage. Using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, we determined that vascular permeability is not homogeneous but rather confined to specific regions of the brain. Our findings show that BBB permeability was localized within the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and lateral ventricle. Concurrently with the initiation of vascular permeability, T2-weighted MRI revealed edema and brain swelling. Importantly, ablation of the cytolytic effector molecule perforin fully protected against vascular permeability and edema. Furthermore, perforin production specifically by CD8 T cells was required to cause fatal edema during ECM. We propose that CD8 T cells initiate BBB breakdown through perforin-mediated disruption of tight junctions. In turn, leakage from the vasculature into the parenchyma causes brain swelling and edema. This results in a breakdown of homeostatic maintenance that likely contributes to ECM pathology.

          <jats:p>Central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) takes three clinical forms: meningitis (TBM), intracranial tuberculoma, and spinal arachnoiditis. TBM predominates in the western world and presents as a subacute to chronic meningitis syndrome with a prodrome of malaise, fever, and headache progressing to altered mentation and focal neurologic signs, followed by stupor, coma, and death within five to eight weeks of onset. The CSF formula typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and low glucose and high protein concentrations. Diagnosis rests on serial samples of CSF for smear and culture, combined with CSF PCR. Brain CT and MRI aid in diagnosis, assessment for complications, and monitoring of the clinical course. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of TBM. Vasculitis leading to infarcts in the basal ganglia occurs commonly and is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Treatment is most effective when started in the early stages of disease, and should be initiated promptly on the basis of strong clinical suspicion without waiting for laboratory confirmation. The initial 4 drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) covers the possibility of infection with a resistant strain, maximizes antimicrobial impact, and reduces the likelihood of emerging resistance on therapy. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in all but late stage disease.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

Expressed in developing bradyzoites still undergoing division, AP2IX-4 may serve as a useful marker in the study of transitional forms of the parasite.

          <jats:p>In HIV-infected individuals, paradoxical reactions after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with a variety of underlying infections and have been called the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In cases of IRIS associated with tuberculosis (TB), two distinct patterns of disease are recognized: (i) the progression of subclinical TB to clinical disease after the initiation of ART, referred to as unmasking, and (ii) the progression or appearance of new clinical and/or radiographic disease in patients with previously recognized TB after the initiation of ART, the classic or “paradoxical” TB-IRIS. IRIS can potentially occur in all granulomatous diseases, not just infectious ones. All granulomatous diseases are thought to result from interplay of inflammatory cells and mediators. One of the inflammatory cells thought to be integral to the development of the granuloma is the CD4 T lymphocyte. Therefore, HIV-infected patients with noninfectious granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis may also develop IRIS reactions. Here, we describe IRIS in HIV-infected patients with TB and sarcoidosis and review the basic clinical and immunological aspects of these phenomena.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

            bacteria, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been recognized as important resistance determinants against antimicrobial peptides. Together with neighboring two-component systems (TCSs), which regulate their expression, they form specific detoxification modules. Both the transport permease and sensor kinase components show unusual domain architecture: the permeases contain a large extracellular domain, while the sensor kinases lack an obvious input domain. One of the best-characterized examples is the bacitracin resistance module BceRS-BceAB of
            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" content-type=""genus-species"" xlink:type=""simple"">Bacillus subtilis</jats:named-content>
            . Strikingly, in this system, the ABC transporter and TCS have an absolute mutual requirement for each other in both sensing of and resistance to bacitracin, suggesting a novel mode of signal transduction in which the transporter constitutes the actual sensor. We identified over 250 such BceAB-like ABC transporters in the current databases. They occurred almost exclusively in

            bacteria, and 80% of the transporters were associated with a BceRS-like TCS. Phylogenetic analyses of the permease and sensor kinase components revealed a tight evolutionary correlation. Our findings suggest a direct regulatory interaction between the ABC transporters and TCSs, mediating communication between both components. Based on their observed coclustering and conservation of response regulator binding sites, we could identify putative corresponding two-component systems for transporters lacking a regulatory system in their immediate neighborhood. Taken together, our results show that these types of ABC transporters and TCSs have coevolved to form self-sufficient detoxification modules against antimicrobial peptides, widely distributed among

          <jats:p>Rhinoviral infection is an important trigger of acute inflammatory exacerbations in patients with underlying airway disease. We have previously established that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is central in the communication between epithelial cells and monocytes during the initiation of inflammation. In this study we explored the roles of IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the responses of airway cells to rhinovirus-1B (RV-1B) and further determined how responses to RV-1B were modified in a model of bacterial coinfection. Our results revealed that IL-1β dramatically potentiated RV-1B-induced proinflammatory responses, and while monocytes did not directly amplify responses to RV-1B alone, they played an important role in the responses observed with our coinfection model. MyD88 is the essential signaling adapter for IL-1β and most Toll-like receptors. To examine the role of MyD88 in more detail, we created stable MyD88 knockdown epithelial cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to MyD88. We determined that IL-1β/MyD88 plays a role in regulating RV-1B replication and the inflammatory response to viral infection of airway cells. These results identify central roles for IL-1β and its signaling pathways in the production of CXCL8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, in viral infection.

          <jats:p>The generation of an effective immune response against an infection while also limiting tissue damage requires a delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has potent immunosuppressive effects and is essential for regulation of immune responses. However, the immunosuppressive properties of IL-10 can also be exploited by pathogens to facilitate their own survival. In this minireview, we discuss the role of IL-10 in modulating intracellular bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections. Using information from several different infection models, we bring together and highlight some common pathways for IL-10 regulation and function that cannot be fully appreciated by studies of a single pathogen.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA

The 33 mutants spanned an activity range between ∼0.6% and 19.6-fold of the wild-type promoter activity with an almost linear fluorescence intensity distribution. After an extensive characterization of the library, the broader applicability of the results obtained with the yEGFP reporter was confirmed using two additional reporters (β-galactosidase and methionine adenosyltransferase [MAT]) at the transcription and enzyme activity levels. Furthermore, the utility of the promoter library was tested by investigating the influence of heterologous MAT gene expression levels on cell growth and

The extensive characterization of the promoter strength enabled identification of the optimal MAT activity (around 1.05 U/mg of protein) to obtain maximal volumetric SAM production. The promoter library permits precise control of gene expression and quantitative assessment that correlates gene expression level with physiologic parameters.

            Influenza virus infections are known to persist longer in patients with underlying diseases, including respiratory tract diseases, and tend to become complicated by secondary influenza-associated infections, such as pneumonia. To assess the efficacy and safety of the novel anti-influenza virus drug peramivir in high-risk patients, we conducted a clinical trial of patients with diabetes or chronic respiratory tract diseases and patients being treated with drugs that suppress immune function. In this multicenter, uncontrolled, randomized, double-blind study, peramivir was intravenously administered at 300 or 600 mg/day for 1 to 5 days, as needed. Efficacy was investigated in 37 patients (300 mg,

            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 19 patients). The median durations of influenza illness were 68.6 h (90% confidence interval, 41.5 to 113.4 h) overall, 114.4 h (90% confidence interval, 40.2 to 235.3 h) in the 300-mg group, and 42.3 h (90% confidence interval, 30.0 to 82.7 h) in the 600-mg group. The hazard ratio for the 600-mg group compared to the 300-mg group was 0.497 (90% confidence interval, 0.251 to 0.984), and the duration of influenza illness was significantly shorter in the 600-mg group than in the 300-mg group. Among the 42 patients in the safety analysis set, adverse events occurred in 73.8% and adverse drug reactions in 33.3%. No adverse events were particularly problematic clinically, and all patients recovered quickly from all events. The measured blood drug concentrations showed no tendency toward accumulation. Drug accumulation with repeated doses was thus considered to be of little concern. Intravenous peramivir appears to offer a potentially useful treatment for high-risk patients in the future.

            With the recent rise of alternative instructional methodologies such as flipped classrooms and active learning, many core concepts are being introduced outside of the classroom prior to scheduled class meeting times. One popular means for external concept introduction in many undergraduate biology courses is the use of stand-alone online learning modules. Using a group of four large introductory biology course sections, we investigate the use of a stand-alone online learning module developed using animations from Virtual Cell Animation Collection as a resource for the introduction of cellular respiration concepts outside of the classroom. Results from four sections of introductory biology (

            Despite significant advances in health care, outbreaks of infections by enteroviruses (EVs) continue to plague the Asia-Pacific region every year. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), for which there are currently no therapeutics. Here, we report two new antibodies, A9 and D6, that potently neutralize EV71. A9 exhibited a 50% neutralizing concentration (neut
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) value of 0.1 nM against EV71, which was 10-fold lower than that observed for D6. Investigation into the mechanisms of neutralization revealed that binding of A9 to EV71 blocks receptor binding but also destabilizes and damages the virus capsid structure. In contrast, D6 destabilizes the capsid only slightly but interferes more potently with the attachment of the virus to the host cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of A9 and D6 bound with EV71 shed light on the locations and nature of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies. Although some regions of the epitopes recognized by the two antibodies overlap, there are differences that give rise to dissimilarities in potency as well as in the mechanisms of neutralization. Interestingly, the overlapping regions of the epitopes encompass the site that the virus uses to bind SCARB2, explaining the reason for the observed blocking of the virus-receptor interaction by the two antibodies. We also identified structural elements that might play roles in modulating the stability of the EV71 particles, including particle integrity. The molecular features of the A9 and D6 epitopes unveiled in this study open up new avenues for rationally designing antiviral drugs.

            During the course of viral infections, the human body produces neutralizing antibodies which play a defining role in clearing the virus. From this study, we report two new, highly potent neutralizing antibodies, A9 and D6, against enterovirus 71 (EV71), the causative agent of HFMD. Both antibodies prevent the virus from entering the host cell, a step that is important for establishing a successful infection. A9 destabilizes and damages the virus capsid that forms an outer protective covering around the genome of the virus, while also interfering with virus attachment to the host cells. In contrast, D6 only prevents binding of the virus to its receptor(s). The mechanism of neutralization of A9 is unique and has not been observed before for neutralizing antibodies targeting EVs. The two antibodies that we are reporting in this study have potential to be developed into much-needed therapeutic interventions for treatment of HFMD, outbreaks of which are reported every year in the Asia-Pacific region.

The riboswitch monitors the aminoacylation status of the tRNA to induce expression of the regulated downstream gene(s) at the level of transcription antitermination or derepression of translation initiation in response to reduced tRNA charging via stabilization of an antiterminator or antisequestrator. Recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed new features of tRNA recognition that extend beyond the initially identified Watson-Crick base-pairing of a codon-like sequence in the riboswitch with the tRNA anticodon, and residues in the antiterminator or antisequestrator with the tRNA acceptor end. These studies have revealed new tRNA contacts and new modes of riboswitch function and ligand recognition that expand our understanding of RNA-RNA recognition and the biological roles of tRNA.

            to trigger pyroptosis. Since the mammalian sterol cholesterol triggers NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, we hypothesized that ergosterol may also do so. Consistent with that hypothesis, ergosterol-containing liposomes but not ergosterol-free liposomes induce pyroptosis. Cell wall mannoproteins directly bind ergosterol, and we found that Dan1, an ergosterol receptor mannoprotein, as well as specific mannosyltransferases, is required for pyroptosis, suggesting that cell wall-associated ergosterol may mediate the process. Taken together, these data indicate that ergosterol, like mammalian cholesterol, plays a direct role in yeast-mediated pyroptosis.

We also show that a key component of the fungal plasma membrane, ergosterol, directly triggers pyroptosis. Ergosterol is also present in the fungal cell wall, most likely associated with mannoproteins, and is increased in hyphal cells compared to yeast cells. Our data indicate that specific mannoproteins are required for pyroptosis. This is consistent with a potential mechanism whereby ergosterol present in the outer mannoprotein layer of the cell wall is accessible to the macrophage-mediated process. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that ergosterol plays a direct role in the host-pathogen interactions of fungi.

Here, we compared the

HAECs treated with β-toxin displayed granular membrane morphology not seen in treatment with the SMase-deficient mutant. The altered morphology resulted in two possibly separable activities, cell rounding and redistribution of cell membranes into granules, which were not the result of endosome production from the Golgi apparatus or lysosomes. β-Toxin directly aggregated rabbit platelets via SMase activity.

Considering the strong association and established contribution of β-toxin in animal models of IE, determining how β-toxin directly affects human cell types, including endothelial cells and platelets, is important. In this study, we demonstrate that β-toxin functions to modulate endothelial cells and platelets by both toxin sphingomyelinase and biofilm ligase activities.

These columns are self-sufficient ecosystems that allow researchers to study bacterial populations under specified environmental conditions. Non-science majors identified phototrophic bacteria enriched in the column by analyzing the signature chlorophyll absorption spectra whereas science majors used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the general bacterial diversity. Students then compiled their results and worked together to generate lab reports with their final conclusions identifying the microorganisms present in their column. Surveys and lab reports were utilized to evaluate the learning objectives of this activity. In pre-surveys, nonmajors’ and majors’ answers diverged considerably, with majors providing responses that were more accurate and more in line with the working definition of collaboration. In post-surveys, the answers between majors and nonmajors converged, with both groups providing accurate responses.

Bioinformatics, which had the highest ratio of publications produced, was predicted to grow between 77% and 93% by 2025 according to the model. Due to the large number of publications produced in bioinformatics, which nearly matches the number published in biochemistry, it can be inferred that bioinformatics is almost equal in significance to biochemistry.

            Broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are used clinically as anticancer agents, and more isoform-selective HDACi have been sought to modulate other conditions, including chronic inflammatory diseases. Mouse studies suggest that HDACi downregulate immune responses and may compromise host defense. However, their effects on human macrophage antimicrobial responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that overnight pretreatment of human macrophages with HDACi prior to challenge with

            results in significantly reduced intramacrophage bacterial loads, which likely reflect the fact that this treatment regime impairs phagocytosis. In contrast, cotreatment of human macrophages with HDACi at the time of bacterial challenge did not impair phagocytosis; instead, HDACi cotreatment actually promoted clearance of intracellular

            . Mechanistically, treatment of human macrophages with HDACi at the time of bacterial infection enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation by these cells. The capacity of HDACi to promote the clearance of intracellular bacteria from human macrophages was abrogated when cells were pretreated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos, which perturbs mitochondrial function. The HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin A promoted bacterial clearance from human macrophages, whereas the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275, which inhibits HDAC1 to -3, had no effect on intracellular bacterial loads. These data are consistent with HDAC6 and/or related HDACs constraining mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production from human macrophages during bacterial challenge. Our findings suggest that, whereas long-term HDACi treatment regimes may potentially compromise host defense, selective HDAC inhibitors may have applications in treating acute bacterial infections.

            Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 remain major human pathogens despite the development of anti-HSV therapeutics as some of the first antiviral drugs. Current therapies are incompletely effective and frequently drive the evolution of drug-resistant mutants. We recently determined that certain natural troponoid compounds such as β-thujaplicinol readily suppress HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication. Here, we screened 26 synthetic α-hydroxytropolones with the goals of determining a preliminary structure-activity relationship for the α-hydroxytropolone pharmacophore and providing a starting point for future optimization studies. Twenty-five compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at 50 μM, and 10 compounds inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 5 μM, with similar inhibition patterns and potencies against both viruses being observed. The two most powerful inhibitors shared a common biphenyl side chain, were capable of inhibiting HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) of 81 to 210 nM, and also strongly inhibited acyclovir-resistant mutants. Moderate to low cytotoxicity was observed for all compounds (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ] of 50 to &gt;100 μM). Therapeutic indexes ranged from &gt;170 to &gt;1,200. These data indicate that troponoids and specifically α-hydroxytropolones are a promising lead scaffold for development as anti-HSV drugs provided that toxicity can be further minimized. Troponoid drugs are envisioned to be employed alone or in combination with existing nucleos(t)ide analogs to suppress HSV replication far enough to prevent viral shedding and to limit the development of or treat nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant mutants.

To gain insights into the molecular basis of acute Lyme disease and the ensuing development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted a longitudinal transcriptome study of 29 Lyme disease patients (and 13 matched controls) enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed for up to 6 months. The differential gene expression signature of Lyme disease following the acute phase of infection persisted for at least 3 weeks and had fewer than 44% differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in common with other infectious or noninfectious syndromes. Early Lyme disease prior to antibiotic therapy was characterized by marked upregulation of Toll-like receptor signaling but lack of activation of the inflammatory T-cell apoptotic and B-cell developmental pathways seen in other acute infectious syndromes. Six months after completion of therapy, Lyme disease patients were found to have 31 to 60% of their pathways in common with three different immune-mediated chronic diseases. No differential gene expression signature was observed between Lyme disease patients with resolved illness to those with persistent symptoms at 6 months post-treatment. The identification of a sustained differential gene expression signature in Lyme disease suggests that a panel of selected human host-based biomarkers may address the need for sensitive clinical diagnostics during the “window period” of infection prior to the appearance of a detectable antibody response and may also inform the development of new therapeutic targets.

            Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States, and some patients report lingering symptoms lasting months to years despite antibiotic treatment. To better understand the role of the human host response in acute Lyme disease and the development of post-treatment symptoms, we conducted the first longitudinal gene expression (transcriptome) study of patients enrolled at the time of diagnosis and followed up for up to 6 months after treatment. Importantly, we found that the gene expression signature of early Lyme disease is distinct from that of other acute infectious diseases and persists for at least 3 weeks following infection. This study also uncovered multiple previously undescribed pathways and genes that may be useful in the future as human host biomarkers for diagnosis and that constitute potential targets for the development of new therapies.

We developed a new proteomics approach to identify bacterial proteins that are involved in the attachment of Bcc bacteria to lung epithelial cells.

            BSI were identified. Of these, 34 had received fluconazole and 35 had received an echinocandin/L-AmB-based regimen. Patients in the echinocandin/L-AmB group had poorer baseline clinical status than did those in the fluconazole group. Patients in the fluconazole group were more frequently (55.9% versus 28.6%) and much earlier (median time, 3 versus 7 days) switched to another antifungal regimen. Overall, 14-day mortality was 13% (9/69) and treatment failure 34.8% (24/69), with no significant differences between the groups. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for baseline characteristics by propensity score, fluconazole use was not associated with an unfavorable evolution (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for 14-day mortality, 1.16, with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.22 to 6.17; adjusted OR for treatment failure, 0.83, with 95% CI of 0.27 to 2.61). In conclusion, initial fluconazole treatment was not associated with a poorer outcome than that obtained with echinocandins/L-AmB regimens in patients with

          <jats:p>
            Several pathogens have evolved to infect host cells from within, which requires subversion of many host intracellular processes. In the case of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, adaptation to an intracellular life cycle relies largely on the activity of type III secretion systems (T3SSs), an apparatus used to deliver effector proteins into the host cell, from where these effectors regulate important cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton reorganization, and the innate immune response. Each bacterium is equipped with a unique suite of these T3SS effectors, which aid in the development of an individual intracellular lifestyle for their respective pathogens. Some bacteria adapt to reside and propagate within a customized vacuole, while others establish a replicative niche in the host cytosol. In this article, we review the mechanisms by which T3SS effectors contribute to these different lifestyles. To illustrate the formation of a vacuolar and a cytosolic lifestyle, we discuss the intracellular habitats of the enteric pathogens

The enzymatic capability to process phytate has been reported for a limited number of protein families. This might be due to the almost exclusive use of proteins derived from individual microorganisms to analyze phytase activity. With such a restriction, the study of the complexity and diversity of the phytases remains incomplete.

          <jats:p>In addition to SecA of the general Sec system, many Gram-positive bacteria, including mycobacteria, express SecA2, a second, transport-associated ATPase. SecA2s can be subdivided into two mechanistically distinct types: (i) SecA2s that are part of the accessory Sec (aSec) system, a specialized transporter mediating the export of a family of serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins that function as adhesins, and (ii) SecA2s that are part of multisubstrate systems, in which SecA2 interacts with components of the general Sec system, specifically the SecYEG channel, to export multiple types of substrates. Found mainly in streptococci and staphylococci, the aSec system also contains SecY2 and novel accessory Sec proteins (Asps) that are required for optimal export. Asp2 also acetylates glucosamine residues on the SRR domains of the substrate during transport. Targeting of the SRR substrate to SecA2 and the aSec translocon is mediated by a specialized signal peptide. Multisubstrate SecA2 systems are present in mycobacteria, corynebacteria, listeriae, clostridia, and some bacillus species. Although most substrates for this SecA2 have canonical signal peptides that are required for export, targeting to SecA2 appears to depend on structural features of the mature protein. The feature of the mature domains of these proteins that renders them dependent on SecA2 for export may be their potential to fold in the cytoplasm. The discovery of aSec and multisubstrate SecA2 systems expands our appreciation of the diversity of bacterial export pathways. Here we present our current understanding of the mechanisms of each of these SecA2 systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

We monitored responses to single chromosomal breaks in trypanosomes using a DNA-binding protein that, in response to DNA damage, forms nuclear foci visible using a microscope. Surprisingly, and unlike what is seen in mammalian cells, these foci persist while cells continue to divide. We also demonstrate chromosome replication even when one chromosome is broken.

            Malaria is a vector-borne disease that involves multiple parasite species in a variety of ecological settings. However, the parasite species causing the disease, the prevalence of subclinical infections, the emergence of drug resistance, the scale-up of interventions, and the ecological factors affecting malaria transmission, among others, are aspects that vary across areas where malaria is endemic. Such complexities have propelled the study of parasite genetic diversity patterns in the context of epidemiologic investigations. Importantly, molecular studies indicate that the time and spatial distribution of malaria cases reflect epidemiologic processes that cannot be fully understood without characterizing the evolutionary forces shaping parasite population genetic patterns.

At present, there is no effective treatment to eradicate the virus from patients. HBV in chronic carriers does not exist as a single homogeneous population. The most frequent naturally occurring mutation in HBV core protein occurs at amino acid 97, changing an isoleucine to leucine (I97L). One dogma in the field is that only virions containing a mature genome are preferentially secreted into the medium. Here, we demonstrated that mutant I97L can secrete immature genome in mice. Although viral DNA of mutant I97L with immature genome is less persistent than wild-type HBV in time course experiments, viral DNA of mutant P130T with genome hypermaturation, surprisingly, is more persistent. Therefore, virion secretion regulated by genome maturity could influence viral persistence. It remains an open issue whether virion secretion could be a drug target for HBV therapy.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

Here, we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that, prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands and, after receipt, by washing candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent.

After 7 days of administration of a cholesterol-enriched diet (0.50% [wt/vol]) or a regular rabbit diet, each rabbit was administered a single intravenous bolus of Doc-AmB (

            = 10) (1.0 mg/kg of body weight) daily for 7 consecutive days (a total of eight doses). Blood samples were obtained daily before and 24 h after the administration of each dose and serially thereafter following the administration of the last dose for the assessment of pharmacokinetics in plasma, kidney toxicity, plasma lipoprotein levels, and drug distribution in tissue. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood following the administration of ABLC were also determined in rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched and regular diets (
            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>
            = 3 each group). Before drug treatment, cholesterol-fed rabbits demonstrated marked increases in total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol levels in plasma compared with the levels in rabbits on a regular diet. No significant differences in total plasma triglyceride levels were observed. Significant increases in plasma creatinine levels were observed in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) and rabbits fed a regular diet (
            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
            &lt; 0.05) when administered AmB. However, the magnitude of this increase was twofold greater in rabbits fed a regular diet than in rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. An increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed only in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered ABLC. The pharmacokinetics of AmB were significantly altered in rabbits on a cholesterol-enriched diet administered Doc-AmB or ABLC compared to those in rabbits on a regular diet administered each of these compounds. The pharmacokinetics of AmB in blood were significantly different following ABLC administration but not following Doc-AmB administration in both rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched diets and rabbits fed regular diets compared to their corresponding pharmacokinetics in plasma. An increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the TRL fraction when Doc-AmB was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet than when it was administered to rabbits fed a regular diet. Furthermore, an increased percentage of AmB was recovered in the LDL and TRL fractions when ABLC was administered to rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet rabbits fed a regular diet.

According to their phenotypes, including quantitative differences in biofilm production in different growth media, in the amount of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) produced, in the hemagglutination titers, and in the altered colony morphology, the mutants could be separated into four phenotypic classes corresponding with the genetic classes.

            Previous studies have suggested that interleukin-4 (IL-4) has a protective effect in host defense to
            <jats:italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            infection, both in limiting the severity of arthritis and in controlling spirochete numbers in tissues, and a mapping study revealed suggestive linkage to a cluster of genes on mouse chromosome 11, including the genes for IL-4 and IL-13. In contrast, other studies have questioned the importance of IL-4. In this study the involvement of IL-4 in murine Lyme disease was examined in C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice with targeted disruptions in the IL-4 gene, the IL-4Rα chain gene, or both. A spectrum of arthritis severity was seen in BALB/cJ mice, and ablation of IL-4, IL-4Rα, or both had no effect on the overall severity of arthritis as determined by joint swelling and histopathology. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice exhibited mild to moderate arthritis, and ablation of IL-4 again had no effect on arthritis severity. IL-4- and IL-4Rα-deficient mice produced extremely low levels of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and showed increased production of IgG2b. This shift in immunoglobulin isotype had no effect on the host's ability to control spirochete growth in either strain of mouse, as determined by PCR detection of
            <jats:italic>B. burgdorferi</jats:italic>
            DNA from heart and ankle tissues. In summary, the IL-4-IL-4Rα pathway, including IL-13 signaling, neither limits arthritis severity nor is required for control of spirochete growth during

          <jats:p>In renal bacterial infections granulocytes are of major importance in the primary immune defense against invading pathogens. However, the mechanisms of granulocytic activation in renal interstitial invasion have not been clarified. Renal tubular epithelial cell mechanisms inducing granulocytic activation and bacterial killing may include tubular cell expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), a urinary protein that is known to enhance cytokine expression in monocytes. We studied the role of THP in granulocytic activation. A strong binding of THP to human granulocytes was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Urinary THP and supernatants of THP-expressing cultured tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) enhanced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression by human granulocytes. Renal tubular cells growing polarized on polycarbonate membranes were used to study apical versus basal THP expression. By electron microscopy THP immunoreactivity was exclusively found on the apical surfaces of tubular cells and was absent on the basolateral cell membrane. In the apical cell culture compartment we found significantly more stimulatory activity for granulocytic IL-8 expression. CD62L, a selectin less expressed in activated granulocytes, was decreased in granulocytes incubated with urinary THP and in supernatants of THP-producing renal tubular cells but not in supernatants from THP-negative cells. Again, the effect on CD62L expression was found only in apical culture media and was absent in the basal compartment. In summary our data give evidence that renal tubular cell THP expression may be relevant in kidney diseases since THP is a potent activator of human granulocytes. The regulation of apical versus basal THP expression and release in vivo may be crucial in the induction of the inflammatory response, e.g., in bacterial renal diseases.</jats:p>",en,Infect Immun,NA

The presence of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses suggested a mixed Th1- and Th2-type response; there was no correlation between subclass reactivity and the disease course. The recombinant papLe22 specifically activated interleukin-10 production by VL patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at diagnosis and after treatment-induced cure, indicating its contribution to VL pathogenesis and concomitant immunosuppression and its potential role in the reactivation of latent parasites. As a dominant immunogen, papLe22 might be used as a vaccine component, provided that the vaccination protocol directs the response toward the Th1 pattern.

The only combinations of toxin proteins causing cell cycle arrest were the presence of all three Cdt proteins and the combination of CdtB and CdtC. A similar experimental protocol was used to determine if recombinant Cdt proteins were able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce cytokines. The individual Cdt proteins were able to induce the synthesis by PBMCs of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 but not of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-12, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, with CdtC being the most potent and CdtB being the least potent cytokine inducer. There was evidence of synergism between these Cdt proteins in the stimulation of cytokine production, most markedly with gamma interferon, which required the minimum interaction of CdtB and -C to stimulate production.

            The EUO gene of chlamydia is highly expressed early in the developmental cycle, relative to other genes, but continues to be expressed throughout the active growth phases. The precise function of EUO protein is not known, but it binds to DNA in vitro. In this study, we developed a selection and amplification scheme for identifying chlamydial genomic fragments to which EUO preferentially binds in vitro. The scheme involved mixing recombinant EUO with a
            <jats:italic>Chlamydia psittaci</jats:italic>
            genomic library in a pBluescript plasmid vector in vitro, trapping EUO-bound plasmid clones on filters, and amplifying the clones in
            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            . After nine rounds of enrichment, the EUO binding sites of the three most highly enriched clones were identified by DNase I footprint analysis. All three clones had multiple binding sites of various sizes with no clear distinguishing feature other than they were AT-rich and were usually not located in putative promoter regions. We used limited site-specific mutagenesis to characterize the strongest binding site of the most-highly-enriched clone, which represented about 50% of the population after nine rounds. This mutagenesis identified a core binding site of 15 nucleotides (nt) whose sequence was used to find related sequences within each of the strong binding sites in the other two clones. Using the frequency of bases at specific positions within this group of sequences as a guide, we carried out trial-and-error searching with many related sequences, eliminating those which identified nonfootprinted sites. This process led us to the consensus 15-nt sequence AHGAAAWVTYTWDAY, which, when allowing two mismatches, picked out all of the strong binding sites and no nonfootprinting sites within the three enriched clones. This sequence may be useful for predicting additional possible EUO binding sites in the chlamydial genome.

            Plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) and membrane CD14 function to enhance the responses of monocytes to low concentrations of endotoxin. Surprisingly, recent reports have suggested that LBP or CD14 may be dispensable for macrophage responses to low concentrations of LPS or may even exert an inhibitory effect in the case of LBP. We therefore investigated whether LBP and CD14 participated in the response of mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) to LPS stimulation. In the presence of a low amount of plasma (&lt;1%) or of recombinant mouse or human LBP, PEM were found to respond to low concentrations of LPS (&lt;5 to 10 ng/ml) in an LBP- and CD14-dependent manner. However, tumor necrosis factor production (not interleukin-6 production) by LPS-stimulated PEM was reduced when cells were stimulated in the presence of higher concentrations of plasma or serum (5 or 10%). Yet, the inhibitory effect of plasma or serum was not mediated by LBP. Taken together with previous results obtained with
            <jats:italic>LBP</jats:italic>

            An effective new vaccine for the control of tuberculosis is badly needed. While current research attempts to improve vaccination are concentrating on new prophylactic or immunotherapeutic vaccines, virtually no emphasis has been placed on boosting individuals already inoculated with

However, if these mice are inoculated with the 30-kDa mycolyl transferase A protein in midlife, after challenge when aged they express levels of protection in the lungs comparable to those of young mice, associated with minimal pathological damage.

Here we provide direct evidence that a major surface protein, outer surface protein A (OspA), can induce arthritis.

            We investigated the role of the functional domains of anthrax toxins during infection. Three proteins produced by
            <jats:italic>Bacillus anthracis</jats:italic>
            , the protective antigen (PA), the lethal factor (LF), and the edema factor (EF), combine in pairs to produce the lethal (PA+LF) and edema (PA+EF) toxins. A genetic strategy was developed to introduce by allelic exchange specific point mutations or in-frame deletions into
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            toxin genes, thereby impairing either LF metalloprotease or EF adenylate cyclase activity or PA functional domains. In vivo effects of toxin mutations were analyzed in an experimental infection of mice. A tight correlation was observed between the properties of anthrax toxins delivered in vivo and their in vitro activities. The synergic effects of the lethal and edema toxins resulted purely from their enzymatic activities, suggesting that in vivo these toxins may act together. The PA-dependent antibody response to LF induced by immunization with live
            <jats:italic>B. anthracis</jats:italic>
            was used to follow the in vivo interaction of LF and PA. We found that the binding of LF to PA in vivo was necessary and sufficient for a strong antibody response against LF, whereas neither LF activity nor binding of lethal toxin complex to the cell surface was required. Mutant PA proteins were cleaved in mice sera. Thus, our data provide evidence that, during anthrax infection, PA may interact with LF before binding to the cell receptor. Immunoprotection studies indicated that the strain producing detoxified LF and EF, isogenic to the current live vaccine Sterne strain, is a safe candidate for use as a vaccine against anthrax.

The results obtained indicate that the composition of the fecal flora is genetically regulated.

Dehydration of an 88-h FRD1 biofilm revealed other IR bands that were also found in the spectrum of purified FRD1 alginate. These results provide evidence that alginate was present within the FRD1 biofilms and at greater relative concentrations at depths exceeding 1 μm, the analysis range for the ATR/FT-IR technique. After 88 h, biofilms of the nonmucoid strains produced amide II absorbances that were six to eight times as intense as those of the mucoid FRD1 parent strain. However, the cell densities in biofilms were similar, suggesting that FRD1 formed biofilms with most cells at depths that exceeded the analysis range of the ATR/FT-IR technique. SCLM analysis confirmed this result, demonstrating that nonmucoid strains formed densely packed biofilms that were generally less than 6 μm in depth. In contrast, FRD1 produced microcolonies that were approximately 40 μm in depth. An

            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>
            family of heat-labile enterotoxins having an AB5 structure. By substituting amino acids in the enzymatic A subunit that are highly conserved in all members of this family, we constructed 23 variants of CT that exhibited decreased or undetectable toxicity and we characterized their biological and biochemical properties. Many variants exhibited previously undescribed temperature-sensitive assembly of holotoxin and/or increased sensitivity to proteolysis, which in all cases correlated with exposure of epitopes of CT-A that are normally hidden in native CT holotoxin. Substitutions within and deletion of the entire active-site-occluding loop demonstrated a prominent role for His-44 and this loop in the structure and activity of CT. Several novel variants with wild-type assembly and stability showed significantly decreased toxicity and enzymatic activity (e.g., variants at positions R11, I16, R25, E29, and S68+V72). In most variants the reduction in toxicity was proportional to the decrease in enzymatic activity. For substitutions or insertions at E29 and Y30 the decrease in toxicity was 10- and 5-fold more than the reduction in enzymatic activity, but for variants with R25G, E110D, or E112D substitutions the decrease in enzymatic activity was 12- to 50-fold more than the reduction in toxicity. These variants may be useful as tools for additional studies on the cell biology of toxin action and/or as attenuated toxins for adjuvant or vaccine use.

            TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 × 10
            <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>

To determine whether the B-lymphocyte expansions characteristic of this syndrome represent polyclonal and virus-specific processes, the antigen specificity of B cells in lymphoid tissues of monkeys infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimeras was assessed using an inverse immunohistochemical assay with biotinylated HIV-1 envelope gp120 (Env) as an antigen probe. Env-binding B cells were found aggregated in lymph node and splenic germinal centers (GCs). Most Env-binding GCs also contained an unstained population of B cells, suggesting the GCs were formed by a polyclonal (oligoclonal) process. By day 42 following infection, Env-binding B cells were present in 19% of all lymph node GCs. Env-binding cells were present in 25% of GCs even during chronic infection. This extraordinarily high frequency of Env-specific B lymphocytes suggests that the expansion of virus-specific B cells may largely account for the follicular hyperplasia in AIDS virus-infected individuals.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

          <jats:p>Previously, we characterized two host protein binding elements located within the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome and assessed their functions in defective-interfering (DI) RNA replication. To determine the role of RNA secondary structures within these two host protein binding elements in viral replication, we explored the secondary structure of the 3′-terminal 166 nucleotides of the MHV strain JHM genome using limited RNase digestion assays. Our data indicate that multiple stem-loop and hairpin-loop structures exist within this region. Mutant and wild-type DIssEs were employed to test the function of secondary structure elements in DI RNA replication. Three stem structures were chosen as targets for the introduction of transversion mutations designed to destroy base pairing structures. Mutations predicted to destroy the base pairing of nucleotides 142 to 136 with nucleotides 68 to 74 exhibited a deleterious effect on DIssE replication. Destruction of base pairing between positions 96 to 99 and 116 to 113 also decreased DI RNA replication. Mutations interfering with the pairing of nucleotides 67 to 63 with nucleotides 52 to 56 had only minor effects on DIssE replication. The introduction of second complementary mutations which restored the predicted base pairing of positions 142 to 136 with 68 to 74 and nucleotides 96 to 99 with 116 to 113 largely ameliorated defects in replication ability, restoring DI RNA replication to levels comparable to that of wild-type DIssE RNA, suggesting that these secondary structures are important for efficient MHV replication. We also identified a conserved 23-nucleotide stem-loop structure involving nucleotides 142 to 132 and nucleotides 68 to 79. The upstream side of this conserved stem-loop is contained within a host protein binding element (nucleotides 166 to 129).</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

            Tat stimulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription requires Tat-dependent recruitment of human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to the HIV-1 promoter and the formation on the
            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>
            -acting response element (TAR) RNA of a P-TEFb–Tat–TAR ternary complex. We show here that the P-TEFb heterodimer of Cdk9-cyclin T1 is intrinsically incapable of forming a stable complex with Tat and TAR due to two built-in autoinhibitory mechanisms in P-TEFb. Both mechanisms exert little effect on the P-TEFb–Tat interaction but prevent the P-TEFb–Tat complex from binding to TAR RNA. The first autoinhibition arises from the unphosphorylated state of Cdk9, which establishes a P-TEFb conformation unfavorable for TAR recognition. Autophosphorylation of Cdk9 overcomes this inhibition by inducing conformational changes in P-TEFb, thereby exposing a region in cyclin T1 for possible TAR binding. An intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of cyclin T1 sterically blocks the P-TEFb–TAR interaction and constitutes the second autoinhibitory mechanism. This inhibition is relieved by the binding of the C-terminal region of cyclin T1 to the transcription elongation factor Tat-SF1 and perhaps other cellular factors. Upon release from the intramolecular interaction, the C-terminal region also interacts with RNA polymerase II and is required for HIV-1 transcription, suggesting its role in bridging the P-TEFb–Tat–TAR complex and the basal elongation apparatus. These data reveal novel control mechanisms for the assembly of a multicomponent transcription elongation complex at the HIV-1 promoter.

            Sixty-three clinical isolates of charcoal-black-pigmented, gram-positive coryneform rods were received for identification by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and were provisionally designated CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 (FCG4). Forty-five of these were characterized by morphological, physiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, cellular fatty acids, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses. Nitrate reduction, cellular fatty acid analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies segregated these strains into two groups: FCG4a (8 strains) and FCG4b (37 strains). The FCG4a strains, only one of which was from a female genitourinary source, produced cellular fatty acid and biochemical profiles similar to those observed with reference strains of
            <jats:italic>Rothia dentocariosa</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Rothia mucilaginosa</jats:italic>

            <jats:italic>Corynebacterium</jats:italic>

These samples, including 552 respiratory specimens and 48 nonrespiratory specimens, were collected from 333 patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from September to October 2003. The results of both assays were compared to the gold standard of combined culture results and clinical diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAPID BAP-MTB assay for respiratory specimens were 66.7% and 97.2%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 56.7% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for the RAPID BAP-MTB were 74.1% and 96.0%, respectively, and for the DTB assay they were 59.6% and 94.7%, respectively. For smear-negative samples, the sensitivity of the RAPID BAP-MTB and DTB assays was 57.1% and 40.5%, respectively.

Among the 48 nonrespiratory specimens, the RAPID BAP-MTB assay was positive in one biopsy sample from a patient with lumbar tuberculous spondylitis and one pus sample from a patient with tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy. Our results showed that the RAPID BAP-MTB assay is better than the DTB assay for both respiratory specimens and nonrespiratory specimens. The overall time for processing this assay is only 5 h. In addition, its diagnostic accuracy in smear-negative samples is as high as in smear-positive samples.

          <jats:p>We have used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and serotyping to build a phylogenetic framework for pneumococcal disease isolates in Scotland that provides a snapshot of the relationships between capsular type and genotype. The results show that while the MLST type correlates with the serotype, isolates within a serotype can belong to a number of individual clonal complexes or sequence types (STs). We also show that isolates of the same ST can express different capsular polysaccharides, i.e., display capsular switching, and that this phenomenon is observed both for capsular types commonly isolated from patients with invasive disease and for serogroups less commonly isolated from patients with invasive disease but which may commonly be carried asymptomatically in the human nasopharynx.</jats:p>",en,J Clin Microbiol,NA

            Reversible tetracycline-dependent gene regulation allows induction of expression with the tetracycline repressor (TetR) or gene silencing with the newly developed reverse mutant revTetR. We report here the implementation of both approaches with full regulatory range in gram-positive bacteria as exemplified in
            <jats:italic>Bacillus subtilis</jats:italic>

The phthiocerol and phthiodiolone dimycocerosate esters (PDIMs) comprise one such category of virulence-enhancing lipids. Recent work in several laboratories has established that the

Both mutants have altered colony morphology and do not synthesize PDIMs or glycosylphenol-PDIM.

This sensitivity is corrected by methionine and seems to result from destabilization of MetA (homoserine transsuccinylase), the first enzyme in methionine biosynthesis. The MetA protein is known to be sensitive to thermal inactivation, and

            mutants to both heat and acid and may oxidatively damage (carbonylate) destabilized MetA. While acid appears to impair methionine biosynthesis, it leads to derepression of MetA and may inhibit growth by causing toxic accumulation of denatured protein. This is supported by the observation that the overexpression of MetA in
            <jats:italic>ppk</jats:italic>
            mutants causes acid sensitivity that is not corrected by methionine. We propose that polyphosphate acts as a chemical chaperone that helps refold MetA and/or may stimulate proteolysis of toxic denatured protein. The instability of MetA protein may provide a metabolic fuse that blocks growth under conditions that denature proteins; the sensitivity of this fuse is modulated by polyphosphate.

            (GBS) is an important pathogen of neonates, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. GBS isolates associated with human infection produce one of nine antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharides which are thought to play a key role in virulence. A comparison of GBS polysaccharide structures of all nine known GBS serotypes together with the predicted amino acid sequences of the proteins that direct their synthesis suggests that the evolution of serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides has proceeded through en bloc replacement of individual glycosyltransferase genes with DNA sequences that encode enzymes with new linkage specificities. We found striking heterogeneity in amino acid sequences of synthetic enzymes with very similar functions, an observation that supports horizontal gene transfer rather than stepwise mutagenesis as a mechanism for capsule variation. Eight of the nine serotypes appear to be closely related both structurally and genetically, whereas serotype VIII is more distantly related. This similarity in polysaccharide structure strongly suggests that the evolutionary pressure toward antigenic variation exerted by acquired immunity is counterbalanced by a survival advantage conferred by conserved structural motifs of the GBS polysaccharides.

            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            strains exhibit high genomic diversity. In order to investigate this diversity, the unique genomic DNA sequences from a nonsequenced

            strain,
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            81-176, were identified by comparison with
            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            NCTC 11168 by using a shotgun DNA microarray approach. Up to 63 kb of new chromosomal DNA sequences unique to this pathogen were obtained. Eighty-six open reading frames were identified by the presence of uninterrupted coding regions encoding a minimum of 40 amino acids. In addition, this study shows that the whole-plasmid shotgun microarray approach is effective and provides a comprehensive coverage of DNA regions that differ between two closely related genomes. The two plasmids harbored by this
            <jats:italic>Campylobacter</jats:italic>
            strain, pTet and pVir, were also sequenced, with coverages of 2.5- and 2.9-fold, respectively, representing 72 and 92% of their complete nucleotide sequences. The unique chromosomal genes encode proteins involved in capsule and lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, restriction and modification systems, and respiratory metabolism. Several of these unique genes are likely associated with

            81-176 fitness and virulence. Interestingly, the comparison of

            <jats:italic>C. jejuni</jats:italic>
            ATCC 43431 revealed a single gene which encodes a probable TraG-like protein. The product of this gene might be associated with the mechanism of

            mRNA, the main determinants for She2p recognition are still unknown. To investigate the RNA-binding specificity of She2p, we isolated She2p-binding RNAs by in vivo selection from libraries of partially randomized
            <jats:italic>ASH1</jats:italic>
            localization elements. The RNAs isolated contained a similar loop-stem-loop structure with a highly conserved CGA triplet in one loop and a single conserved cytosine in the other loop. Mutating these conserved nucleotides or the stem separating them resulted in the loss of She2p binding and in the delocalization of a reporter mRNA. Using this information, we identified the same RNA motif in two other known bud-localized transcripts, suggesting that this motif is conserved among bud-localized mRNAs. These results show that mRNAs with zipcodes lacking primary sequence similarity can rely on a few conserved nucleotides properly oriented in their three-dimensional structure in order to be recognized by the same localization machinery.

          <jats:p>DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I) is a molecular target for the anticancer agent topotecan in the treatment of small cell lung cancer and ovarian carcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms by which topotecan treatment inhibits cancer cell proliferation are unclear. We describe here the identification of Topo I as a novel endogenous interaction partner for transcription factor c-Jun. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Topo I and c-Jun interact in transformed human cells in a manner that is dependent on JNK activity. c-Jun target gene epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was identified as a novel gene whose expression was specifically inhibited by topotecan. Moreover, Topo I overexpression supported c-Jun-mediated reporter gene activation and both genetic and chemical inhibition of c-Jun converted cells resistant to topotecan-elicited EGFR downregulation. Topotecan-elicited suppression of proliferation was rescued by exogenously expressed EGFR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the cooperation of the JNK-c-Jun pathway, Topo I, and EGFR in the positive regulation of HT-1080 cell proliferation. Together, these results have identified transcriptional coactivator Topo I as a first endogenous cofactor for c-Jun in the regulation of cell proliferation. In addition, the results of the present study strongly suggest that inhibition of EGFR expression is a novel mechanism by which topotecan inhibits cell proliferation in cancer therapy.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

The results suggest that the unopened brand of formula was not the source for transmission of spores to the infant and that the strain was distinct from previous botulism cases in the United Kingdom. Since environmental testing was not performed, it is not possible to deduce other sources of transmission.

          <jats:p>The type I receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase MuSK is essential for the neuromuscular junction formation. MuSK expression is tightly regulated during development, but the underlying mechanisms were unclear. Here we identified a novel mechanism by which MuSK expression may be regulated. A cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-like element in the 5′-flanking region of the MuSK gene binds to CREB1 (CRE-binding protein 1). Mutation of this element increases the MuSK promoter activity, suggesting a role for CREB1 in attenuation of MuSK expression. Interestingly, CREB mutants unable to bind to DNA also inhibit MuSK promoter activity, suggesting a CRE-independent inhibitory mechanism. In agreement, CREB1 could inhibit a mutant MuSK transgene reporter whose CRE site was mutated. We provide evidence that CREB interacts directly with MyoD, a myogenic factor essential for MuSK expression in muscle cells. Suppression of CREB expression by small interfering RNA increases MuSK promoter activity. These results demonstrate an important role for CREB1 in the regulation of MuSK expression.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

            Numerous studies indirectly implicate Rac GTPases in cancer. To investigate if Rac3 contributes to normal or malignant cell function, we generated
            <jats:italic>rac3</jats:italic>
            null mutants through gene targeting. These mice were viable, fertile, and lacked an obvious external phenotype. This shows Rac3 function is dispensable for embryonic development. Bcr/Abl is a deregulated tyrosine kinase that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia and Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in humans. Vav1, a hematopoiesis-specific exchange factor for Rac, was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in primary lymphomas from Bcr/Abl P190 transgenic mice, suggesting inappropriate Rac activation.

Moreover, our data suggest that interference with Rac3 activity, for example, by using geranyl-geranyltransferase inhibitors, may provide a positive clinical benefit for patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

            <jats:italic>ING2</jats:italic>
            is also involved in p53-mediated replicative senescence. ING2 protein expression increased in late-passage human primary cells, and it colocalizes with serine 15-phosphorylated p53. ING2 and p53 also complexed with the histone acetyltransferase p300. ING2 enhanced the interaction between p53 and p300 and acted as a cofactor for p300-mediated p53 acetylation. The level of ING2 expression directly modulated the onset of replicative senescence. While overexpression of ING2 induced senescence in young fibroblasts in a p53-dependent manner, expression of ING2 small interfering RNA delayed the onset of senescence. Hence, ING2 can act as a cofactor of p300 for p53 acetylation and thereby plays a positive regulatory role during p53-mediated replicative senescence.

          <jats:p>
            Betanodavirus B2 belongs to a group of functionally related proteins from the sense-strand RNA virus family
            <jats:italic>Nodaviridae</jats:italic>
            that suppress cellular RNA interference. The B2 proteins of insect alphanodaviruses block RNA interference by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thus preventing Dicer-mediated cleavage and the subsequent generation of short interfering RNAs. We show here that the fish betanodavirus B2 protein also binds dsRNA. Binding is sequence independent, and maximal binding occurs with dsRNA substrates greater than 20 bp in length. The binding of B2 to long dsRNA is sufficient to completely block Dicer cleavage of dsRNA in vitro. Protein-protein interaction studies indicated that B2 interacts with itself and with other dsRNA binding proteins, the interaction occurring through binding to shared dsRNA substrates. Induction of the dsRNA-dependent interferon response was not antagonized by B2, as the interferon-responsive
            <jats:italic>Mx</jats:italic>
            gene of permissive fish cells was induced by wild-type viral RNA1 but not by a B2 mutant. The induction of
            <jats:italic>Mx</jats:italic>
            instead relied solely on viral RNA1 accumulation, which is impaired in the B2 mutant. Hyperediting of virus dsRNA and site-specific editing of 5-HT2C mRNA were both antagonized by B2. RNA editing was not, however, observed in transfected wild-type or B2 mutant RNA1, suggesting that this pathway does not contribute to the RNA1 accumulation defect of the B2 mutant. We thus conclude that betanodavirus B2 is a dsRNA binding protein that sequesters and protects both long and short dsRNAs to protect betanodavirus from cellular RNA interference.

72-5ptase, promoted GLUT4 translocation and insertion into the plasma

translocation. Actin monomer binding, using latrunculin A treatment,
also blocked 72-5ptase-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.
72-5ptase expression promoted GLUT4 trafficking via a Rab11-dependent

          <jats:p>Bacterial communities reside in basal ice, sediment, and meltwater in the supra-, sub-, and proglacial environments of John Evans Glacier, Nunavut, Canada. We examined whether the subglacial bacterial community shares common members with the pro- and supraglacial communities, and by inference, whether it could be derived from communities in either of these environments (e.g., by ice overriding proglacial sediments or by in-wash of surface meltwaters). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes amplified from these environments revealed that the subglacial water, basal ice, and sediment communities were distinct from those detected in supraglacial meltwater and proglacial sediments, with 60 of 142 unique terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) detected exclusively in subglacial samples and only 8 T-RFs detected in all three environments. Supraglacial waters shared some T-RFs with subglacial water and ice, likely reflecting the seasonal flow of surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system, whereas supraglacial and proglacial communities shared the fewest T-RFs. Thus, the subglacial community at John Evans Glacier appears to be predominantly autochthonous rather than allochthonous, and it may be adapted to subglacial conditions. Chemical analysis of water and melted ice also revealed differences between the supraglacial and proglacial environments, particularly regarding electrical conductivity and nitrate, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Whereas the potential exists for common bacterial types to be broadly distributed throughout the glacial system, we have observed distinct bacterial communities in physically and chemically different glacial environments.</jats:p>",en,Appl Environ Microbiol,NA

            The physiological and pathological manifestations of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling arise from the specification of unique transcriptional programs dependent upon key nuclear effectors of the Ci/Gli family of transcription factors. However, the underlying mechanism by which Gli proteins regulate target gene transcription in the nucleus remains poorly understood. Here, we identify and characterize a physical and functional interaction between Gli3 and the MED12 subunit within the RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator. We show that Gli3 binds to MED12 and intact Mediator both in vitro and in vivo through a Gli3 transactivation domain (MBD;

Analysis of MBD truncation mutants revealed an excellent correlation between the in vivo activation strength of an MBD derivative and its ability to bind MED12 and intact Mediator in vitro, indicative of a critical functional interaction between the Gli3 MBD and the MED12 interface in Mediator. Disruption of the Gli3-MED12 interaction through dominant-negative interference inhibited, while RNA interference-mediated MED12 depletion enhanced, both MBD transactivation function and Gli3 target gene induction in response to Shh signaling. We propose that activated Gli3 physically targets the MED12 interface within Mediator in order to functionally reverse Mediator-dependent suppression of Shh target gene transcription. These findings thus link MED12 to the modulation of Gli3-dependent Shh signaling and further implicate Mediator in a broad range of developmental and pathological processes driven by Shh signal transduction.

          <jats:p>Localization of VP40 in Marburg virus (MBGV)-infected cells was studied by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analysis. VP40 was detected in association with nucleocapsid structures, present in viral inclusions and at sites of virus budding. Additionally, VP40 was identified in the foci of virus-induced membrane proliferation and in intracellular membrane clusters which had the appearance of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). VP40-containing MVBs were free of nucleocapsids. When analyzed by immunogold labeling, the concentration of VP40 in MVBs was six times higher than in nucleocapsid structures. Biochemical studies showed that recombinant VP40 represented a peripheral membrane protein that was stably associated with membranes by hydrophobic interaction. Recombinant VP40 was also found in association with membranes of MVBs and in filopodia- or lamellipodia-like protrusions at the cell surface. Antibodies against marker proteins of various cellular compartments showed that VP40-positive membranes contained Lamp-1 and the transferrin receptor, confirming that they belong to the late endosomal compartment. VP40-positive membranes were also associated with actin. Western blot analysis of purified MBGV structural proteins demonstrated trace amounts of actin, Lamp-1, and Rab11 (markers of recycling endosomes), while markers for other cellular compartments were absent. Our data indicate that MBGV VP40 was able to interact with membranes of late endosomes in the course of viral infection.

A 48-kDa polypeptide (RAF-2p48), a cellular splicing factor belonging to the DEAD-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases previously designated BAT1 (also UAP56), has now been identified as essential for RAF-2 stimulatory activity. Additionally, RAF-2p48 was independently identified as an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP)-interacting protein, NPI-5, in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mammalian cDNA library. In vitro, RAF-2p48 interacted with free NP but not with NP bound to RNA, and the RAF-2p48–NP complex was dissociated following addition of free RNA. Furthermore, RAF-2p48 facilitated formation of the NP-RNA complexes that likely serve as templates for the viral RNA polymerase. RAF-2p48 was shown, in both in vitro binding assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, to bind to the amino-terminal region of NP, a domain essential for RNA binding. Together, these observations suggest that RAF-2p48 facilitates NP-RNA interaction, thus leading to enhanced influenza virus RNA synthesis.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

            Adenovirus E4orf4 protein has been shown to induce transformed cell-specific, protein phosphatase 2A-dependent, and p53-independent apoptosis. It has been further reported that the E4orf4 apoptotic pathway is caspase-independent in CHO cells. Here, we show that E4orf4 induces caspase activation in the human cell lines H1299 and 293T. Caspase activation is required for apoptosis in 293T cells, but not in H1299 cells. Dominant negative mutants of caspase-8 and the death receptor adapter protein FADD/MORT1 inhibit E4orf4-induced apoptosis in 293T cells, suggesting that E4orf4 activates the death receptor pathway. Cytochrome
            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>
            is released into the cytosol in E4orf4-expressing cells, but caspase-9 is not required for induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, E4orf4 induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a caspase-8- and FADD/MORT1-dependent manner, and inhibition of ROS generation by 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron) inhibits E4orf4-induced apoptosis. Thus, our results demonstrate that E4orf4 engages the death receptor pathway to generate at least part of the molecular events required for E4orf4-induced apoptosis.

          <jats:p>In the replication cycle of hepadnavirus DNA, the double-stranded linear form of viral DNA is generated as a minor replicative intermediate, which is efficiently converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) by intramolecular recombination (W.

We previously found a binding site of transcription factor Yin and Yang 1 (YY1) in one terminal region of the double-stranded linear replicative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (M. Nakanishi-Matsui, Y. Hayashi, Y. Kitamura, and K. Koike, J. Virol. 74:5562–5568, 2000). However, it is not known whether the YY1-binding site is required for the intramolecular recombination of HBV DNA. In this study, we established an HBV-producing system in which the cccDNA appeared to be generated from the transfected linear DNA or the linear replicative DNA by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by both NHEJ and homologous recombination between terminally repeated sequences, respectively. When the YY1-binding site in the terminal region of transfected linear viral DNA was mutated, the cccDNA was generated merely by NHEJ. Results suggest that the YY1-binding site in the terminal region of linear replicative HBV DNA is required for intramolecular recombination between terminally repeated sequences.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

          <jats:p>
            Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) is an important equine and human pathogen of the Americas. In the adult mouse model, cDNA-derived, virulent V3000 inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) causes high-titer peripheral replication followed by neuroinvasion and lethal encephalitis. A single change (G to A) at nucleotide 3 (nt 3) of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the V3000 genome resulted in a virus (V3043) that was avirulent in mice. The mechanism of attenuation by the V3043 mutation was studied in vivo and in vitro. Kinetic studies of virus spread in adult mice following s.c. inoculation showed that V3043 replication was reduced in peripheral organs compared to that of V3000, titers in serum also were lower, and V3043 was cleared more rapidly from the periphery than V3000. Because clearance of V3043 from serum began 1 to 2 days prior to clearance of V3000, we examined the involvement of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) activity in VEE pathogenesis. In IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the course of the wild-type disease was extremely rapid, with all animals dying within 48 h (average survival time of 30 h compared to 7.7 days in the wild-type mice). The mutant V3043 was as virulent as the wild type (100% mortality, average survival time of 30 h). Virus titers in serum, peripheral organs, and the brain were similar in V3000- and V3043-infected IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice at all time points up until the death of the animals. Consistent with the in vivo data, the mutant virus exhibited reduced growth in vitro in several cell types except in cells that lacked a functional IFN-α/β pathway. In cells derived from IFN-α/βR
            <jats:sup>−/−</jats:sup>
            mice, the mutant virus showed no growth disadvantage compared to the wild-type virus, suggesting that IFN-α/β plays a major role in the attenuation of V3043 compared to V3000. There were no differences in the induction of IFN-α/β between V3000 and V3043, but the mutant virus was more sensitive than V3000 to the antiviral actions of IFN-α/β in two separate in vitro assays, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to IFN-α/β plays a major role in the in vivo attenuation of V3043.

In contrast to the rest of the parvoviruses, the VP1u of B19 is thought to occupy an external position in the virion, making this region a promising candidate for vaccine development. By using a monoclonal antibody against the most-N-terminal portion of VP1u, we revealed that this region rich in neutralizing epitopes is not accessible in native capsids. However, exposure of capsids to increasing temperatures or low pH led to its progressive accessibility without particle disassembly. Although unable to bind free virus or to block virus attachment to the cell, the anti-VP1u antibody was neutralizing, suggesting that the exposure of the epitope and the subsequent virus neutralization occur only after receptor attachment. The measurement of the VP1u-associated PLA
            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>
            activity of B19 capsids revealed that this region is also internal but becomes exposed in heat- and in low-pH-treated particles. In sharp contrast to native virions, the VP1u of baculovirus-derived B19 capsids was readily accessible in the absence of any treatment. These results indicate that stretches of VP1u of native B19 capsids harboring neutralizing epitopes and essential functional motifs are not external to the capsid.

            The processivity subunit of the herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase, UL42, is essential for viral replication and possesses both Pol- and DNA-binding activities. Previous studies demonstrated that the substitution of alanine for each of four arginine residues, which reside on the positively charged surface of UL42, resulted in decreased DNA binding affinity and a decreased ability to synthesize long-chain DNA by the polymerase. In this study, the effects of each substitution on the production of viral progeny, viral DNA replication, and DNA replication fidelity were examined. Each substitution mutant was able to complement the replication of a

          <jats:p>Studies of the complete hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle have become possible with the development of an infectious cell culture system using the genotype 2a isolate JFH-1. Taking advantage of this system in the present study, we investigated whether HCV infection leads to superinfection exclusion, a state in which HCV-infected cells are resistant to secondary HCV infection. To discriminate between viral genomes, we inserted genes encoding fluorescent proteins in frame into the 3′-terminal NS5A coding region. These genomes replicated to wild-type levels and supported the production of infectious virus particles. Upon simultaneous infection of Huh-7 cells, coreplication of both viral genomes in the same cell was detected. However, when infections were performed sequentially, secondary infection was severely impaired. This superinfection exclusion was neither due to a reduction of cell surface expression of CD81 and scavenger receptor BI, two molecules implicated in HCV entry, nor due to a functional block at the level of virus entry. Instead, superinfection exclusion was mediated primarily by interference at the level of HCV RNA translation and, presumably, also replication. In summary, our results describe the construction and characterization of viable monocistronic HCV reporter genomes allowing detection of viral replication in infected living cells. By using these genomes, we found that HCV induces superinfection exclusion, which is primarily due to interference at a postentry step.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

          <jats:p>The replication and pathogenicity of influenza A virus (FLUAV) are controlled in part by the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) system. This virus-host interplay is dependent on the production of IFN-α/β and on the capacity of the viral nonstructural protein NS1 to counteract the IFN system. Two different mechanisms have been described for NS1, namely, blocking the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and blocking posttranscriptional processing of cellular mRNAs. Here we directly compare the abilities of NS1 gene products from three different human FLUAV (H1N1) strains to counteract the antiviral host response. We found that A/PR/8/34 NS1 has a strong capacity to inhibit IRF3 and activation of the IFN-β promoter but is unable to suppress expression of other cellular genes. In contrast, the NS1 proteins of A/Tx/36/91 and of A/BM/1/18, the virus that caused the Spanish influenza pandemic, caused suppression of additional cellular gene expression. Thus, these NS1 proteins prevented the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral state, allowing virus replication even in the presence of IFN. Interestingly, the block in gene expression was dependent on a newly described NS1 domain that is important for interaction with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) component of the cellular pre-mRNA processing machinery but is not functional in A/PR/8/34 NS1. We identified the Phe-103 and Met-106 residues in NS1 as being critical for CPSF binding, together with the previously described C-terminal binding domain. Our results demonstrate the capacity of FLUAV NS1 to suppress the antiviral host defense at multiple levels and the existence of strain-specific differences that may modulate virus pathogenicity.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

          <jats:p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Originally identified in a variety of organisms ranging from plants to mammals, miRNAs have recently been identified in several viruses. Viral miRNAs may play a role in modulating both viral and host gene expression. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of 18 viral miRNAs from mouse fibroblasts lytically infected with the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The MCMV miRNAs are expressed at early times of infection and are scattered in small clusters throughout the genome with up to four distinct miRNAs processed from a single transcript. No significant homologies to human CMV-encoded miRNAs were found. Remarkably, as soon as 24 h after infection, MCMV miRNAs constituted about 35% of the total miRNA pool, and at 72 h postinfection, this proportion was increased to more than 60%. However, despite the abundance of viral miRNAs during the early phase of infection, the expression of some MCMV miRNAs appeared to be regulated. Hence, for three miRNAs we observed polyuridylation of their 3′ end, coupled to subsequent degradation. Individual knockout mutants of two of the most abundant MCMV miRNAs, miR-m01-4 and miR-M44-1, or a double knockout mutant of miR-m21-1 and miR-M23-2, incurred no or only a very mild growth deficit in murine embryonic fibroblasts in vitro.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

          <jats:p>Nearly a third of the human population is at risk of infection with the four serotypes of dengue viruses, and it is estimated that more than 100 million infections occur each year. A licensed vaccine for dengue viruses has become a global health priority. A major challenge to developing a dengue vaccine is the necessity to produce fairly uniform protective immune responses to all four dengue virus serotypes. We have developed two bivalent dengue virus vaccines, using a complex adenovirus vector, by incorporating the genes expressing premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of dengue virus types 1 and 2 (dengue-1 and -2, respectively) (CAdVax-Den12) or dengue-3 and -4 (CAdVax-Den34). Rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular inoculation of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulated by combining the two bivalent vaccine constructs. Vaccinated animals produced high-titer antibodies that neutralized all four serotypes of dengue viruses in vitro. The ability of the vaccine to induce rapid, as well as sustained, protective immune responses was examined with two separate live-virus challenges administered at 4 and 24 weeks after the final vaccination. For both of these virus challenge studies, significant protection from viremia was demonstrated for all four dengue virus serotypes in vaccinated animals. Viremia from dengue-1 and dengue-3 challenges was completely blocked, whereas viremia from dengue-2 and dengue-4 was significantly reduced, as well as delayed, compared to that of control-vaccinated animals. These results demonstrate that the tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation provides significant protection in rhesus macaques against challenge with all four dengue virus serotypes.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

            XXC, in the C-terminal domain SU. Here we have tested whether this motif is used for isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide of Env and whether this rearrangement is required for membrane fusion. We introduced the C225A and C228A mutations into Env and found that the former but not the latter mutant matured into covalently linked SU-TM complexes in transfected cells. Next, we constructed a secreted Env ectodomain and showed that it underwent incubation-dependent intersubunit disulfide isomerization on target cells. However, the rearrangement was blocked by the C225A mutation, suggesting that C
            <jats:sub>225</jats:sub>
            carried the isomerization-active thiol. Still, it was possible to reduce the intersubunit disulfide of the native C225A ectodomain mutant with dithiothreitol (DTT). The importance of the CXXC-mediated disulfide isomerization for infection was studied using murine leukemia virus vectors pseudotyped with wild-type or C225A HTLV-1 Env. We found that the mutant Env blocked infection, but this could be rescued with DTT. The fusion activity was tested in a fusion-from-within assay using a coculture of rat XC target and transfected BHK-21 effector cells. We found that the mutation blocked polykaryon formation, but this could be reversed with DTT. Similar DTT-reversible inhibition of infection and fusion was observed when a membrane-impermeable alkylator was present during the infection/fusion incubation. We conclude that the fusion activity of HTLV-1 Env is controlled by an SU CXXC-mediated isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide. Thus, this extends the applicability of the isomerization model from gammaretroviruses to deltaretroviruses.

            The measles virus (MV) accessory proteins V and C play important roles in MV replication and pathogenesis. Infection with recombinant MV lacking either V or C causes more cell death than infection with the parental vaccine-equivalent virus (MVvac), and C-deficient virus grows poorly relative to the parental virus. Here, we show that a major effector of the C phenotype is the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Using human HeLa cells stably deficient in PKR as a result of RNA interference-mediated knockdown (PKR

Furthermore, the results establish that a principal function of the MV C protein is to antagonize the proapoptotic and antiviral activities of PKR.

To directly investigate the relative importance of the carboxyl terminus of glycoprotein D (gD) in the presence or absence of gE, a recombinant virus (gDΔct) was constructed to specify a truncated gD lacking the carboxy-terminal 29 amino acids. Furthermore, two additional recombinant viruses were constructed by mutating from ATG to CTG the initiation codons of gE (gEctg) or both gE and gM (gEctg+gMctg), causing lack of expression of gE or both gE and gM, respectively. A fourth mutant virus was constructed to specify the gEctg+gDΔct mutations. The replication properties of these viruses were compared to those of a newly constructed recombinant virus unable to express UL20 due to alteration of the two initiation codons of UL20 (UL20ctgctg). All recombinant viruses were constructed by using the double-Red, site-directed mutagenesis system implemented on the HSV-1(F) genome cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. The gEctg, gEctg+gMctg, gDΔct, and gEctg+gDΔct viruses produced viral plaques on African monkey kidney cells (Vero), as well as other cells, that were on average approximately 30 to 50% smaller than those produced by the wild-type virus HSV-1(F). In contrast, the UL20ctgctg virus produced very small plaques containing three to five cells, as reported previously for the ΔUL20 virus lacking the entire UL20 gene. Viral replication kinetics of intracellular and extracellular viruses revealed that all recombinant viruses produced viral titers similar to those produced by the wild-type HSV-1(F) virus intracellularly and extracellularly at late times postinfection, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which replicated more than two-and-a-half logs less efficiently than HSV-1(F). Electron microscopy confirmed that all viruses, regardless of their different gene mutations, efficiently produced enveloped virions within infected cells, with the exception of the UL20ctgctg and ΔUL20 viruses, which accumulated high levels of unenveloped virions in the cytoplasm. These results show that the carboxyl terminus of gD and the full-length gE, either alone or in a redundant manner, are not essential in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and egress from infected cells. Similarly, gM and gE do not function alone or in a redundant manner in cytoplasmic envelopment and virion egress, confirming previous findings.

          <jats:p>To explore mechanisms of entry for Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) pseudotyped virions, we used comparative gene analysis to identify genes whose expression correlated with viral transduction. Candidate genes were identified by using EBOV GP pseudotyped virions to transduce human tumor cell lines that had previously been characterized by cDNA microarray. Transduction profiles for each of these cell lines were generated, and a significant positive correlation was observed between RhoC expression and permissivity for EBOV vector transduction. This correlation was not specific for EBOV vector alone as RhoC also correlated highly with transduction of vesicular stomatitis virus GP (VSVG) pseudotyped vector. Levels of RhoC protein in EBOV and VSV permissive and nonpermissive cells were consistent with the cDNA gene array findings. Additionally, vector transduction was elevated in cells that expressed high levels of endogenous RhoC but not RhoA. RhoB and RhoC overexpression significantly increased EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped vector transduction but had minimal effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) GP pseudotyped HIV or adeno-associated virus 2 vector entry, indicating that not all virus uptake was enhanced by expression of these molecules. RhoB and RhoC overexpression also significantly enhanced VSV infection. Similarly, overexpression of RhoC led to a significant increase in fusion of EBOV virus-like particles. Finally, ectopic expression of RhoC resulted in increased nonspecific endocytosis of fluorescent dextran and in formation of increased actin stress fibers compared to RhoA-transfected cells, suggesting that RhoC is enhancing macropinocytosis. In total, our studies implicate RhoB and RhoC in enhanced productive entry of some pseudovirions and suggest the involvement of actin-mediated macropinocytosis as a mechanism of uptake of EBOV GP and VSVG pseudotyped viral particles.</jats:p>",en,J Virol,NA

            Insulin degradation enzyme (IDE) is a 110-kDa zinc metalloprotease found in the cytosol of all cells. IDE degrades insulin and a variety of small proteins including amyloid-β. Recently, IDE has been proposed as the receptor for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) attachment. During our reassessment, some of the original studies were repeated and expanded in scope. We first confirmed that IDE antibody reduced VZV spread. For additional controls, we repeated the same experiments with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells as well as uninfected cells. There was a visible reduction in HSV spread but less than seen in the VZV system. Of greater importance, IDE antibody also inhibited the growth of uninfected cells. Second, we repeated the coprecipitation assays. We confirmed that antibodies to VZV gE (open reading frame 68) coprecipitated IDE and that anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated gE. However, the detected gE protein was not the mature 98-kDa form; rather, it was a precursor 73-kDa gE form found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional control experiments included VZV-infected cell cultures treated with tunicamycin to block gE glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum; again, the anti-IDE antibody coprecipitated a 73-kDa gE product. Finally, Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis of a chromatographically purified gE sample revealed four cellular proteins associated with the unfolded protein response: BiP (HSPA5), HSPA8, HSPD1, and PPIA (peptidyl-propyl

            Discontinuity of both strands of the chromosome is a lethal event in all living organisms because it compromises chromosome replication. As such, a diversity of DNA repair systems has evolved to repair double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In part, this diversity of DSB repair systems has evolved to repair breaks that arise in diverse physiologic circumstances or sequence contexts, including cellular states of nonreplication or breaks that arise between repeats. Mycobacteria elaborate a set of three genetically distinct DNA repair pathways: homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining, and single-strand annealing. As such, mycobacterial DSB repair diverges substantially from the standard model of prokaryotic DSB repair and represents an attractive new model system. In addition, the presence in mycobacteria of a DSB repair system that can repair DSBs in nonreplicating cells (nonhomologous end joining) or when DSBs arise between repeats (single-strand annealing) has clear potential relevance to

          <jats:p>Although most of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are incorporated in the host genome almost randomly, some non-LTR retrotransposons are incorporated into specific sequences within a target site. On the basis of structural and phylogenetic features, non-LTR retrotransposons are classified into two large groups, restriction enzyme-like endonuclease (RLE)-encoding elements and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)-encoding elements. All clades of RLE-encoding non-LTR retrotransposons include site-specific elements. However, only two of more than 20 APE-encoding clades, Tx1 and R1, contain site-specific non-LTR elements. Site-specific non-LTR retrotransposons usually target within multi-copy RNA genes, such as rRNA gene (rDNA) clusters, or repetitive genomic sequences, such as telomeric repeats; this behavior may be a symbiotic strategy to reduce the damage to the host genome. Site- and sequence-specificity are variable even among closely related non-LTR elements and appeared to have changed during evolution. In the APE-encoding elements, the primary determinant of the sequence- specific integration is APE itself, which nicks one strand of the target DNA during the initiation of target primed reverse transcription (TPRT). However, other factors, such as interaction between mRNA and the target DNA, and access to the target region in the nuclei also affect the sequence-specificity. In contrast, in the RLE-encoding elements, DNA-binding motifs appear to affect their sequence-specificity, rather than the RLE domain itself. Highly specific integration properties of these site-specific non-LTR elements make them ideal alternative tools for sequence-specific gene delivery, particularly for therapeutic purposes in human diseases.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

          <jats:p>Plasmids confer genetic information that benefits the bacterial cells containing them. In pathogenic bacteria, plasmids often harbor virulence determinants that enhance the pathogenicity of the bacterium. The ability to acquire iron in environments where it is limited, for instance the eukaryotic host, is a critical factor for bacterial growth. To acquire iron, bacteria have evolved specific iron uptake mechanisms. These systems are often chromosomally encoded, while those that are plasmid-encoded are rare. Two main plasmid types, ColV and pJM1, have been shown to harbor determinants that increase virulence by providing the cell with essential iron for growth. It is clear that these two plasmid groups evolved independently from each other since they do not share similarities either in the plasmid backbones or in the iron uptake systems they harbor. The siderophores aerobactin and salmochelin that are found on ColV plasmids fall in the hydroxamate and catechol group, respectively, whereas both functional groups are present in the anguibactin siderophore, the only iron uptake system found on pJM1-type plasmids. Besides siderophore-mediated iron uptake, ColV plasmids carry additional genes involved in iron metabolism. These systems include ABC transporters, hemolysins, and a hemoglobin protease. ColV- and pJM1-like plasmids have been shown to confer virulence to their bacterial host, and this trait can be completely ascribed to their encoded iron uptake systems.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

            Invading pathogens are exposed to a multitude of harmful conditions imposed by the host gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Bacterial defenses against these physical and chemical stresses are pivotal for successful host colonization and pathogenesis. Enteric pathogens, which are encountered due to the ingestion of or contact with contaminated foods or materials, are highly successful at surviving harsh conditions to colonize and cause the onset of host illness and disease. Pathogens such as

            <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic>
            have evolved elaborate defense mechanisms to adapt to the diverse range of stresses present along the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, these pathogens contain a multitude of defenses to help survive and escape from immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This chapter focuses on characterized bacterial defenses against pH, osmotic, oxidative, and nitrosative stresses with emphasis on both the direct and indirect mechanisms that contribute to the survival of each respective stress response.

          <jats:p>Although long recognized as a human pathogen, West Nile virus (WNV) emerged as a significant public health problem following its introduction and spread across North America. Subsequent years have seen a greater understanding of all aspects of this viral infection. The North American epidemic resulted in a further understanding of the virology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and epidemiology of WNV infection. Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic. Most symptomatic people experience an acute systemic febrile illness; less than 1% of infected people develop neuroinvasive disease, which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or anterior myelitis resulting in acute flaccid paralysis. Older age is associated with more severe illness and higher mortality; other risk factors for poor outcome have been challenging to identify. In addition to natural infection through mosquito bites, transfusion- and organ transplant–associated infections have occurred. Since there is no definitive treatment for WNV infection, protection from mosquito bites and other preventative measures are critical. WNV has reached an endemic pattern in North America, but the future epidemiologic pattern is uncertain.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

            To survive adverse conditions, some bacterial species are capable of developing into a cell type, the “spore,” which exhibits minimal metabolic activity and remains viable in the presence of multiple environmental challenges. For some pathogenic bacteria, this developmental state serves as a means of survival during transmission from one host to another. Spores are the highly infectious form of these bacteria. Upon entrance into a host, specific signals facilitate germination into metabolically active replicating organisms, resulting in disease pathogenesis. In this article, we will review spore structure and function in well-studied pathogens of two genera,

          <jats:p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most deadly bacterial infectious disease worldwide. Its treatment and control are threatened by increasing numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or nearly untreatable extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. New concepts are therefore urgently needed to understand the factors driving the TB epidemics and the spread of different strain populations, especially in association with drug resistance. Classical genotyping and, more recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the world population of tubercle bacilli is more diverse than previously thought. Several major phylogenetic lineages can be distinguished, which are associated with their sympatric host population. Distinct clonal (sub)populations can even coexist within infected patients. WGS is now used as the ultimate approach for differentiating clinical isolates and for linking phenotypic to genomic variation from lineage to strain levels. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the genetic diversity of TB strains translates into pathobiological consequences, and key molecular mechanisms probably involved in differential pathoadaptation of some main lineages have recently been identified. Evidence also accumulates on molecular mechanisms putatively fostering the emergence and rapid expansion of particular MDR and XDR strain groups in some world regions. However, further integrative studies will be needed for complete elucidation of the mechanisms that allow the pathogen to infect its host, acquire multidrug resistance, and transmit so efficiently. Such knowledge will be key for the development of the most effective new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccination strategies.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

          <jats:p>The modulation of tuberculosis (TB)-induced immunopathology caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coinfection remains incompletely understood but underlies the change seen in the natural history, presentation, and prognosis of TB in such patients. The deleterious combination of these two pathogens has been dubbed a “deadly syndemic,” with each favoring the replication of the other and thereby contributing to accelerated disease morbidity and mortality. HIV-1 is the best-recognized risk factor for the development of active TB and accounts for 13% of cases globally. The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has considerably mitigated this risk. Rapid roll-out of ART globally and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate ART for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count should lead to further reductions in HIV-1-associated TB incidence because susceptibility to TB is inversely proportional to CD4 count. However, it is important to note that even after successful ART, patients with HIV-1 are still at increased risk for TB. Indeed, in settings of high TB incidence, the occurrence of TB often remains the first presentation of, and thereby the entry into, HIV care. As advantageous as ART-induced immune recovery is, it may also give rise to immunopathology, especially in the lower-CD4-count strata in the form of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome will continue to impact the HIV-TB syndemic.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

Urogenital tuberculosis occurs at all age ranges, but it is predominant in males in their fourth and fifth decades. It is a serious, insidious disease, generally developing symptoms only at a late stage, which leads to a diagnostic delay with consequent urogenital organ destruction; there are reports of patients with renal failure as their initial clinical presentation. Although the condition has been long recognized by nephrologists, urologists, and infectious disease specialists, urogenital tuberculosis is still largely unknown. Even when suggestive findings such as hematuria, sterile pyuria, and recurrent urinary infections are present, we rarely remember this diagnostic possibility.

Metabolic disease may also predispose patients to the development of active tuberculosis, particularly in the case of diabetes mellitus. While hormonal therapy may be necessary in some instances, frequently these endocrine complications do not require specific interventions other than antituberculous therapy itself.

          <jats:p>The molecular composition of the cell wall is critical for the biology and ecology of each fungal species. Fungal walls are composed of matrix components that are embedded and linked to scaffolds of fibrous load-bearing polysaccharides. Most of the major cell wall components of fungal pathogens are not represented in humans, other mammals, or plants, and therefore the immune systems of animals and plants have evolved to recognize many of the conserved elements of fungal walls. For similar reasons the enzymes that assemble fungal cell wall components are excellent targets for antifungal chemotherapies and fungicides. However, for fungal pathogens, the cell wall is often disguised since key signature molecules for immune recognition are sometimes masked by immunologically inert molecules. Cell wall damage leads to the activation of sophisticated fail-safe mechanisms that shore up and repair walls to avoid catastrophic breaching of the integrity of the surface. The frontiers of research on fungal cell walls are moving from a descriptive phase defining the underlying genes and component parts of fungal walls to more dynamic analyses of how the various components are assembled, cross-linked, and modified in response to environmental signals. This review therefore discusses recent advances in research investigating the composition, synthesis, and regulation of cell walls and how the cell wall is targeted by immune recognition systems and the design of antifungal diagnostics and therapeutics.</jats:p>",en,Microbiol Spectr,NA

            Bax is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins which localizes to and uses mitochondria as its major site of action. Bax normally resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli, and it promotes apoptosis in two ways: (i) by disrupting mitochondrial membrane barrier function by formation of ion-permeable pores in mitochondrial membranes and (ii) by binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins via its BH3 domain and inhibiting their functions. A hairpin pair of amphipathic α-helices (α5-α6) in Bax has been predicted to participate in membrane insertion and pore formation by Bax. We mutagenized several charged residues in the α5-α6 domain of Bax, changing them to alanine. These substitution mutants of Bax constitutively localized to mitochondria and displayed a gain-of-function phenotype when expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, substitution of 8 out of 10 charged residues in the α5-α6 domain of Bax resulted in a loss of cytotoxicity in yeast but a gain-of-function phenotype in mammalian cells. The enhanced function of this Bax mutant was correlated with increased binding to Bcl-X

            , through a BH3-independent mechanism. These observations reveal new functions for the α5-α6 hairpin loop of Bax: (i) regulation of mitochondrial targeting and (ii) modulation of binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.

          <jats:p>Vav proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family GTPases which activate pathways leading to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and transcriptional alterations. Vav proteins contain several protein binding domains which can link cell surface receptors to downstream signaling proteins. Vav1 is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of multiple cell surface receptors. However, it is not known whether the recently identified isoforms Vav2 and Vav3, which are broadly expressed, can couple with similar classes of receptors, nor is it known whether all Vav isoforms possess identical functional activities. We expressed Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 at equivalent levels to directly compare the responses of the Vav proteins to receptor activation. Although each Vav isoform was tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation of representative receptor tyrosine kinases, integrin, and lymphocyte antigen receptors, we found unique aspects of Vav protein coupling in each receptor pathway. Each Vav protein coprecipitated with activated epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, and multiple phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the PDGF receptor were able to mediate Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav proteins was not detected in nonhematopoietic cells unless the protein tyrosine kinase Syk was also expressed, suggesting that integrin activation of Vav proteins may be restricted to cell types that express particular tyrosine kinases. In addition, we found that Vav1, but not Vav2 or Vav3, can efficiently cooperate with T-cell receptor signaling to enhance NFAT-dependent transcription, while Vav1 and Vav3, but not Vav2, can enhance NFκB-dependent transcription. Thus, although each Vav isoform can respond to similar cell surface receptors, there are isoform-specific differences in their activation of downstream signaling pathways.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

          <jats:p>The transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is mediated by coactivator proteins, including steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and its homologues and the general coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300. SRC1 contains an activation domain (AD1) which functions via recruitment of CBP and and p300. In this study, we have used yeast two-hybrid and in vitro interaction-peptide inhibition experiments to map the AD1 domain of SRC1 to a 35-residue sequence potentially containing two α-helices. We also define a 72-amino-acid sequence in CBP necessary for SRC1 binding, designated the SRC1 interaction domain (SID). We show that in contrast to SRC1, direct binding of CBP to the estrogen receptor is weak, suggesting that SRC1 functions primarily as an adaptor to recruit CBP and p300. In support of this, we show that the ability of SRC1 to enhance ligand-dependent nuclear receptor activity in transiently transfected cells is dependent upon the integrity of the AD1 region. In contrast, the putative histone acetyltransferase domain, the Per-Arnt-Sim basic helix-loop-helix domain, the glutamine-rich domain, and AD2 can each be removed without loss of ligand-induced activity. Remarkably, a construct corresponding to residues 631 to 970, which contains only the LXXLL motifs and the AD1 region of SRC1, retained strong coactivator activity in our assays.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

EGF-stimulated Ras, Raf, and Mek activation was significantly attenuated in Shp-2 mutant cells, suggesting that Shp-2 acts to promote Ras activation or to suppress the down-regulation of activated Ras. Biochemical analyses indicate that upon EGF stimulation, Shp-2 is recruited into a multiprotein complex assembled on the Gab1 docking molecule and that Shp-2 seems to exert its biological function by specifically dephosphorylating an unidentified molecule of 90 kDa in the complex. The mutant Shp-2

Evidence is also presented that Shp-2 does not appear to modulate the signal relay from EGF receptor to Ras through the Shc, Grb2, and Sos proteins. These results begin to elucidate the mechanism of Shp-2 function downstream of a receptor tyrosine kinase to promote the activation of the Ras-Erk pathway, with potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment.

Aberrant 3′-extended pre-tRNAs were detected, presumably due to stabilization of transcripts that fail to undergo correct transcription termination, and the accumulation of truncated tRNA fragments was also observed. Tandem affinity purification-tagged Lsm3p was associated with pre-tRNA primary transcripts and, less efficiently, with other unspliced pre-tRNA intermediates but not mature tRNAs. Association of the

The association of Lhp1p with larger RNA polymerase III transcripts, pre-RNase P RNA and the signal recognition particle RNA (scR1), was more drastically reduced. The impaired pre-tRNA processing seen on Lsm depletion is not, however, due solely to reduced Lhp1p association as evidenced by analysis of

            mice contained an enzymatic activity which cleaved DNA at sites of oxidized thymine residues (thymine glycol [Tg]). The activity was greater when Tg was paired with G than with A. This is in contrast to Nth1, which is more active against Tg:A pairs than Tg:G pairs. We suggest that there is a back-up mammalian repair activity which attacks Tg:G pairs with much greater efficiency than Tg:A pairs. The significance of this activity may relate to repair of oxidized 5-methyl cytosine residues (5meCyt). It was shown previously (S. Zuo, R. J. Boorstein, and G. W. Teebor, Nucleic Acids Res.

Thus, this previously undescribed, and hence novel, back-up enzyme activity may function to repair oxidized 5meCyt residues in DNA while also being sufficient to compensate for the loss of Nth1 in the mutant mice, thereby explaining the noninformative phenotype.

Selective binding to aza-dC-containing DNA suggests that the engaged DNMT is catalytically active in the cell. DNMT1b is a splice variant of the predominant maintenance activity DNMT1, while DNMT2 is a well-conserved protein with homologs in plants, yeast,
            <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>
            , humans, and mice. Despite the presence of motifs essential for transmethylation activity, catalytic activity of DNMT2 has never been reported. The data here suggest that DNMT2 is active in vivo when the endogenous genome is the target, both in human and mouse cell lines. We quantified relative global genomic activity of DNMT1, -2, -3a, and -3b in a mouse teratocarcinoma cell line. DNMT1 and -3b displayed the greatest in vivo binding avidity for aza-dC-containing genomic DNA in these cells. This study demonstrates that individual DNMTs can be tracked and that their binding to genomic DNA can be quantified in mammalian cells in vivo. The different DNMTs display a wide spectrum of genomic DNA-directed activity. The use of an antibody-based tracking method will allow specific DNMTs and their DNA targets to be recovered and analyzed in a physiological setting in chromatin.

            We characterized two essential putative GTPases, Nog1p and Lsg1p, that are found associated with free 60S ribosomal subunits affinity purified with the nuclear export adapter Nmd3p. Nog1p and Lsg1p are nucleolar and cytoplasmic, respectively, and are not simultaneously on the same particle, reflecting the path of Nmd3p shuttling in and out of the nucleus. Conditional mutants of both

Mutants of both genes also accumulate the 60S ribosomal reporter Rpl25-eGFP in the nucleolus, suggesting that both proteins are needed for subunit export from the nucleolus. Since Lsg1p is cytoplasmic, its role in nuclear export is likely to be indirect. We suggest that Lsg1p is needed to recycle an export factor(s) that shuttles from the nucleus associated with the nascent 60S subunit.

            The origin recognition complex (ORC) plays a central role in eukaryotic DNA replication. Here we describe a unique ORC-like complex in
            <jats:italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</jats:italic>
            , TIF4, which bound in an ATP-dependent manner to sequences required for cell cycle-controlled replication and gene amplification (ribosomal DNA [rDNA] type I elements). TIF4's mode of DNA recognition was distinct from that of other characterized ORCs, as it bound exclusively to single-stranded DNA. In contrast to yeast ORCs, TIF4 DNA binding activity was cell cycle regulated and peaked during S phase, coincident with the redistribution of the Orc2-related subunit, p69, from the cytoplasm to the macronucleus. Origin-binding activity and nuclear p69 immunoreactivity were further regulated during development, where they distinguished replicating from nonreplicating nuclei. Both activities were lost from germ line micronuclei following the programmed arrest of micronuclear replication. Replicating macronuclei stained with Orc2 antibodies throughout development in wild-type cells but failed to do so in the amplification-defective
            <jats:italic>rmm11</jats:italic>
            mutant. Collectively, these findings indicate that the regulation of TIF4 is intimately tied to the cell cycle and developmentally programmed replication cycles. They further implicate TIF4 in rDNA gene amplification. As type I elements interact with other sequence-specific single-strand breaks (in vitro and in vivo), the dynamic interplay of Orc-like (TIF4) and non-ORC-like proteins with this replication determinant may provide a novel mechanism for regulation.

Here, we found that exoenzymes associated with nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition were strongly correlated with inorganic nutrient levels, while those associated with carbon acquisition depended on the type of organic carbon available. We also show a linear relationship between carbon- and nitrogen-acquiring exoenzymes and a strong correlation between microbial biomass and exoenzymes, highlighting their significance to microbial productivity.

            Zinc is crucial for many biological processes, as it is an essential cofactor of enzymes and a structural component of regulatory and DNA binding proteins. Hence, all living cells require zinc to maintain constant intracellular levels. However, in excess, zinc is toxic. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. In bacteria, this is achieved by transcriptional regulators whose activity is mediated via zinc-dependent conformational changes promoting or preventing their binding to DNA. SmtB and Zur are important antagonistically acting bacterial regulators in mycobacteria. They sense changes in zinc concentrations in the femtomolar range and regulate transcription of genes for zinc acquisition, storage, and export. Here, we analyzed the role of SmtB and Zur in zinc homeostasis in

          <jats:p>DEK is a nuclear phosphoprotein implicated in oncogenesis and autoimmunity and a major component of metazoan chromatin. The intracellular cues that control the binding of DEK to DNA and its pleiotropic functions in DNA- and RNA-dependent processes have remained mainly elusive so far. Our recent finding that the phosphorylation status of DEK is altered during death receptor-mediated apoptosis suggested a potential involvement of DEK in stress signaling. In this study, we show that in cells committed to die, a portion of the cellular DEK pool is extensively posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Through interference with DEK expression, we further show that DEK promotes the repair of DNA lesions and protects cells from genotoxic agents that typically trigger poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. The posttranslational modification of DEK during apoptosis is accompanied by the removal of the protein from chromatin and its release into the extracellular space. Released modified DEK is recognized by autoantibodies present in the synovial fluids of patients affected by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis/juvenile idiopathic arthritis. These findings point to a crucial role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in shaping DEK's autoantigenic properties and in its function as a promoter of cell survival.</jats:p>",en,Mol Cell Biol,NA

            mutations are associated with breast cancer and genetically linked to the bone marrow disease Fanconi anemia (FA). The genomic instability of FA-J mutant cells suggests that FANCJ helicase functions in the replicational stress response. A putative helicase with sequence similarity to FANCJ in
            <jats:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</jats:italic>
            (DOG-1) and mouse (RTEL) is required for poly(G) tract maintenance, suggesting its involvement in the resolution of alternate DNA structures that impede replication. Under physiological conditions, guanine-rich sequences spontaneously assemble into four-stranded structures (G quadruplexes [G4]) that influence genomic stability. FANCJ unwound G4 DNA substrates in an ATPase-dependent manner. FANCJ G4 unwinding is specific since another superfamily 2 helicase, RECQ1, failed to unwind all G4 substrates tested under conditions in which the helicase unwound duplex DNA. Replication protein A stimulated FANCJ G4 unwinding, whereas the mismatch repair complex MSH2/MSH6 inhibited this activity. FANCJ-depleted cells treated with the G4-interactive compound telomestatin displayed impaired proliferation and elevated levels of apoptosis and DNA damage compared to small interfering RNA control cells, suggesting that G4 DNA is a physiological substrate of FANCJ. Although the FA pathway has been classically described in terms of interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, the cellular defects associated with
            <jats:italic>FANCJ</jats:italic>
            mutation extend beyond the reduced ability to repair ICLs and involve other types of DNA structural roadblocks to replication.
